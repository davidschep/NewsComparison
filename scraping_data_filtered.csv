0,NY Post,Jets blown out by Buffalo as Zach Wilson question now looms with playoff hopes tumbling,Brian Costello," ORCHARD PARK — Robert Saleh finally joined many Jets fans and decided he had seen enough of Zach Wilson. The Jets’ coach benched Wilson with 2:17 left in the third quarter of Sunday’s 32-6 loss to the Bills, replacing him with Tim Boyle after weeks of questions about whether the Jets should make a quarterback change. Saleh has resisted benching Wilson, the 2021 No. 2 overall pick, despite his struggles this season. But Sunday he finally gave in and sent Wilson to the bench after watching another dismal day of offense from the Jets. Wilson completed 7 of 15 passes for 81 yards with one touchdown and one interception before heading to the bench with the Jets down by 23. “[The score was] 29-6, just tried to see if we could get something going on the offensive side of the ball,” Saleh said when asked why he made the move. The Jets now have a short week with the first-place Dolphins coming to Met Life Stadium on Friday. Saleh said he would make a decision on Monday about who will start that game. If the Jets lose that game, their playoff hopes are over. Wilson, who has started every game this season after Aaron Rodgers was injured in Week 1, said he understood why Saleh made the move. “Frustrated, but I get it,” Wilson said. “Gotta score, gotta be in games. When it’s consecutive weeks of just doing nothing on offense, you can sit here and say last week we moved the ball, but we’re not scoring. Essentially it comes down to you’ve got to score points. When things aren’t getting done, change has got to be made and I understand that.” The benching comes on a day where the Jets actually scored a touchdown, ending a drought of 12 quarters and 40 straight possessions without reaching the end zone. But they did nothing else. They managed just 155 total yards and went 0-for-11 on third down. Wilson did not officially complete a pass to a wide receiver. He had one completion to Allen Lazard that was nullified by a penalty. “It felt like one of those games where we couldn’t do anything,” Wilson said. “It felt like one of those games everything felt really hard.” The loss drops the Jets to 4-6 and deals another blow to the team’s slim playoff hopes and the idea that Rodgers can return and save the season. The Bills improved to 6-5. At one point in the middle of the second quarter, the Jets had zero total yards, but they mounted a touchdown drive just before halftime after a fake punt gave them a spark. Wilson was sacked five times behind an offensive line that had four backups playing by the end of the first quarter. Boyle entered the game with the Jets already down 23 points. His first drive ended with a Garrett Wilson fumble, the Jets’ third turnover of the game. Boyle later threw an interception to bring the total to four. The previous success the Jets’ defense has had against Bills quarterback Josh Allen was nowhere to be found Sunday. Allen threw three touchdown passes, including an 81-yarder to Khalil Shakir. He completed 20 of 32 passes for 275 yards. His only interception came on a Hail Mary at the end of the first half. “They dominated us this week,” Jets cornerback D.J. Reed said. “It’s painful to say because it’s a division game, but you’ve got to give them their credit.” The Jets made some minor tweaks on offense with personnel and had offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett calling plays from the booth instead of the sideline. None of it worked. The players-only meeting this week? No effect. The Jets’ best play of the game was having punter Thomas Morstead throw a fake-punt pass to cornerback Brandin Echols. When the punter throwing to a cornerback is your best offense, you’re in trouble. “I don’t think anyone did anything today — players coaches, schemes,” Saleh said. “It was obviously not good enough. None of it was good enough.” The game started off with Jets rookie Xavier Gipson fumbling the opening kickoff and the Bills recovering. That led to the first of four Tyler Bass field goals in the game. When the Bills took a 9-0 lead in the second quarter, it felt like the game was over with the way the Jets’ offense was playing. Wilson threw an interception with 5:19 left in the second quarter that led to the Bills’ first touchdown of the day, a 5-yard pass from Allen to James Cook for a 16-0 lead. The Jets ended their 12-quarter touchdown drought just before it went to 13. Wilson threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Hall with 45 seconds remaining in the first half. They failed to convert the two-point try, leaving the score at 16-6 going into halftime. The 11-play touchdown drive featured two big fourth-down conversions. The first came on a fake punt at their own 26-yard line. Morstead completed an 18-yard pass to Echols for the first down that jump-started the drive. The Bills opened the second half with an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that was aided by a personal foul on Sauce Gardner. On fourth and-1 from the Jets’ 28, Allen threw to former Jet running back Ty Johnson, who raced up the sideline for a touchdown and a 22-6 lead. The Bills iced the game later in the third quarter when Allen found Shakir racing past Gardner for a long catch that then turned into an 81-yard touchdown when Jordan Whitehead, Gardner and Echols could not tackle him despite surrounding him. “I really don’t got any answers for you today, but I’ll try,” Jets tight end Tyler Conklin said. “It was just bad by all of us. I really don’t want to give you the same answer every week, but I don’t really got an answer for you. It was bad everywhere, right?” ","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:53 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
1,NY Post,Cops believe torso found on NYC beach may be vanished Irish filmmaker: sources,Joe Marino,"Police believe the human torso found on a Queens beach may be the corpse of acclaimed Irish filmmaker and photographer Ross Mc Donnell, whovanished more than a week ago, sources told The Post. Authorities are waiting for DNA test results to come back before they make an official pronouncement, law enforcement sources said. But cops thinks Mc Donnell — a 44-year-old Emmy winner whose bike was found locked up at Fort Tilden Beach on Nov. 7 — may have drowned in the churning waters, then had his body ravaged by some natural phenomenabefore it washed up on Breezy Point Beach Friday, sources said. Mc Donnell was last seen leaving his Taaffe Place home in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn at about 8:30 p.m. on Nov. 4, according to the NYPD. He may have been at Fort Tilden Beach later that night or early the next morning, according to a missing persons’ flyer that had been making the rounds. Gene Gallerano, the filmmaker’s close friend,told The Irish Timesthat it seemed like his pal went into the ocean, then suddenly disappeared. “He was last seen last Saturday night; the alarm was sounded on Sunday. We don’t know much more than that,” Gallerano said. “It’s been a very, very emotionally heavy week.” Mc Donnell’s bike was found at the beach three days later. At around noon on Friday, cops got a 911 call that said a human torso — with its legs still attached — was lying on the sand at the popular beach in southern Queens, police said. Authorities could not immediately say how the person had died, or even how old they were and what gender they appeared to be. Investigators have been seeking to track down Mc Donnell’s red puffy North Face vest, black and white sneakers, dark-colored khaki pants and black North Face backpack as they searched for clues about his disappearance. Mc Connell, a Dublin native who often travels abroad, took home an Emmy in 2021 for his cinematography work on the Showtime series “The Trade.” His debut feature film, “Colony,” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and won the IDFA First Feature Award as well as an Irish Film and Television Award Nomination, according to an online bio. He was also shortlisted for the world’s pre-eminent photography award “Prix Pictet” during its 2019 cycle, themed “Hope.” He’d been nominated for another Emmy in 2018 for directing the documentary “Elian,” which was produced by CNN Films, BBC and Jigsaw Productions.","Nov. 19, 2023, 2:47 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
2,NY Post,"NYC Council to 'roll over,' accept Mayor Eric Adams' budget cuts to NYPD, schools and more: sources",Carl Campanile," The City Council is expected to “roll over” and allow most if not all of thecontroversial budget cuts proposed by Mayor Eric Adams, sources predicted Sunday. The newly unveiled 2024 financial plan from City Hall would shrink thepolice departmentand slash funding to schools, cultural institutions and libraries — supposedly due to the increasing cost of housing migrants. Former Brooklyn Councilman Sal Albanese blasted proposed cuts and implored the Council to “get a spine.” “They are going to roll over. They are going to opt to do nothing and blame the mayor for the cuts,” Albanese said. “I’m urging them to get a spine. That’s a lot to ask for from the City Council.” The former mayoral candidate suggested that council members may be protecting legislative grants — “member items” — that they steer to pet programs in their districts. “Unbelievably the @NYCCouncil in June touted & spent a ton of $ on ‘member items’ without considering that the fiscal house of NYC was on very shaky grounds,”Albanese saidon X. “Of course irresponsible politics is more important than fiscal prudence.” While decrying the cuts, Council leaders have not indicated how they will proceed with the political hot potato. The Council and Adams approved the $107 billion city budget with much fanfare on June 30. But in September, Adams ordered city agencies to prepare to slash spending with cuts of 5% — and possibly a total of 15% by spring, blaming escalating migrant costs. In addition to the migrant costs, the city needs to compensate for the loss of federal pandemic funds and the costs of generous labor contractsand pay hikes for the workforce. “All of us are concerned about the impact that the reductions will have on the ability to provide essential services — from public safety to clean streets to public schools,” said Council Majority Leader Keith Powers (D-Manhattan). “Elected officials of all political persuasions need to be asking our federal and state partners to act urgently to help our city avoid drastic cuts.” Powers said the Council has not yet deliberated on how to proceed. The legislative body will hold an oversight hearing on the budget trims and ballooning migrant costs after the Thanksgiving holiday, according to the finance committee chairman, Councilman Justin Brannan. He did not say what action the Council would take on the mayor’s budget-shrinking plan. “The budget gaps we are facing were not a surprise and largely due to the end of federal COVID stimulus funds. As we have warned, temporary money was used to start or expand permanent programs, and now that money is finally running out. Costs related to the unprecedented migrant influx are a big piece of this puzzle but certainly not the only piece,” Brannan said last week. “For months, the Council has been asking the Administration for a full accounting of migrant costs and yet more than a year later, the only plans we’ve seen are more cuts to services that New Yorkers rely on. Managing and financing an international migrant crisis should not be the responsibility of a municipality and yet here we are. The bottom line is we desperately need help from our partners in Washington and Albany. New York City cannot be expected to handle this on our own.” The dilemma for the Council is that the city faces substantial multi-billion gaps in subsequent years, even after the cuts the mayor has proposed to balance the current spending plan, a budget expert said. So, the Council would have to take action to address the problem, not worsen it, said Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. “The mayor is right. We need to start now to reduce costs,” Rein said. Others, includingbudget analystand Post columnist Nicole Gelinas, said the mayor could solve the crisis by cutting migrant costs, instead of essential services. Adams’ spending reduction plan will be sent to the City Council this coming week, a City Hall spokesman said. ","Nov. 19, 2023, 8:11 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

4,NY Post,NBC drops lead golf analyst ahead of Hero World Challenge,Bridget Reilly," Paul Azinger will no longer be the lead golf analyst for NBC Sports, which was first reported by the Associated Press and has since been confirmed by Golf Digest. Azinger, 63, did not have his five-year contract renewed by the network, which caught him by surprise,according to the Golf Digest. “We want to thank Paul for his work with us over the last five years,” NBC said in a statement. “His insights, his work ethic and relationships in the golf industry are well known, and we appreciate what he brought to our team. We wish Paul the best in his future endeavors.” The decision by NBC comes as a potential larger overhaul of the network’s coverage and more changes could be coming down the line. “I have treasured working beside Dan Hicks and the other talented NBC broadcasters as well as lead producer Tommy Roy and all those behind the scenes,” Azinger said in a statement released on Sunday. “They are a remarkable team, and I will miss them tremendously. My thanks to them and the countless others who have supported me and helped me along the way during my work in television. I have faith in what the future holds for me, for NBC, and for the great game of golf.” Azinger has played in or broadcast more than 100 major championships and international team events across 40 years. His last event before his career at NBC came to a close was at the Ryder Cup in September which saw Team Europe beat the U.S.16½-11½. Azinger will not be on call for the Hero World Challenge,which will see the return of Tiger Woods. He took the job in 2019 after Johnny Miller’s retirement. Prior to arriving on the NBC scene, Azinger served as the lead analyst for ABC and ESPN from 2006-2015, and in 2016, he was a part of Fox Sports for the USGA championships.

5,NY Post,"NY ranked 'Least Free State,' with high taxes, debt, regulation: study",Carl Campanile," New York once again has the dubious distinction of beinglabeled “the least free state”in America, according to a report issued by libertarian-leaning think tank The Cato Institute. The Empire State ranked dead last — 50th — for policies impacting economic, social and personal freedoms in 2022,the report claims. By comparison, Florida ranked 2nd after New Hampshire as the most free state in the union. Cato said New York is a fiscal basket case. The state ranked 50th for economic freedom and scored at or near the bottom for debt andstate and local taxation, government consumption, land use and labor policy. “New York’s terrible economic freedom score is going to continue to drag the state down—and harm its ability to realize its full economic potential,” the Cato report authored by William Ruger and Jason Sorens said. “Combined, state and local taxes are crushing. Debt is down from years past but is still the highest in the country at 26.1 percent of income.” Wealthy residents in New York City pay among the highest combinedstate and local income taxesin the country — nearly 15% at the top level — and property taxes in the suburbs are also high. “It is little wonder that New Yorkers are fleeing the state in droves. New Yorkers have been voting with their feet for years, leaving a state with such a glorious past and a great magnet supercity in part because of its stifling policies that restrict freedom and opportunity. New York outpaced all other states by far in terms of net out-migration to other states,” co-author Ruger told The Post. “One of the worst problems for New York state as a whole is how New York City and Albany drive policy for the rest of the state,” he continued. “This allows left-wing ideologies and powerful concentrated interests to combine to run the state for their benefit while regular New Yorkers suffer. We especially see this in the regulatory area with policies like rent-control, eminent domain, renewable portfolio standards, minimum wage laws, and certificate of need laws.” Florida, by comparison, ranks high because it does not impose an income tax on its residents. New York has ranked last in every Cato study since it started reviewing data in 2000. The state gets higher marks from live-and-let-live Cato for its lower incarceration rates and for legalizing marijuana. New York ranked 9th for its criminal justice policies — the state’s highest score in any category. It ranked 49th for tobacco freedom for its public smoking bans and high cigarette taxes — $6.85 per pack, second only to $7.16 per pack in Illinois. Neighboring New Jersey fared little better, ranking 47th. California ranked 48th and Hawaii, 49th. Cato recommends New York policymakers slash spending and taxes, pay down debt and abolish rent control laws.","Nov. 19, 2023, 5:16 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
6,NY Post,Brigitte Macron says her 'head was in a mess' when she dated future French president when he was 15 and she was 40,Unknown,"French President Emmanuel Macron’s wife Brigitte Macron revealedher relationship anxieties from the early days of dating the future French leader– including concerns he would “fall in love with someone his age” after moving schools. “My head was in a mess,” Brigitte Macron said during a rare interview, given to the outlet Paris Match, and reported in the Daily Telegraph. “For me, such a young boy was crippling.” “Emmanuel had to leave for Paris,” Macron revealed. “I told myself that he would fall in love with someone his [own] age. It didn’t happen.” The couple’s age difference –she, 70, and he, 45– has remained a hot topic for the couple: Macron addressed the difference during an interview in 2017 with Elle France, telling the outlet “there are times in your life where you need to make vital choices.” “Of course, we have breakfast together, me and my wrinkles, him with his youth, but it’s like that,” Macron told Elle at the time. “If I did not make that choice, I would have missed out on my life. I had a lot of happiness with my children and, at the same time, felt I had to live ‘this love’ as Prevert used to say, to be fully happy.” The couple met while Brigitte taught drama at the Catholic Providence school in Amiens. Her daughter was Emmanuel’s classmate. The newest interview, translated and reported by the U.K.’s Daily Telegraph, reveals that Macron suffered significant anxiety over the age difference, which eventually caused a scandal when it came to light that she, a then-40-year-old teacher had engaged in a relationship with her 15-year-old pupil, Emmanuel. The French age of consent is 15, which was not enforced except in cases of sexual violence until the country passed the age into law, according to Politico’s European outlet. Emmanuel’s parents immediately decided to send him to a boarding school in Paris for the remainder of his studies, but that did not dissuade him from his relationship with Brigitte. After Emmanuel left for Paris, Brigitte stopped teaching drama and instead headed up Latin classes. She was married but estranged from her husband for years. She divorced him shortly before marrying Emmanuel. She also worried about how the relationship with the teenager would affect her children, who are the same age as Emmanuel. Brigitte said she waited a decade before pulling the trigger to make sure that the couple’s marriage would not deeply upset the rest of her family. “I took time so I would not wreck their lives,” Brigitte told Match. “That lasted 10 years, the time to put them on the rails. You can imagine what they were hearing. But I didn’t want to miss out on my life.” When the couple married in 2007, when Emmanuel was 29, he told his three stepchildren, “Thanks for accepting us, a not-quite-normal couple.” He won election as president of France at the age of 39 – the youngest-ever president for the country and roughly the same age his wife was when they met, according to The Independent.","Nov. 19, 2023, 1:25 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
7,NY Post,'Mighty Ducks' and 'Lethal Weapon 2' actor dead at 95,Jack Hobbs,"British actor Joss Ackland has died at the age of 95. The “Mighty Ducks” and “White Mischief” actor’s family said the star passed away “peacefully” while being “surrounded by family” on Sunday. “With his distinctive voice and commanding presence, Ackland brought a unique intensity and gravitas to his roles,” the statement continued. “He will be remembered as one of Britain’s most talented and beloved actors.” Ackland’s loved ones called him a “beloved father.” He had seven children with his wife of 51 years, Rosemary Kirkcaldy, before she died in 2002 from motor neuron disease. He also had 32 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. “Joss was a long-term client and great friend who remained lucid, erudite and mischievous to the very end,” Ackland’s rep told The Post. Details surrounding the prestigious CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) recipient’s cause of death are still unclear. Ackland’s six-decade career saw the North Kensington native acting with some of the most notable names to grace the silver screen, including Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench. The BAFTA nominee, who attended London’s Central School of Speech and Drama, made his stage debut in the 1945 production of “The Hasty Heart” at the age of 17. After a string of several lucrative roles, Ackland and his wife decided to move to South Africa until 1957 when police raided their home and confiscated the book “Black Beauty” over fears the story spoke out against apartheid. “Then one day we were raided by the police and they confiscated a book, ‘Black Beauty,’ because the horse was black,” the actor once told the Daily Mail. “I was faced with prison, so I got out in a hurry.” Following his return, the actor joined the prominent non-profit Old Vic theater group and his career took off in earnest. After starring in several high-profile films such as “Lethal Weapon 2” and the “Mighty Ducks” franchise as Hans opposite Emilio Estevez, Ackland told the BBC that he was a workaholic and regretted his appearance in some “awful films.” “I’m so tired of not being able to make a movie without a car chase, or the villain dying twice — it’s all exactly the same,” the actor said in 2001, per The Telegraph. He added: “I do a lot of crap, but if it’s not immoral, I don’t mind. I’m a workaholic.” ","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:08 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
8,NY Post,Argentina elects 'shock therapy' libertarian Javier Milei as president,Unknown,"BUENOS AIRES — Argentina elected libertarian outsider Javier Milei as its new president on Sunday, rolling the dice on an outsider with radical views to fix aneconomy battered by triple-digit inflation, a looming recession and rising poverty. Official results have not been released, but his rival, Peronist Economy Minister Sergio Massa, conceded in a speech. His candidacy was hampered by the country’s worst economic crisis in two decades while he has been at the helm. Milei is pledging economic shock therapy. His plans include shutting the central bank, ditching the peso, and slashing spending, potentially painful reforms that resonated with voters angry at the economic malaise, but sparked fears of austerity in others. “Milei is the new thing, he’s a bit of an unknown and it is a little scary, but it’s time to turn over a new page,” said 31-year-old restaurant worker Cristian as he voted on Sunday. But Milei’s challenges are enormous. He will have to deal with the empty coffers of the government and central bank, a creaking $44 billion debt program with the International Monetary Fund, inflation nearing 150% and a dizzying array of capital controls. With many Argentines not fully convinced by either candidate, some had characterized the vote as a choice of the “lesser evil”: fear of Milei’s painful economic medicine versus anger at Massa and his Peronist party for an economic crisis that has left Argentina deeply in debt and unable to tap global credit markets. Milei has been particularly popular among the young, who have grown up seeing their country lurch from one crisis to another. “Our generation is pushing the presidency of Milei to stop our country being a pariah,” said Agustina Lista, 22, a student in Buenos Aires. Milei’s win shakes up Argentina’s political landscape and economic roadmap, and could impact trade in grains, lithium and hydrocarbons. Milei has criticized China and Brazil, saying he won’t deal with “communists,” and favors stronger US ties. The shock rise of the 53-year-old economist and former TV pundit has been the story of the election, breaking the hegemony of the two main political forces on the left and the right — the Peronists and the main Together for Change conservative bloc. “The election marks a profound rupture in the system of political representation in Argentina,” said Julio Burdman, director of the consultancy Observatorio Electoral, ahead of the vote. Supporters of Massa, 51, an experienced political wheeler-dealer, had sought to appeal to voter fears about Milei’s volatile character and “chainsaw” plan to cut back the size of the state. “Milei’s policies scare me,” teacher Susana Martinez, 42, said on Sunday after she voted for Massa. Milei is also staunchly anti-abortion, favors looser gun laws and has called Argentine Pope Francis a socialist “son of a bitch.” He used to carry a chainsaw in a symbol of his planned cuts but shelved it in recent weeks to help boost his moderate image. After October’s first-round vote, Milei struck an uneasy alliance with the conservatives, which boosted his support. But he faces a highly fragmented Congress, with no single bloc having a majority, meaning that he will need to get backing from other factions to push through legislation. Milei’s coalition also does not have any regional governors or mayors. That may temper some of his more radical proposals. Long-suffering voters are likely to have little patience, and the threat of social unrest is never far below the surface. His backers say only he can uproot the political status quo and economic malaise that has dogged South America’s second-largest economy for years. “Milei is the only viable option so we do not end up in misery,” said Santiago Neria, a 34-year-old accountant.","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:19 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

10,NY Post,"Biden allies try to calm anxious Dems, stress there is no 2024 backup plan ahead of prez's 81st birthday: report",Ryan King,"Happy birthday, Mr. President. Gaffe-prone President Biden turns 81 Monday — and finds himself with virtually nothing to celebrate as key Democrats continue to fret over his advanced age and a new poll shows him losing support with younger voters. Some of his top allies have tried to convince major donors and other Democrats that like it or not, Biden is the party’s best bet to take on a GOP rival next year, according to an eyebrow-raising Washington Post exposé published Sunday. But anew NBC News poll suggestedthat even if Biden remains at the top of the Dem ticket, likely Republican nominee Donald Trump would beat him — the first time the 77-year-old ex-president surpassed his successor in a national general-election survey from the network. “The bad news is that everybody is wetting the bed inside of Biden world,” one fundraiser told The Washington Post. “It’s really an unhappy confluence of Biden world donors’ cocktail party friends saying ‘Can’t you get him not to run,’ which is stupid and absurd if you know Joe Biden.” Already the oldest president in United States history, Biden would be 86 years old by the conclusion of a second hypothetical term. At a private power conference in late September hosted by Ari Emanuel, brother of Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic angst was on full display — with one attendee worrying aloud about Biden being in serious jeopardy of losing the election and asking about the Democrats’ backup plan, the newspaper said. Former Biden chief of staff and staunch ally Ron Klain quickly fired back, underscoring that there was no Plan B and that the incumbent was a formidable nominee, according to the report. Attendees were reportedly splintered over Klain’s remarks, with some miffed by the lack of a backup plan and others grateful for his defense of Biden. Nearly six weeks later, Biden’s campaign officials trekked to Chicago for a private event where some attendees voiced frustrations that former President Barack Obama hadn’t done more to elevate his former veep. “The takeaway of the weekend was not, ‘Hey team, we’ve got to get the band back together to help Biden out,’ ” one attendee told Wa Po. “If this a supposedly existential threat and democracy is so challenged, then why aren’t you being more overt about it?” Not all the Democratic unease about Biden has been relegated to backstage grumbling. Democratic luminary David Axelrod, who helped pioneer Obama’s breakthrough 2008 presidential victory, has rankled Biden world with his public misgivings, though he later clarified he was not calling on Biden to drop out of the running. “I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,” Axelrod said to the New York Times’ Maureen Dowdin a Saturday column. “He thinks he can cheat nature here and it’s really risky. They’ve got a real problem if they’re counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too.” Axelrod’s remarks came against the backdrop of a spate of polling showing Trump ahead of Biden in five of six battleground states. The NBC poll, also out Sunday, had Trump edging out a slim lead over Biden — 46% to 44% — and strikingly eclipsing him among younger voters. The@POTUSis justly proud of his accomplishments.  Trump is a dangerous, unhinged  demagogue whose brazen disdain for the rules, norms, laws and institutions or democracy should be disqualifying.  But the stakes of miscalculation here are too dramatic to ignore. Among younger voters ages 18 to 34, Trump emerged on top 46% to 42% over Biden — a group that the president won by around 26 points in the 2020 election. NBC was not alone in pegging Biden down against Trump in a 2024 matchup, and the former president was up 1.6 percentage points over the incumbent in the latest Real Clear Politics aggregate of polling. Biden’s team has downplayed the polls, arguing they don’t capture the true picture as there is still a long way to go before the election next November. Trump has 91 criminal counts pending against him and is set to head to trial in March in the federal case in Washington DC charging him with trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Earlier this month, Biden allies took a big victory lap following Democratic wins in Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere in the off-year 2023 elections. They contended that those elections proved critics in the party had been unnecessarily hyperventilating and too caught up on current polls for an election just shy of a year away. “Time and again, Biden beats expectations. Happened in 2020, happened in 2022, happened on Tuesday night,” communications director Michael Tyler told reportersafter the off-year victories. “You see days, weeks, months of breathless predictions about how terrible things are gonna be for Joe Biden followed by an election day with historic victories,” he went on. Still, victories in 2022 and 2023 have failed to completely subdue Democratic anxiety about Biden’s chances in the general election. The Post reached out to the Biden campaign for comment. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) launched a long shot primary challenge against Biden last month, making hay about the incumbent’s viability. But Biden has a strong lead over both him and his other major primary opponent, author Marianne Williamson. While there aren’t any heavyweight Democrats challenging Biden for the nod, some have cultivated presidential buzz — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has embarked on tours of red states and ad blitz to champion progressive causes in conservative strongholds. He is set to square off with Florida Gov. Ron De Santis in a debate later this month, with his teamrecently cutting an adknocking the aspiring 2024 Republican presidential nominee on abortion. Newsom has endorsed Biden and insisted he won’t vie for the presidency in 2024.","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:27 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
11,NY Post,"Israel raids terrorists' luxury homes, take over parliament and police headquarters in Gaza",Ronny Reyes,"Israel raided Hamas terrorists’ luxury homes and parliament and police headquarters in Gaza City on Sunday, taking control of the sites and uncoveringa slew of weapons and tunnel entrances below them. Israeli paratroopers and armored units descended on the neighborhoods of Sheikh Ijlin and Rimal, executing a series of rocket launches and raids in the heart of Gaza City, where Hamas has maintained power since 2007. Much of the once-affluent area was already leveled by Israeli air strikessince the war beganlast month, but the Israel Defense Forces said it still encountered several Hamas operatives in Sheikh Ijlin and Rimal and killed them while also raiding some wealthy terrorist homes. The IDF said it found 35 tunnel shafts in the area leading to Hamas’ 300-mile underground network, along with dozens of weapon stashes,The Jerusalem Post reported. In addition, the IDF’s 7th Armored Brigade and Golani Infantry Brigade successfully took control of Hamas’ parliament building, its entire government complex and its police headquarters,The Times of Israel said. The IDF captured a Gazan university faculty building, too, that allegedly served to produce and develop weapons for the terrorist group. A Hamas training base, command center, interrogation rooms and detention cells were commandeered as well by the advancing Israeli army. Hamas officials have yet to comment on the fighting in Sheikh Ijlin and Rimal, as rolling communications blackouts have become the norm in Gaza. In other developments: Sunday’s Israeli assaults in Gaza are the latest in the IDF’s advancements in the north of the region as it seeks to eradicate Hamas after the terror group’s Oct. 7 attack that claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. More than 11,500 Palestinians have been killed since war broke out, according to the Hamas-linked Gaza’s Health Ministry, with at least 11 more killed on Sunday after an Israeli airstrike hit a home in Jabalia. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that two schools were hit by airstrikes in less than 24 hours in Gaza, killing many women and children. “Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians are seeking shelter at United Nations facilities throughout Gaza due to the intensified fighting,” Guterres said in a statement. “I reaffirm that our premises are inviolable.” The secretary-general’s statement came as  Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said shelters in Gaza cannot afford to become “collateral damage” in the Israel-Hamas war. “Most of the facilities hit had families in them – including older people, parents, and children,” Lazzarini said in a statement. “They were all clearly marked as UN buildings carrying a blue flag. “Once again, shelters meant to provide safety and protection to civilians have been hit, killing many people, including children,” he said. “These acts not only blatantly contravene the rules of war, they also show a total disregard for humanity.”","Nov. 19, 2023, 2:15 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
12,NY Post,Yemeni Houthi rebels hijack an Israeli-linked ship in the Red Sea and take 25 crew members hostage,Unknown,"JERUSALEM — Yemen’s Houthi rebelsseized an Israeli-linked cargo ship in a crucial Red Sea shipping route on Sunday, officials said, taking over two dozen crew members hostage and raising fears that regional tensions heightened overthe Israel-Hamas warwere playing out on a new maritime front. The Iran-backed Houthi rebelssaid they hijacked the ship over its connection to Israel and took the crew as hostages. The group warned that it would continue to target ships in international waters that were linked to or owned by Israelis until the end of Israel’s campaign against Gaza’s Hamas rulers. “All ships belonging to the Israeli enemy or that deal with it will become legitimate targets,” the Houthis said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office had blamed the Houthis for the attack on the Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier affiliated with an Israeli billionaire. It said the 25 crew members had a range of nationalities, including Bulgarian, Filipino, Mexican and Ukrainian, but that no Israelis had been on board. The Houthis said they were treating the crew members “in accordance with their Islamic values,” but did not elaborate on what that meant. Netanyahu’s office condemned the seizure as an “Iranian act of terror.” The Israeli military called the hijacking a “very grave incident of global consequence.” Israeli officials insisted the ship was British-owned and Japanese-operated. However, ownership details in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, which was founded by Abraham “Rami” Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. Ungar told The Associated Press he was aware of the incident but couldn’t comment as he awaited details. A ship linked to him experienced an explosion in 2021 in the Gulf of Oman. Israeli media blamed it on Iran at the time. The complex world of international shipping often involves a series of management companies, flags and owners stretching across the globe in a single vessel. Two U.S. defense officials confirmed that Houthi rebels seized the Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea on Sunday afternoon local time. The rebels descended on the cargo ship by repelling down from a helicopter, the officials said, confirming details first reported by NBC News. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. Twice in the last month, U.S. warships have intercepted missiles or drones from Yemen that were believed to be headed toward Israel or posing a threat to the American vessels. The USS Carney, a Navy destroyer,intercepted three land attack cruise missilesand several drones that were launched by Houthi forces toward the northern Red Sea last month. On Nov. 15 the USS Thomas Hudner, another destroyer, was sailing toward the Bab-el-Mandeb strait when the crew saw a drone, reported to have originated in Yemen. The ship shot down the drone over the water. The officials said the crew took action to ensure the safety of U.S. personnel, and there were no casualties or damage to the ship. Satellite tracking data from Marine Traffic.comanalyzed by the AP showed the Galaxy Leader traveling in the Red Sea southwest of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, more than a day ago. The vessel had been in Korfez, Turkey, and was on its way to Pipavav, India, at the time of the seizure reported by Israel. It had its Automatic Identification System tracker, or AIS, switched off, the data showed. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS active for safety reasons, but crews will turn them off if it appears they might be targeted or to smuggle contraband, which there was no immediate evidence to suggest was the case with the Galaxy Leader. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which provides warnings to sailors in the Persian Gulf and the wider region, put the hijacking as having occurred some 150 kilometers (90 miles) off the coast of Yemen’s port city of Hodeida, near the coast of Eritrea. The Red Sea, stretching from Egypt’s Suez Canal to the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait separating the Arabian Peninsula from Africa, remains a key trade route for global shipping and energy supplies. That’s why the U.S. Navy has stationed multiple ships in the sea since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7. Since 2019, a series of ships have come under attack at sea as Iran began breaking all the limits of its tattered nuclear deal with world powers. As Israel expands its devastating campaign against Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip following the militant group’s unprecedented attack on southern Israel, fears have grown that the military operations could escalate into a wider regional conflict.","Nov. 19, 2023, 2:58 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
13,NY Post,"No go, Joe: Putting the UN in charge of Gaza would be a sick joke",Eugene Kontorovich,"The Biden administration is pressuring Israel to define its plan for “the day after.” This is a bit like demanding America have a plan for postwar Japan weeks after Pearl Harbor. But worse, Washington insists the end goal of Israel’s war be the establishment of a Palestinian state. Understanding how unlikely Israel is to accept this suicidal proposal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggests it turn Gaza over to a United Nations peacekeeping force or other multinational presence. President Biden just called for the “international community” to provide “interim security measures.” The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon literally has “interim” in its name and has been failing at its job since 1978. The idea of international forces in Gaza repeats decades of mistakes. In every single case,UN forces and agencies failed to provide Israel any securityand were coopted and used by its enemies. After 1956’s Suez War, the Security Council created the United Nations Emergency Force to keep the peace on Israel’s border with Egypt. Right before the Six-Day War a decade later, Egypt demanded the peacekeepers leave — and they obliged. The UN Truce Supervision Organization, a Jerusalem-based force, fled when the Jordanians attacked Israel during that war, but the mission remains today, publishing reports critical of Israel and using its diplomatic plates to gum up parking in Jerusalem. The UN Disengagement Observer Force was created after 1973’s Yom Kippur War to keep the Syrian front quiet. When Islamist militias moved into the demilitarized zone during the Syrian Civil War, the international forces predictably responded by pulling their troops out. Then there’s that United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which did nothing to prevent the Palestine Liberation Organization’s and then Hezbollah’s innumerable attacks on Israel, leading to two wars. After 2006’s Second Lebanon War, it was used again as diplomatic fig leaf to bring about an Israeli withdrawal. In exchange, the Security Council required UNIFIL to disarm Hezbollah in the country’s south. Yet Hezbollah’s arsenal of rockets and missiles has grown more than tenfold since then. It’s ridiculous to talk about an international presence in Gaza when rockets from Lebanon rain down on Israeli homes under the nose of the largest peacekeeping force outside Africa. UN missions are particularly problematic because of the deep institutional bias of the organization, which has been on full display in this conflict: The secretary-general has made excuses for Hamas’ genocidal attack. And UN institutions in the Palestinian territories are actually taken over by terrorists, with the UN Relief and Works Agencyactively collaborating with or under the influence of Hamas. Blinken also suggested the possibility of a non-UN international force. Such ideas don’t have a better record. When Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it agreed on a European Union force to monitor border crossings and prevent weapons from being smuggled in. But when Hamas took power two years later, the EU observers took off. Israel also insisted it must continue to patrol the Egyptian border but was pressured into giving this role to Egypt — which allowed Gaza to be turned into the arsenal against Israeli cities it is today. The same story played out in the West Bank. In 2001, after the assassination of an Israeli government minister, Washington persuaded the Palestinian Authority to arrest and imprison the guilty terrorists. Israel was concerned this would be a sham, so America and Britain agreed to have their police officials supervise the prison. Four years later, Hamas threatened to liberate the prisoners, leading both countries to promptly remove their personnel to keep them out of harm’s way. No foreign presence will be willing to do the grinding work of ensuring Hamas is not reconstituted, a mission that would risk troops’ lives and potentially cause geopolitical tensions. When even America tolerates Iranian proxies’ drizzle of attacks on its bases in the Middle East, Israel cannot expect any outside actor in Gaza will stand up for the Jewish state’s security. Even more disastrous would be turning Gaza over to Mahmoud Abbas’ Palestinian Authority. It has actively cheered Hamas, and its Fatah faction even participated in the Oct. 7 massacre. If Fatah wanted a claim to govern Gaza, it should have fought against Hamas, not alongside it. If the goal is ensuring Israel’s security, history rules out both international forces and Palestinian factions. But it also points towards what could work. From 1967 to 2005, the Israeli army operated freely in Gaza. As a result, terrorists could not acquire rockets that could strike Tel Aviv or organize massive invasions of Israel. All that began when Israel completely evacuated Gaza and gave Fatah control. Similarly, attacks like this have not come from the West Bank because Israel maintains security control and control of the borders. What works for the West Bank and worked once in Gaza will work again. Israel left Gaza in 2005 because of (mistaken) international criticism of its “occupation”; for its trouble, it now gets falsely accused of genocide. Biden’s proposals have nothing to do with protecting Israel from future genocidal attacks and everything to do with not alienating his progressive base. But if Israel heeds them, it means the Jewish state loses even if it wins.","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:26 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
14,NY Post,Here are the 6 factors that might be turning your hair gray,Unknown,"Hair turning gray is a natural phenomenon that accompanies aging for most people. It is a visible sign of getting older, but have you ever wondered what really causes this transformation? When hair turns gray, it is due to the gradual decline of pigment cells within the hair follicles. The natural color of our hair comes from melanin, a pigment produced by specialized cells called melanocytes. These cells infuse melanin into the hair cells, determining its natural hue, whether it is blonde, brown, black or red. As we grow older, melanocytes begin producing less melanin, causing a gradual decrease in hair pigment. Over time, certain hair follicles cease melanin production entirely, leading to the growth of gray or white hair. Here’s more to know about this complex process and the combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that affect it: Your genetic makeup significantly influences when your hair might start graying. The timing and pace of this process are largely dictated by genetics. If premature graying runs in your family, there is a higher chance that you might also experience early graying. Certain genes are responsible for regulating the production of melanin. Variations in these genes can impact the quantity of melanin produced by your body and the rate at which pigment cells in hair follicles decline as time passes. Ethnicity also plays a part in this genetic predisposition. For instance, individuals with lighter skin tones often experience graying earlier than those with darker skin tones due to differences in melanin production. While genetics set the stage for when your hair might start to turn gray, other factors like stress, smoking, diet and environmental influences can accelerate the process. However, the genetic blueprint is the primary determinant of your hair graying. Stress does not directly cause hair to turn gray, but there is a correlation between chronic stress and premature graying. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but prolonged stress can affect the body in various ways, including potentially accelerating the graying process. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol, which, when produced in excess over a prolonged period, can impact the body’s normal functions. There is some indication from studies that stress could disrupt the melanocyte stem cells, which play a role in producing hair pigment. This disruption might potentially reduce melanin production, possibly triggering premature graying. While stress is not the sole cause of gray hair, managing stress levels through relaxation techniques, mindfulness practices and a healthy lifestyle might indirectly help slow down graying for some individuals. Smoking has been linked to premature aging, including the premature graying of hair. Chemicals that are present in cigarettes, and the toxins they release can have damaging effects on the body, including the hair follicles and the production of melanin. The harmful components in tobacco smoke can potentially cause oxidative stress, which damages cells. This oxidative stress can disrupt the normal functioning of melanocytes, leading to a decrease in melanin production and an earlier onset of gray hair. Nutritional deficiencies can potentially contribute to premature graying of hair, although the direct causal relationship between specific deficiencies and gray hair is not always straightforward. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients is crucial for overall health, including the health of your hair. Certain nutrients play essential roles in the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for hair color. For instance, deficiencies in vitamins like B12, D and E, and minerals like copper and iron can impact melanin production and overall hair health. When the body lacks these vital nutrients, it might affect the health and function of the hair follicles, potentially leading to changes in hair color. However, it is important to note that while nutritional deficiencies can impact hair health, genetics, age and other factors also significantly contribute to the natural graying process. Nutritional deficiencies might accelerate the process in some cases, but they might not be the sole cause of gray hair. Certain medical conditions often impact the body’s overall health and can affect hair pigmentation as a result. Some of these conditions include: Vitiligo:A skin condition where patches of skin lose their melanocytes, resulting in white patches. Sometimes, vitiligo can also affect hair, causing premature graying or whitening of hair in affected areas. Autoimmune disorders:Certain autoimmune conditions can affect the body’s immune response, leading to damage to melanocytes or interfering with the production of melanin. Thyroid disorders:Changes in thyroid hormone levels, particularly hypothyroidism, can impact various bodily functions, including hair health. While these medical conditions can contribute to premature graying, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Addressing the underlying medical condition might help manage or slow down the progression of premature graying in some cases. Pollutants such as vehicle emissions, industrial pollutants, heavy metals and certain chemicals can generate oxidative stress in the body, which can damage the melanocytes. Prolonged exposure to pollutants can interfere with the cells’ ability to produce melanin. As a result, hair might turn gray prematurely or lose its natural pigment. Minimizing exposure to pollutants through lifestyle changes, reducing exposure to cigarette smoke and living in less polluted environments might help support overall hair health and potentially slow down premature graying. Interestingly, hair does not actually “turn” gray; it grows that way from the root. So, when you notice gray hairs, it is because new hair follicles are producing hair without pigment. Despite the popular belief that plucking one gray hair will cause several more to grow in its place, that is a myth. Plucking a gray hair will not make more grow back in its place, but it is best to leave them alone as constant plucking can damage hair follicles. While there is no scientifically proven way to reverse gray hair permanently, some lifestyle changes or treatments like hair dyes, supplements or specific hair care routines might help slow down or temporarily disguise the graying process.","Nov. 19, 2023, 9:22 a.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

That’s atacitadmission that MLB was wrongto yank the 2021 classicfrom the Big Peach — since Manfred justified that decision as based on Georgia’s then-new voting law, which remains in effect. Back then, the law was the target of a massive liberal smear campaign, with no less than President Biden raging at  “Jim Crow 2.0” and urging MLB to make Atlanta suffer for it. The accusation was always utterly unhinged: The law simply rolled back some extreme easy-voting rules imposed during the pandemic. Adding to the injustice, MLB moved the game to Denver — though Colorado’s voting lawswere more restrictivethan Georgia’safterthe reform. By the way, Georgia’s next electionsproved the critics wrong, with record turnout andzerosign that of black disenfranchisement. But back in 2021, corporate America (including MLB) was deep in its Black Lives Matter cringe, indulging all manner of nonsense in the wake of the George Floyd riots. And Democrats from Biden on down were trying to exploit these issues to pass a national voting law; the prez (andour own Sen. Chuck Schumer) felt no compunction about smearing Georgia to benefit the Democratic Party. So (largely black) Atlanta businesses and workers lost out on the All-Star largesse. Manfred’s decision now is at least a quasi make-good for his 2021 insult: Consider it MLB eating some crow. Biden, Schumer and Democrats generally still owe Atlanta — indeed, all of Georgia — some fulsome apologies.","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:24 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

18,NY Post,David Axelrod doubles down on Biden criticism after president reportedly called him a 'prick',Unknown,"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod doubled down after President Biden reportedly called him a “prick”and argued that the president has a “real problem” if he thinks he can “cheat nature.” New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd defended Axelrod in a column published on Sunday, criticizing Biden for engaging in “petty feuds.” “I don’t care about them thinking I’m a prick — that’s fine,” Axelrod told Dowd. “I hope they don’t think the polls are wrong, because they’re not.” Axelrod, who Dowd noted has defended Biden in the past, told Dowd that Biden thinks he can “cheat nature,” drawing a comparison to Hillary Clinton. “I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,” Axelrod said.“He thinks he can cheat nature here and it’s really risky. They’ve got a real problem if they’re counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too.” Politico columnist Jonathan Martin wrote in early November that Biden called Axelrod a “prick” in private. “The president’s flash of anger indicates that he may be in denial, surrounded by enablers who are sugarcoating a grim political forecast,” Dowd wrote. Dowd said the president shouldn’t have a “chip on his shoulder,” and noted Axelrod received a ton of messages from others who agreed with his assessment of the latest polling. “But he should not indulge the Irish chip on his shoulder. He needs to gather the sharpest minds in his party and hear what they have to say, not engage in petty feuds,” Dowd wrote. Axelrod urged the president to consider whether it might be “wise” to drop outof the race following a poll that showed Biden trailing Donald Trump in several key battleground states. Axelrod reacted to Martin’s reporting during an appearance on CNN. “Listen, I understand he was irritated because I raised concerns that many, many Democrats had. And again, you know, my feeling is either get out or get going. But the status quo, the way they were approaching the campaign, this sort of ‘What, me, worry?’ attitude about the campaign was not going to get him to where he needs to go,” he said.

19,NY Post,Angel Reese fires back as rumors swirl around LSU star's status,Andrew Crane,"Angel Reese didn’t provide many details about the ongoing LSU saga, but a six-word post on social media appeared to push back on reports surrounding her benching and mysterious absence from the team. “please don’t believe everything you read,”Reese wrote on X. Reese, who became one of women’s college basketball’s stars as the Tigers won the NCAA tournament in April, was benched in the second half of LSU’s game against Kent State on Tuesday, and she didn’t play Friday against Southeastern Louisiana. Reese’s post on X occurred one day after sheadded a photo of an LSU courtwith a cart filled with basketballs to her Instagram story, though she didn’t provide any context to the photo or clarify whether it meant she was practicing with the team. The strange sequence started Tuesday, when Reese scored 11 points in 13 minutes against Kent State butdidn’t play across the final two quartersdue to a coach’s decision, according to LSU head coach Kim Mulkey. But three days later, when Reese didn’t even travel with the team for their game, her status took a strange turn. “You want me to explain why? It’s very obvious Angel was not in uniform,” Mulkey said postgame Friday. “Angel is a part of this basketball team and we hope to see her sooner than later.” LSU, which won the national title last season behind Reese and entered 2023-24 as contenders again, lost its opener to then-No. 20 Colorado before winning its past five games. please don’t believe everything you read.

20,NY Post,This reconfigured Rangers line making impact amid hot start,Mollie Walker," The Rangers earned their franchise record-setting12th win through the first 15 gamesof the season on the backs of the fourth line. There was Jimmy Vesey, skating in his 11th straight game after getting scratched in two of the first three contests, scoring two go-ahead goals Saturday in a matchup with the Devils that carried a little more meaning than most. The game-winner came on a rebound of a Tyler Pitlick shot off the rush, which bounced off the right pad of Devils goalie Vitek Vanecek and onto Vesey’s stick. Quickly flipping to his backhand, the second-time Ranger whacked the puck in before thrusting his stick into the air in celebration. “The line was fantastic,” head coach Peter Laviolette said of the fourth unit, which has featured Barclay Goodrow in the middle of Vesey and Pitlick in the last four games. “[Vesey] was the guy at the end of the [play] that put it in the net, but the line was really good. They made good decisions. They were heavy to play against. They turned things over in the offensive zone, they generated some. “Big game like [Saturday night] against a good team in our division. It’s nice to see guys like that chip in and have a really big night.” The loss of Filip Chytil to injured reserve created the Rangers’ fourth line as we’ve known it. Goodrow, who had played wing through the first 10 games of the season, moved to the middle as the Rangers’ centers were bumped up throughout the lineup. In 32:43 of ice time, according to Natural Stat Trick, Vesey, Goodrow and Pitlick have been on for two Rangers goals and just one against. Laviolette frequently credits the trio with handling some of the toughest minutes each and every game. That sort of role hasn’t allowed for many offensive opportunities, but they sure picked their spots in that 5-3 win over the Devils. If there’s anything to nitpick about the Rangers’ third-best record in the NHL entering Sunday’s slate of games, it’s that it’s come in spite of little even-strength production from the top line and a couple of key players who the team usually relies on. Mika Zibanejad hasn’t scored since Oct. 30 and is still searching for his first five-on-five goal. Kaapo Kakko hasn’t scored since Oct. 21 and has just two points on the season. And the first unit of Zibanejad, Chris Kreider and Blake Wheeler can certainly bring more during five-on-five play. The Rangers, however, have a supporting cast that is finding ways to make up for it. On Saturday night, it was the fourth line, with Vesey leading the way and upping his goal total to three. Last Sunday night in a shootout win over the Blue Jackets, it was Alexis Lafreniere, who is contributing more to the team this season than he had in the previous three combined. Erik Gustafsson’s 11 points (three goals, eight assists) is tied for the third most on the Rangers. Vincent Trocheck’s 14 points (four goals, 10 assists) isn’t even an accurate representation of how invaluable he’s been this season. Even rookie Will Cuylle is finding ways to chip in with three goals and two assists. “I think we’re a mature group,” Vesey said. “I think our structure is a big part of that, and I think just top to bottom we have a solid team and we believe in ourselves.”","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:55 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
21,NY Post,Islanders winger makes most of opportunity with promising performance,Ethan Sears,"Hudson Fasching had played eight games for the Islanders this season prior to Thursday. But not this version of Hudson Fasching. The version of Fasching that entered the lineup for a banged-up Matt Martin in Seattle resembled the version of Fasching that entered the lineup for a banged-up Cal Clutterbuck last December. That version of Fasching played straight-line hockey, forechecking and retrieving pucks with aplomb. That version of Fasching was opportunistic, seizing chances to contribute offensively whenever they presented themselves and always seeming to play up ice. That version of Fasching never left the lineup once he got in. That version of Fasching contributed heavily to the Islanders’5-4 win over the Flames on Saturday, scoring his first goal of the season. Nice to see him again. “Obviously it’s great playing with those guys [Clutterbuck and Casey Cizikas],” Fasching said after the game. “They’re hard-nosed players, they forecheck really well. Makes it predictable. Makes it easier to play with. You know where they’re gonna be. We’re a good forechecking line and we get the pucks back quite often. Make some plays off of it.” Fasching’s comfort on the fourth line was evident last season, too. But once Clutterbuck returned, he shuffled easily to the third line where his style of play meshed well with Zach Parise and Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Those results have not been there this season when Fasching has gotten time on the third line with Anders Lee and Pageau. Martin, according to coach Lane Lambert, is currently dealing with an upper-body tweak, which conveniently allows for Fasching to play in his spot without making Martin a healthy scratch. After the two games that Fasching played in Seattle and Calgary, though, coupled with the fact that the Islanders just broke a seven-game losing streak against the Flames, taking him off the fourth line on Wednesday against the Flyers would not seem to be in the offing, whether Martin is healthy or not. “He’s got some speed there. He’s a headsy player,” Lambert said of Fasching after the win over Calgary. “A guy who sees the play well, protects the puck down low well. Scored a huge goal for us tonight.” The goal came as a result of Fasching being at the right place at the right time, recovering a loose puck in the offensive zone and wiring it past Jacob Markstrom. “I was just trying to settle it and tried to take a quick peak, make sure there wasn’t any blatant thing I was missing and then I just went for it,” Fasching said. “Took a shot. Feels good to get the first one. That one’s always fun to get out of the way.” The Islanders’ crowded bottom-six always seemed as though it would threaten the Identity Line from being automatically inserted into the lineup every night. That reality is now coming to fruition. “I try to play the same game regardless,” Fasching said, when asked if things are different for him on the fourth line than elsewhere. “I try to stay true to myself a little bit. I know their game, I know they’re gonna forecheck well. It’s a little more predictable, I guess.” Fasching might be playing the same game, but it seems to fit better with Cizikas and Clutterbuck alongside him. And this version of him, recall, does not take no for an answer when it comes to playing time. “That’s the mentality of it and I always have to believe that and believe in myself,” Fasching said. “We got a good team. We rotate guys in and out. If I’m not in the lineup, it is what it is and I gotta find a way to get in and add value to stay in the lineup.”","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:44 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
22,NY Post,Giants Week 11 report card: Defense earns gold star,Paul Schwartz," Grading the Giants’ win over the Commanderson Sunday: If you saw this coming, raise your hand. What a wild ride for Tommy De Vito, who earned his first NFL win in his second start, completing 18 of 26 passes for 246 yards and three touchdowns. That is a passer rating of 137.7. That is nuts. Sure, he ran his way into a bunch of the incredible nine sacks allowed but he held onto the ball. De Vito’s toss to Saquon Barkley for a 24-yard TD was placed perfectly. Barkley made a nice leaping catch on the sideline for a 21-yard gain on the first series. He had minus-2 rushing yards until a 36-yard gain on the final play of the third quarter. Barkley (14-83 rushing, 4-57 receiving, two TDs) played with great heart. Darius Slayton had a 40-yard TD before exiting with an arm injury. TE Daniel Bellinger (3-38) got involved. Going 5-for-14 on third downs was not great, but it was tolerable. Grade: B You force five turnovers, you get a gold star. There were interceptions from Darnay Holmes and Nick Mc Cloud and a game-sealing pick-six by Isaiah Simmons. Dexter Lawrence, on one series in the second quarter, dropped Brian Robinson for a 2-yard gain and sacked Howell for an 8-yard loss. On another series in the fourth quarter, he deflected a pass at the line and then hit Sam Howell’s arm on an interception. Kayvon Thibodeaux had a run stop for a 1-yard loss on Brian Robinson and two of the team’s four sacks — plus a late penalty that nearly was costly. Bobby Okereke (14 tackles) forced a fumble in the third quarter that was recovered by Micah Mc Fadden. Xavier Mc Kinney recovered a fumble. Jason Pinnock dropped an interception in the second quarter. Howell (31 of 45, 255 yards, 1 TD, 3 INTs) was a mess. WR Terry Mc Laurin (5-43) was held in check. Grade: A Jamie Gillan did not do his job on his first punt, sending it into the end zone for a touchback. Near the end of the first half, Gillan’s 36-yard punt handed the Commanders good field position. Gillan did force a fair catch on the 8-yard line in the third quarter. His final punt came at a critical time and went for 48 yards, with no return. Holmes made a nice tackle on Jamison Crowder’s punt return of minus-3 yards. Dane Belton forced a fumble on a kickoff return that was recovered by Gevarrius Owens to start the second half. Randy Bullock hit a 36-yard field goal and had four touchbacks on kickoffs. Grade: A The Giants came out throwing with De Vito — give credit to Brian Daboll for not being afraid to let the rookie air it out a bit. Also give credit to offensive coordinator Mike Kafka for designing plays that freed up receivers for big plays down the field. Wink Martindale had the Commanders’ number in the two-game season sweep. The Giants had nine players on the field on a Washington field goal in the third quarter. There are supposed to be nine, right? Grade: B+","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:29 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
23,NY Post,"Jalen Brunson, Donte Di Vincenzo bringing Villanova bond to thriving Knicks backcourt",Stefan Bondy," MINNEAPOLIS — Donte Di Vincenzo was the quieter of the roommates at Villanova, content to play his video games in silence. Jalen Brunson preferred chatting and blasting his music, whether it was Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber. “He would play that loud as hell,” Di Vincenzo said. It was annoying, Di Vincenzo says, but somehow worked. Through three years at Villanova and two national championships, the pair became best friends — regardless of Brunson’s taste in music and their clashing personalities. “He bugs the hell out of me,” Di Vincenzo says. “When I’m quiet, it doesn’t sit well with him. So he’s going to keep nagging me until I talk to him.” Today, in a development neither dared to predict while Wildcats, the introvert and extrovert, are teammates in the NBA, starting the last two games as the Knicks’ backcourt while leading the team to its sixth win in its last seven games. Their highlight together in the NBA, at least thus far, was a combined 57 pointsin a victory Saturday, when Brunson and Di Vincenzo took turns carving up the Hornets. Di Vincenzo’s 25 points were a career high. “We envisioned playing in the NBA. We envisioned all that stuff, but not this,” Brunson says. “Jokingly, maybe, but never really a serious thought.” Brunson and Di Vincenzo first talked at an airport around 2013. Di Vincenzo, a high school star in Delaware, had already committed to Villanova. He tried to recruit Brunson, a five-star prospect out of Illinois who, at the time, had other plans. “He was like, ‘Hey, why don’t you come to Villanova?’ ” Brunson said. “I remember just laughing and saying, ‘No.’ And then fast forward a year later, I’m committing.” Their success was unprecedented at the Philadelphia school. Two NCAA championships. A National Player of the Year award for Brunson. A Final 4 Most Outstanding Player recognition for Di Vincenzo. They became legends at Villanova but neither were considered star NBA prospects, especially Brunson, who fell to the second round of the 2018 draft. Five years later, they’re operating on contracts with over $150 million guaranteed combined. Brunson is easily a top-10 NBA point guard while averaging 24.2 points and shooting 48 percent on 3-pointers. He’s on a path toward his first All-Star game and picked up a familiar supporter. “I would love for him to get an All-Star berth,” Di Vincenzo says. “I think he is [an All-Star]. I think we have two All-Stars on this team [with Julius Randle]. And I thought that last year watching these guys.” Di Vincenzo, unlike the many evaluators who allowed Brunson to sink to the second round, isn’t surprised by the success. He had a close view of the come-up. “All his footwork, all his dribble-up 3s,” Di Vincenzo said. “Everything that he’s doing, I’ve been seeing for eight or nine years now.” Di Vincenzo’s path in the NBA wasn’t quite as linearly upwards as Brunson’s. He found success early as a role player in Milwaukee but missed the team’s 2021 championship run after tearing a ligament in his ankle and struggled to recover the following season. Then last season, with Golden State, Di Vincenzo recouped his value and signed the $50 million deal with the Knicks in free agency. His start in New York was predictably bumpy, but the 26-year-old seemed to find his footing recently while displaying the disruptive defense and off-ball cutting that made him so intriguing to Tom Thibodeau. “I’m not surprised because I’ve seen it,” Brunson said, “but to be able to see it now as a teammate on this stage, it’s like surreal now.” The Villanova reunion extends beyond the backcourt. Because of an injury and illness to regular-starters Quentin Grimes and RJ Barrett, Friday night’s Knicks lineup featured three former college teammates — Brunson, Di Vincenzo and Josh Hart. The strangeness of the PA announcement wasn’t lost on Di Vincenzo. “It’s super weird. Super weird,” he said. “They’re announcing the starters and it’s like, ‘From Villanova. … From Villanova. … From Villanova. It was like Villanova going up against the Wizards.” The ’Nova Knicks won that game, 122-108, and won the next night in Charlotte because two former roommates caught fire. They’ve come a long way from the competing interests of quiet video games and the volume control of Taylor Swift. “Exactly. I’m the quiet one,” Di Vincenzo said. “I’m trying to play my video games and stuff like that. But it just worked. It worked for us.” ","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:20 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
24,NY Post,CBP hid damning details about near-fatal crash at secret flight school: whistleblower,Josh Christenson,"US Customs and Border Protectionhas papered over damning details about a near-fatal helicopter crash during a training exercise in 2021 — and attempted to cover up violations at an “under wraps” flight school that led to it, whistleblower disclosures exclusively obtained by The Post show. CBP’s Air and Marine Operations division abused its authority and posed “a substantial and specific danger to public safety” by allowing most of its AS350 light helicopter fleet to operate without crash-resistant fuel tanks and permitting pilots to fly with minimal certifications, according to the revelations. Contemporaneous reportsfrom a local ABC affiliatefirst described how on May 12, 2021, a CBP pilot in training and an instructor narrowly avoided death while conducting an aerial maneuver that caused their helicopter to crash in a field near a flight training center outside Oklahoma City. The aircraft “burned down to its frame” and the pair were briefly hospitalized for minor injuries — but the reasons for the crash were never disclosed. The flight school has been kept by the agency to give pilots with minimal qualifications the opportunity to “pad their logbooks” — but its first student was the trainee who crashed the helicopter, according to a source familiar with the investigation. “This leads to minimally skilled aviators being selected for very difficult pilot assignments,” the source said, pointing out that half a dozen other mishaps have also occurred due to poor safety precautions. The Air and Marine Operations division’s congressionally-approved funding is tied to the number of flight hours it regularly records, but those hours are supposed to be focused primarily on operational duties rather than flight training with instructors, according to the source. An internal aircraft mishap report following the May 2021 crash found that the pilot in training was the “primary causal factor” and had presented an invalid waiver concerning accumulated flight hours before operating the helicopter. But officials tried to conceal the details of that report. Robert Blanchard, executive director of CBP’s Air and Marine Operations division, “improperly attempted to remove critical information” about the hiring process and dangerous fuel tanks from the mishap report’s findings in December 2021 “because of the potential for a negative public response and increased legal liability,” according to whistleblower allegations later confirmed by an internal agency investigation. The CBP division’s former director of training, safety and standards, Joseph Adams, made the protected disclosures about the alleged cover-up to the Office of Special Counsel after having been asked by Blanchard to remove the information from the final report. Adams, who retired in October after 15 years in the division, also alleged CBP higher-ups retaliated against him and threatened to dismiss him following the disclosures, which the Office of Special Counsel is separately investigating. Last June, Special Counsel Henry Kerner referred the whistleblower allegations to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who tapped CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility to look into the matter. That office in May 2023 confirmed that 81 of 97 light helicopters are operating without crash-resistant fuel tanks and that Blanchard tried to remove that fact and information about the hiring process for new pilots from his division’s final mishap report, having told Adams in an email the details were “a litigation hazard.” Crash-resistant fuel tanks have been required by all CBP light enforcement helicopters since 2006 to reduce the likelihood of fires following an accident. However, the Office of Professional Responsibility stated in the report that the helicopter fleet was not in violation of Federal Aviation Administration standards, since the requirement does not apply to aircraft designed before 1994. The Office of Special Counsel approached CBP in August asking whether the report’s findings would prompt disciplinary actions by the agency and whether it intended to retrofit any crash-resistant fuel tanks in the future. On Sept. 18, CBP Acting Commissioner Troy Miller responded in a letter that the report would be forwarded to an internal Discipline Review Board for consideration, while noting that Blanchard was slated to retire by the end of the month, according to a copy obtained by The Post. “CBP has determined not to retrofit the current fleet,” the letter also states, but “has elected to retire and replace the fleet lacking crash worth [sic] fuel tanks.” The letter makes no mention of changes to policies surrounding the flight school. In a separate letter to the White House in July laying out the details of his case, Adams also pointed out that other CBP officials aware of the reasons for the crash had been allowed to quietly retire before any disciplinary action was taken, according to a copy obtained by The Post. The Office of Special Counsel has followed-up with a request to CBP for an additional supplemental report on the case, which a response expected by Nov. 20. “CBP takes its obligations to investigate all allegations seriously and has an established process to investigate whistleblower matters,” a spokesperson told The Post in a statement. “CBP’s Air and Marine Operations remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of training and proficiency for our pilots.” “AMO operates and maintains all of their light enforcement helicopters in accordance with manufacturers’ standards and Federal Aviation Regulations,” the spokesperson added, also mentioning that some aircraft were in the process of being retrofitted for crash-resistant fuel tanks. The Office of Special Counsel did not respond to a request for comment.","Nov. 19, 2023, 9:52 a.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
25,NY Post,When will NYC do something about the 'staggering' number of e-bike fire deaths?,Nicole Gelinas,"Eric Adams ran for office on a public-safety platform two years ago. His crime record is mixed, but public safety isn’t just crime: E-bike and e-scooter battery-firedeaths are reaching“staggering” levels, his fire commissioner says. So it’s not good the unrelated corruption suspicions swirling around the mayor involve . . . pressuring the FDNY to ignore safety rules, rules that inconvenienced donors and their friends. The familiar story unfolded again last week: A powerful fire obliterated a Brooklyn brownstone. Three people from three generations of the West family, ages 33 to 81, perished. As has become common over three years, the cause was a battery charging an e-scooter, blocking exits. So far, 17 of this year’s 93 fire deaths are from such batteries. Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh calls it “devastating.” Twenty-seven New Yorkers have diedin these fires since 2021, the year after the city legalized e-bikes and similar devices. (No one had ever died in such a fire before.) We’ve quickly reversed decades of progress. Between 2014 and 2020, the average number of annual civilian fire deaths was 66, including a low of 43 in 2017, the smallest number in a century. Last year, though, fire deaths, at 102, exceeded 100 for the first time in 19 years, and we’ll likely top 100 deaths this year, too. This represents a 51% increase, relative to the average before e-bikes became ubiquitous. As the FDNY notes, e-battery fire deaths exceed electrical fire deaths. So what’s the city doing? Nothing that has yielded any practical results. The City Council banned the sale of e-batteries that don’t meet Underwriters Lab-type safety standards — a law it has no way of enforcing (council members don’t want police to seize illegal batteries from cyclists). The council also instructed the FDNY and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to launch an education campaign. And it directed the mayor to set up a trade-in program, whereby e-battery owners can swap uncertified batteries for certified ones, at city expense — but Adams hasn’t set it up. The only way to prevent more deaths is for the FDNY to call for a ban on residential e-battery storage and charging, just as it bans home storage of gasoline and other flammable or hazardous materials. Current law, enacted in the de Blasio administration’s final weeks, purposelyexemptsthe storage and charging of “not more than five” such devices in a home. And it’s time for the FDNY to push for enforcement of various fire-code laws thatalreadyban hazardous commercial-industrial activity in homes. Most of the city’s e-bikes and e-scooters are used for delivering food — and delivery apps, like Uber Eats, Grubhub and Door Dash, should be responsible for storing, maintaining and charging their workers’ equipment at commercial-industrial sites. Only after a ban is it time to figure out any exemptions: for example, the storage ofone UL-certified battery for a personal bicycle, registered with the local FDNY firehouse and, if applicable, with the property owner’s landlord. But Adams remains passive on the e-bike inferno crisis. His fire commissioner, Kavanagh, blames the food-delivery apps and sellers of unregulated batteries, saying they have “blood on their hands” — even though the city is in the position to better regulate these industries, by cutting off their markets. Does she think they are going to regulate themselves? And, surprise, surprise, Grubhub execs have given Adams $13,675 for his 2021 and 2025 mayoral campaigns (asthe Daily News reported). This might be coincidence. Except Adams isalreadyengulfed in a scandal over putting pressure on the FDNY to ignore critical safety rules infast-tracking occupancy permitsfor a new building for the Turkish consulate when he was borough president and soon-to-be-mayor in 2021. This pressure just so happened to help Adams’ Turkish-related financial supporters. In his first year as mayor, Adams also wanted the Department of Buildings — historically perceived, not incorrectly, by real-estate developers as being more malleable to pressure than the FDNY — totake over fire-inspection duties. So Adams is already mixed up in a scandal over suspicion of sacrificing public safety for donor convenience — when a different donor has a stake in maintaining the new business as usual on e-bike deliveries, the city’s biggest noncrime public-safety crisis. Well, maybe a different type of crime. No wonder the city continues to burn.","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:48 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
26,NY Post,A timeline of key moments from former first lady Rosalynn Carter’s 96 years,Unknown,"PLAINS, Ga. — Landmarks and notable events in the life of former first lady Rosalynn Carter,who died Sunday at the age of 96: Eleanor Rosalynn Smith is born at her family home in Plains, Georgia. She is the daughter of Wilburn Edgar Smith, a mechanic, and Allie Murray Smith, a seamstress and postal worker. “Miss Lillian” Carter, a neighbor and nurse who delivered Rosalynn, brings her son, Jimmy, nearly 3 years old, to meet the new baby. Rosalynn’s father dies, leaving her to help her mother raise her younger siblings. She begins dating Jimmy Carter, now a Naval Academy midshipman and the brother of her close friend, Ruth Carter. She graduates from Georgia Southwestern College. She marries Jimmy at Plains Methodist Church, her childhood congregation. They would have four children: John William (“Jack”), born 1947; James Earl III (“Chip”), 1950; Donnel Jeffrey, 1952; and Amy Lynn, 1967. Rosalynn manages the Carter household while Jimmy serves in the Navy’s nuclear submarine program, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. She begins helping Jimmy in the farm warehouse; she soon “knew more on paper about the business than he did,” she recalled ahead of their 75th anniversary. She helps Jimmy campaign for state Senate, an office he would win in a contested election that was ultimately settled in court. Rosalynn begins campaigning on her own for the first time during Jimmy’s first run for Georgia governor, a race he loses. But their model of campaigning separately would be key to winning four years later and to capturing the presidency in 1976. She leads the “Peanut Brigade” of Carter family, friends and supporters from Georgia who spread out across Iowa and other key nominating states to widen the campaign’s person-to-person reach. The same model they used in Georgia revolutionizes presidential campaigning, with Rosalynn as Jimmy’s top surrogate. Rosalynn, the newly sworn-in 39th president and their family draw special attention on Inauguration Day by walking down Pennsylvania Avenue rather than riding in an armored limousine. The Carters enroll daughter Amy in a Washington, D.C., public school that is majority-Black. In Atlanta, when Carter was governor, Amy had attended private school. Rosalynn makes a 13-day diplomatic trip to seven Latin American nations and Caribbean islands. She also urges Jimmy to delay action on treaties yielding control of the Panama Canal, arguing it is too politically costly for a first term. He proceeds with the treaties. Rosalynn is with Jimmy at Camp David for much of the intense negotiations with Israel’s Menachem Begin and Egypt’s Anwar Sadat. She listens to and advises the president daily before the three leaders reach the Camp David Accords. Begin and Sadat both warm to the first lady, and Sadat becomes especially close to the Carters. Rosalynn leads a delegation to Cambodian refugee camps, bringing international media attention to the humanitarian crisis. She convinces the president to admit more refugees to the U.S. She campaigns nearly daily on Jimmy’s behalf, while he stays at the White House working to win the release of American hostages in Iran. She helps win congressional approval for the Mental Health Systems Act, dedicating more federal money to local centers for treating mental health; Republican Ronald Reagan would later reverse course as president. Jimmy Carter is denied a second term by Reagan, who wins 51.6 percent of the popular vote to 41.7 percent for Carter and 6.7 percent for independent John Anderson. The Carters co-found The Carter Center in Atlanta with a mission of resolving conflicts, protecting human rights, advocating democracy and preventing disease around the world. Rosalynn releases her memoir, “First Lady from Plains,” in which she admits to missing Washington. It is the first of her five books. She travels to New York City, where the Carters volunteer building homes for Habitat for Humanity; this would become their annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project. She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, located at her collegiate alma mater, to advocate for Americans who are unpaid caregivers. Rosalynn travels with Jimmy on a weeklong Africa tour that includes an international conference on Guinea worm eradication, perhaps The Carter Center’s most ambitious public health initiative. She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, based at The Carter Center, to help working journalists produce better reporting on the topic. She is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. She testifies before a U.S. House subcommittee, urging Congress to require that health insurance policies cover mental health treatment on par with treatment for other illness. She hosts the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy for the 32nd time. In Nashville, the Carters participate in person for the last time in their Habitat for Humanity work project; the program would continue. The Carters receive President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden at their home in Plains. The couples were friends since the 1976 campaign, when Biden, then a young lawmaker from Delaware, became the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter for president. The Carters celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary. Offering advice for a successful marriage, she says, “each (person) should have some space. That’s really important.” The Carter family announces that Jimmy is entering home hospice care. They would later say they thought he would live only days but rebounded to celebrate their 77th wedding anniversary andhis 99th birthday later in the year. The family announces that Rosalynn has dementia. The Carters make asurprise appearance in the Plains Peanut Festival parade, riding in a Secret Service vehicle with the windows down for what would be her last public appearance. The Carter family announces thatshe has entered home hospice care.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) could face thesame threat of expulsion as Rep. George Santos(R-NY) once a House ethics review drops. “I think once that Ethics complaint comes forward, he could have the same problem as Santos has,” Mc Carthy told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “I think the conference would be probably better united to be able to move forward and get this all done.” Gaetz has been under a review by the House Committee on Ethics that is thought to center around accusations including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. The committee last weekdropped a stunning reporton Santos — who is staring down a 23-count indictment — that alleged he “blatantly stole” from his campaign for personal use. Committee Chairman Michael Guest (R-Miss.) has brought up a motion to expel Santos, which the lower chamber is expected to take up once it reconvenes after Thanksgiving. Santos — who has been hit with damning revelations that he fabricated large swaths of his backstory — has denied the allegations and accused the panel of bias. Gaetz, meanwhile, has strenuously denied wrongdoing and blasted his ethics review. “I am the most investigated man in the United States Congress,” Gaetz said last month. “It seems that the Ethics Committee’s interest in me waxes and wanes based on my relationship with the speaker.” Federal prosecutors earlier this year decided not to charge the Florida firebrand following a lengthy investigation into allegations of encounters with teenage women. Back in September, he was cleared of accusations by the Federal Election Commission of using campaign funds to foot legal bills for that probe. Last month, Gaetz led a mutiny of eight Republicans who banded together with a solid bloc of Democrats to topple Mc Carthy from the House speakership. Mc Carthy has long speculated that Gaetz was motivated by the ethics probe and has alleged that the Florida congressman asked him to intervene in the review, but that he refused. Gaetz has denied that claim. The California rep also again denied accusations he shoved another foe Sunday: Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), who was among the eight Republicans that voted to oust him. Last week, Burchett accused Mc Carthy of elbowing him in the gut —in a dust-up witnessed by an NPR correspondentafter a House GOP conference meeting. “If anybody got bumped, it was not intentional. It’s just a crowded hallway, where everybody’s walking out at one time,” Mc Carthy said Sunday. Mc Carthy then clarified that he wasn’t accusing Burchett of making up the physical encounter. “If somebody got bumped because of a narrow hallway, it happens all the time. It was not intentional. I know no one got punched in the process,” he said. In addition to that spat last week, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tx.) made waves complaining about the lack of deliverables House Republicans achieved. His grumbling came in the context of the recent “laddered” stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown this past Friday that had no spending cuts attached. Mc Carthy said he wished he was in the House chambers to respond to Roy when he made that viral remark. “We cut $2 trillion. We got work requirements. We got reform to NEPA, something we haven’t done in 40 years. We stopped any IRS new agents from being hired this year and $20 billion going into the future,” Mc Carthy explained. Santos has survived expulsion efforts already, most recently one that was championed by six New York Republicans. Mc Carthy did not back the effort at the time, and a coterie of Democrats didn’t either. But an outpour of Republicans and Democrats who opposed the prior effort have since changed their tune, elevating the specter of an expulsion. Congress will need to attain a two-third majority to expel him.","Nov. 19, 2023, 3:32 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
28,NY Post,"Giants, Commanders' locker rooms without hot water after Fed Ex Field equipment failure",Christian Arnold,"Fed Ex Field is not considered one of the NFL’s most glamorous stadiums and what happened afterthe Giants defeated the Washington Commanderson Sunday won’t help that image. A mechanical issue with the stadium’s main water heater meant there was no hot water in either team’s locker room, preventing players from a hot postgame shower. The Commanders confirmed the issuein a statementto various media outlets after the game. “We had an equipment failure in the main water heater that provides hot water to the field level locker rooms,” a Commanders spokespersontold Pro Football Talkin a statement. “We can’t resolve the matter without completely shutting off the water to the stadium, which is why it couldn’t be repaired in game.” The Giants, who picked up their third win of the year on Sunday, opted to jump in an ice-cold shower after the game, which they weren’t too pleased about, according to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan. Fed Ex Field opened back in 1997 and is often criticized as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL. In fact,USA Todaycalled it the worst stadium in the league in a 2022 ranking. Questions about the playing surface have been raised in the past and there have been other issues with the facility. A pipe burstduring the first game of the 2021 season, pouring an unidentified liquid onto fans sitting beneath it. In 2022, a railing gave way and sent several fans leaning up against it falling onto the field, nearly hitting Philadelphia Eagles QB Jalen Hurts. There were no injuries, but it led Hurts to criticize the stadium and Washington organization. While the Giants were clearly unhappy about having to take a cold shower, they were surely happy to leave with a 31-19 win over the Commanders to snap their three-game losing streak. Undrafted rookie quarterback Tommy Devito went 18-for-26 for 246 yards and three touchdown passes, while the Giants defense created five turnovers which included three interceptions.

29,NY Post,Shorthanded Nets trounced by 76ers behind Joel Embiid's 32 points,Dan Martin,"The Nets and 76ers look considerably different than they did a year ago, but one thing hasn’t changed: the Nets can’t find a way to beat Philadelphia. After the Sixers won all four meetings between the two in the regular season a year ago and then swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Joel Embiid dominated again, this time in a 121-99 Nets loss at Barclays Center. The Nets were again without starters Ben Simmons (back), Cam Thomas (ankle), as well as Dennis Smith Jr. (back), as they fell to 2-7 against teams with winning records. Philadelphia, meanwhile, is adjusting to life without James Harden just fine after Harden was traded, along with P.J. Tucker, to the Clippers. Under new head coach Nick Nurse, the Sixers entered Sunday with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, behind only Boston, but had dropped two of their previous three games. Embiid, the reigning MVP — and the league’s leading scorer this year, entering with a 31.9 points per game average — has combined with emerging star, Tyrese Maxey, to keep Philadelphia dangerous. But it wasn’t just their scoring that hurt the Nets. Head coach Jacque Vaughn credited the 76ers with being more physical than his squad. “You saw it on the side-out-of-bounds, out-of-bounds underneath, or you saw it in pick-and-roll, their physicality,” Vaughn said. “Last two games, give credit to Miami and also to the Sixers of being extremely physical with us.” They didn’t plan on the Sixers being sizzling-hot from 3-point range, as they hit 9 of 16 from deep in the first half and Maxey helped Philadelphia gain control by hitting three quick 3-pointers in the third quarter. Lonnie Walker IV, who led Brooklyn with 26 points off the bench, said the Nets shouldn’t have let Maxey get such a clean look on each attempt and echoed Vaughn’s belief that they need to be more assertive on defense. “Just making our presence felt,” Walker said. “Let the [other] team feel us. … Our identity has to be defense.” The Nets trailed by 10 halfway through the first quarter, dominated early by Embiid. But the Nets got it back to a one-point game at the end of the quarter. They managed to take the lead for the first time on a Mikal Bridges bucket with 7:37 to go in the half and went up by four points later in the quarter. But just as they were victimized by a 14-0 run to close out the second quarter in Miami on Thursday, the Nets faltered late in the first half again. This time, they allowed a 15-0 run by Philadelphia at one point in the second quarter to fall behind, 56-44 and the Sixers closed the half on a 20-5 burst. Philadelphia used a 16-2 run to pull away. “They made a run at the end of the second and at the start of the third, we didn’t have that pop,’’ Nic Claxton said. “It’s hard getting down against good teams. … We’ve got to do a better job of keeping the game close.” Embiid finished with 32 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists, while Maxey added 25 points. Bridges had 16 points on 7 of 11 shooting in the first half, but took just one shot after halftime. Walker was the lone bright spot for the Nets. He’s scored at least 20 points off the bench four times this season, tied with Dallas’ Tim Hardaway Jr. for tops in the NBA. Claxton noted the amount of differences in the two teams. “It was physicality [and] they made shots,” Claxton said. “They were just too comfortable. We didn’t assert ourselves enough and make them feel us. We definitely can learn from it.” ","Nov. 19, 2023, 5:42 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

Born on Oct. 31, 1934, Shepherd also had roles in the movies “Mystic Pizza,” “Uncle Buck,” “Requiem for a Dream,” and “A Dirty Shame.” She made guest appearances on the TV shows “Ed,” “Law & Order” and “Blue Bloods.” Shepherd, who lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, “passed away peacefully very early yesterday morning,” the actor and real estate agent Tom Titone wrote Saturdayon Facebook. “I studied with Suzanne as a young actor. She saw in me what I could not yet see in myself. She introduced me to my husband,” Titone recalled. “She was the officiant to our marriage under a beautiful gazebo in Central Park with a gathering of family and friends. For this, I will always be grateful.” He added: “She was a huge presence. A BIG personality. She roared with life and at it.” Shepherd is best known for portraying the mother of Karen Hill (played by Lorraine Bracco) in 1990’s “Goodfellas” and the mother of Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco) in HBO’s “The Sopranos.” Ray Abruzzo, who played Little Carmine Lupertazzi in “The Sopranos,”remembered Shepherd on Instagram. “Sad to hear of the passing of Suzanne Shepherd.

32,NY Post,'Big Little Lies' Season 3? Nicole Kidman says it's on the way,Jack Hobbs,"The lie is about to get a whole lot bigger. Nicole Kidman teased a potential third season of the HBO show “Big Little Lies”during a Q&A sessionat the CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida. “It sort of came along at a time in my life when I had my children and I was thinking I was going to retire. And then this situation came along, where Reese Witherspoon and I were able to produce that show and create that show,” Kidman, 56, gushed on Friday. “And then all of you watched it and made it a massive success.” “I loved ‘Big Little Lies,'” she added. “We will be bringing you a third one, just FYI.” The Season 2 finale of the show aired in July 2019. Kidman, who played Celeste, starred alongside Witherspoon (Madeline), Zoe Kravitz (Bonnie), Laura Dern (Renata) and Shailene Woodley (Jane). While there has been no official comment on whether or not the show will be returning to HBO, the “Moulin Rouge” actress has repeatedly expressed her desire to film another season. “Everyone’s working. Hopefully we can collide again at one point,” Kidman said in January 2020. Her sentiment was echoed by HBO CEO Casey Bloys. “I think the thing with ‘Big Little Lies’ is you have a group of people who all really love working together but obviously they’re some of the most high-profile people working in entertainment,” Bloys said to Deadlinein November. “Reese, Nicole, Zoe, Laura, everybody is so busy. It would be great to get the band back together at some point but right now everybody is so busy and there’s no idea, where we’re all saying ‘that makes perfect sense,'” he explained. “I think it’s more of one of those ‘someday.’” Executive producer Bruna Papandrea also teased that the production team had been revisiting the series. “I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately,” Papandrea told the outlet. “I do believe a lot of people feel the way I do, which is to find a way at some point to continue.” Kravitz, 34, revealed that the cast and crew initially wanted more episodes, but the unexpected death of director and executive producer Jean-Marc Valléecaused the idea to stall. “I don’t think it is,” the “Fantastic Beasts” actress told GQ in November 2022. “We talked about doing a Season 3 a lot. Unfortunately, Jean-Marc Vallée, our incredible director, passed away this last year.” “It’s heartbreaking,” she added. “I can’t imagine going on without him. He really was the visionary for that show. Unfortunately, it’s done.” Vallée, who was known for his work on “Dallas Buyers Club” and Hulu’s “Sharp Objects,” died from a heart attack in December 2021. He was 58. Kravitz and Kidman’s co-stars would also sign on for another season. Dern, 56, told Entertainment Tonightthat she was “holding out hope” for a third season. “I mean, we would all love nothing more,” she said in October 2022. “We’re like family, just very lucky. I say, let’s hold out hope. Let’s keep asking. It might just come true.” Witherspoon would return to Monterey, California, too. “We’re always talking and texting. But Jean-Marc Vallée’s passing was really hard on us,” the “Legally Blonde” star, 47,told the Hollywood Reporterin September 2022. “He was our collaborator. He was our friend. He was our brother. So much of that series was born of his imagination and his creativity, so it is hard to imagine a future without him,” she noted at the time. “But there is certainly a deep desire for all of us to connect and create those characters again.”","Nov. 19, 2023, 8:31 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

Fire personnel responded just before 8:30 a.m. to a report of a vehicle crash at the intersection of State Highway 200 and SW 80th Street and found the white Corvette smashed “in pieces,” Marion County Fire Rescue said. The car had careened off the road and clipped a power pole before breaking apart, according to witness reports. Fire officials said that downed power lines temporarily closed the highway. The driver of the Corvette was declared a “Trauma Alert” and rushed to a local hospital. The driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Florida Highway Patrol said the cause of the crash is suspected to be street racing, the Ocala Star Banner reported. The Corvette and a silver Ford Mustang were believed to have been racing westbound on the highway when the Mustang cut off the Corvette, causing the Corvette to swerve and strike another car, troopers told the newspaper. After striking the other car, troopers said the Corvette smashed through the power pole and hit a tree. The Corvette was ripped into at least four major pieces and the driver was ejected 154 feet from the wreck. No update on the Corvette driver’s injuries was immediately available. Troopers have asked the public for help in identifying the driver of the Ford Mustang in connection with the crash. The Mustang driver was described as a White male with a neatly kept beard and two tattoos on his right forearm. He is believed to stand between 5 feet, 8 inches and 6 feet tall and weigh between 225 and 250 pounds.","Nov. 19, 2023, 5:11 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
34,NY Post,Biden needs to get real on border security to pass aid for Ukraine and keep our nation safe,Unknown,"House Speaker Mike Johnson deftly averted a federal shutdown last week byensuring the government would remain fundedthrough January — but the urgent need remains for a supplemental spending bill to bolster Ukraine and Israel and beef up US defense production. And onthatfront, President Biden needs to heed the warning of Senate GOP leader Mitch Mc Connell and quit trying to sneak in yet more Democratic domestic-spending priorities, and instead get real about border security. The border funding Biden’s requested for the supplemental would just enhance the failed approach of the last nearly three years: Call it “Wave them ineven faster.” Sorry: With the Middle East on fire, Biden needs to finally break with his party’s open-borders extremists and (at a minimum) ensure the Border Patrol can at least keep terrorists from sneaking into America via Mexico. That means not only getting serious about screening migrants at border checkpoints, but relieving the pressure so far fewer crossers can elude the Border Patrol entirely. In other words, let the “asylum seeker” lines grow however long — prioritize actual border security, not processing every comer. As it stands, some 1.5 millionknown“gotaways”have crossedsince Biden took office: illegals that US officials spotted but couldn’t stop. Atop that are nobody-knows-how-many who never got spotted at all. And inadequate screening of the 2.6 million illegals that Biden has admitted has already led to multiple individuals on the terror watch list later getting caught in the nation’s interior. Quite apart from thenational crisiscaused by the “regular” illegal migrants, this is beyond insane: Biden’s basicallyaskingfor a major terrorist strike, or a coordinated series of them, whenever the terror-masters choose. Hence Mc Connell’s warning this month: “It will be difficult to get the [supplemental spending] package across the floor in the Senate without a credible border solution.” And the Senate’s a far easier haul then the House, where some Republicans are soft even on helping Ukraine fend off Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Indeed, Speaker Johnson has already pressured Biden with House passage of an “Israel-only” supplemental spending bill— exposing Democrats’ deep divisionsover what should be a no-brainer. America’s national interests demand backing for Israeland Ukraine, as well as investments to speed up US arms production in a world turned far more belligerent since Biden took over. But real border security isalsoa top national need, and has become a political must if the president’s to get Congress to act on the rest of the package.","Nov. 19, 2023, 6:56 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
35,NY Post,'Electric heat' mandates are just another green road to New York's ruin,Unknown,"It’s only one part of New York state’s deluded drive to be “carbon neutral” by 2050, but the mandate for everyone to rely on electric heat issure-fire to send bills soaring— and unlikely to reduce emissions, too. The aim is for those now relying on oil or gas for heat to install electric heat while weatherizing buildings — but the upfront costs of that are huge, so many will opt for cheaper electric furnaces and no weatherization, guaranteeing huge monthly electric bills. And that assumes the electricity will be available, even as the state’s plans for solar- and wind-driven electric plants remain mired in their own difficulties. “The cost of installing a heat pump and weatherizing a home: $14,600 to $46,200,” warns an Empire Centeranalysis. That’ll hit especially hard in upstate rural communities, where the median household income of owner-occupied homes is the lowest in New York. And it’s far less energy-efficient to generate power far from where it’s to be used, then transmit it long distances, than to burn gas or oil right on-site. Bottom line: Evenwithuniversal heat pumps, the state would need to produce far more electricity than it does now (not to mention the load required to support universal electric vehicles). And plans for non-carbon electric generationare a mess, too, so it’ll be blackouts and no heat in winter unless New York keeps relying on oil and gas to generate power — so emissions might well wind uprising. John Howard, a former Public Service Commission chairman, warned last year that implementing the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (i.e., the Cuomo-Hochul “Green New Deal” plan) wouldcost New Yorkers “hundreds of billions” in higher energy bills— upward of $300billion. Utility bills are already rising just in the first stages; the pain will only grow every year, even as the state falls ever farther behind its targets. But Gov. Hochul and most other current office-holders expect to be safely retired before the full disaster becomes obvious.","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:12 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
36,NY Post,The Open AI fiasco shows why we must regulate artificial intelligence,Steve Petersen,"Many powerful technologies, like nuclear power and genetic engineering, are “dual-use”: They have the potential to bring great benefit, but they could also cause great harm — whether by evil intent or accident. Most agree it’s wise to regulate such technologies because pure capitalism can drive hasty expansion at the expense of safety. If leading dual-use technology Company A slows down or invests more of its resources in safety research to avoid catastrophe, trailing Company B will grab the opportunity to rush ahead, since it has less to lose (from investors’ perspective) if things go wrong. Artificial general intelligence is the most extreme dual-use technology I can imagine. It’s defined as intelligence at the human level or better on all cognitive tasks — and once we get it, it’s likely to blow way beyond our level of intelligence in a hurry. If such “superintelligence” goes right, it could cure cancer and climate change and a host of similar problems, ushering in a futuristic utopia. If we get it wrong,many sober thinkers agreeit could be an existential catastrophe for humanity. Yet AGI development is still largely unregulated, leaving the major corporations to police themselves. Theweekend’s Open AI fiascoillustrates the difficulties involved: The Chat GPT company’s unusual, not-quite-for-profit corporate structure allowed the independent and largely safety-minded board of directors toremove CEO Sam Altman, despite his popularity with investors — who are clamoring for his return. Until now, AGI corporations have policed themselves fairly well. All three major players in the AGI space — Open AI, Deep Mind and Anthropic — were formed with AIsafetyas a primary concern. Open AI’s original statement of purpose was to develop AGI “to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” Anthropic was formed by Open AI people who thought Open AI was not worriedenoughabout safety. And Deep Mind had the blessing of Jaan Tallinn, Skype founder and prominent funder of AI safety initiatives. I know there are several people at all three companies hired exactly because they aresincerelyconcerned about existential risk from AI. Founders at all three companies signed thestatementon AI risk, agreeing: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Many have since cynically assumed those industry signatures were mere ploys to create regulation friendly to the entrenched interests. This is nonsense. First, AI’s existential risk is hardly a problem the industry invented as a pretext; serious academics like Stuart Russell and Max Tegmark, with no financial stake, have been concerned about it since before those AGI corporations were glimmers in their investors’ eyes. And second, the history of each of these companies suggests they themselves genuinelywantto avoid a competitive race to the bottom when it comes to AI safety. Maddening sentiments like futurist Daniel Jeffries’ tweetillustrate the danger: “The entire AI industry would like to thank the Open AI board for giving us all a chance to catch up.” But all these companies needed serious money to do their empirical AI research, and it’s sadly rare for people to hand out big chunks of money just for the good of humanity. And so Google bought Deep Mind, Microsoft invested heavily in Open AI, and now Amazon is investing in Anthropic. Each AGI company has been leading a delicate dance between bringing the benefit of near-term, pre-AGI to people — thereby pleasing investors — and not risking existential disaster in the process. One plausible source of the schism between Altman and the board is about where to find the proper tradeoff, and the AI industry as a whole is facing this dilemma. Reasonable people can disagree about that. Having worked on “aligning” AI for about 10 years now, I ammuchmore concerned about the risks than when I started. AI alignment is one of those problems — too common in both math and philosophy — that look easy from a distance and get harder the more you dig into them. Whatever the right risk assessment is, though, I hope we can all agree investor greed should not be a thumb on this particular scale. Alas, as I write, it’s starting to look like Microsoft and other investors are pressuring Open AI to remove the voices of caution from its board. Unregulated profit-seeking should not drive AGI any more than it should drive genetic engineering, pharmaceuticals or nuclear energy. Given the way things appear to be headed, though, the corporations can no longer be trusted to police themselves; it’s past time to call in the long arm of the law.","Nov. 19, 2023, 7:46 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

Newly released dashcam and bodycamfootage from the Cobb County Police Department captured Officer Clay Musselman’s heroic actions on Oct. 13, when a speeding driver zips past him on a Georgia roadway. Musselman gives chase but is soon told by a desk sergeant to pull off and return to duty rather than pursue the vehicle. Yet, moments later the cop spots the flames. “Vehicle is fully engulfed,” he radios in. Musselman pulls over and gets out, approaching the fiery wreck while using a flashlight to look for the driver in a wooded area on the side of the road. “Incoming units, I can’t tell if there’s someone still in the vehicle or not,” the cop tells the dispatcher as he nears the wreckage. That’s when he hears the woman’s calls for help from inside the flames. “Can you get out?” he yells into the raging blaze, then radios in, “2316, they’re still in the vehicle.” Mussleman shatters the car’s window and tells the woman, “Climb out, climb out.” “I can’t,” the woman screams. “My arms broke. Help me, please. I can’t” The cop replies, “You have to, come on.” He then grabs the woman by her good arm and pulls her across the grass and away from the flames. Cobb County cops said the driver was treated for a broken arm and a hip fracture at a nearby hospital. The department said the woman had been “driving erratically” at speeds “in excess of 100 mph,” but did not release the woman’s name nor say whether she was charged for eluding the officer.","Nov. 19, 2023, 5:12 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
38,NY Post,Texas Gov. Greg Abbott endorses Donald Trump for president,Ryan King,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbottformally endorsed former President Donald Trump Sunday at an event near the Texas-Mexico border. Abbott showered Trump with praise while contending that a second term for the 77-year-old would address the nation’s growing list of woes — including the border crisis. “We need a president who is going to secure the border. We need a president who is going to restore law and order in the United States of America, not letting these criminals run ransack over the stores that you see images of almost nightly,” Abbott declared. “We need a president who is going to restore world peace, as opposed to this outbreak of warfare under Joe Biden. We need Donald J. Trump back as our President of the United States of America.” Abbott’s endorsement was teased in advance of the event. He is the latest Republican governor to back the GOP frontrunner and runs the largest red state in the nation. Texas’ primary is slated for March 5, one day after Trump heads to trial on his four-count indictment for alleged 2020 election meddling. Trump’s lawyers are seeking to move that date. Thus far at least seven out of 26 sitting GOP governors have backed Trump. Earlier this month, during the third Republican debate, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders endorsed Trump. Abbott is a three-term governor who had generated some 2024 buzz himself but ultimately declined to run. His predecessors Rick Perry and George W. Bush all ran for the presidency. Both Trump and Abbott greeted Border Patrol agents during the event in Edinburg, Texas Sunday. Trump said he would “make the governor’s job very easy” in a brief 10-minute speech alluding to immigration ails afflicting the Lone Star State. “Our country is going to hell,” Trump said. “We have some people that either they don’t care, they’re not very smart or they hate our country, and nobody really knows the answer.” Under Abbott, Texas has conducted Operation Lone Star, an operation that has moved migrants into blue strongholds such as New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Trump has a 44.5 percentage point lead over his closes GOP foe, according to thelatest Real Clear Politics aggregate.","Nov. 19, 2023, 4:53 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

43,NY Post,Travis Kelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes explains why Taylor Swift romance isn't a 'distraction',Nicki Gostin,"Patrick Mahomes sweared the frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce isn’t a “distraction.” “I don’t think it feels any different,” the Chiefs quarterback, 28,told ESPNin an interview. “People see the whole Taylor Swift and Travis [thing] and they make it a huge deal because it is a huge deal. I think it becomes a bigger deal to the fanbases than it does to the guys who are actually in the building.” Patrick, whose wife Brittany Mahomes has beenspotted out with Swift, shared that he’s “been lucky enough to meet Taylor and see how good of a person she is.” He explained that her fame is not a “distraction” because “everybody cares about being the best they can be every day,” noting that may travel to Europe during the team’s off-season to see the pop superstar in concert. Swift and Kelce werefirst linked in Septemberafter he tried and failed to give her his number after her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City, Mo., in July. Since then the “Bad Blood” singer, 33, has been spotted enthusiastically cheering on Kelce, 34, atseveral of his football games. Earlier this month, the NFL star has returned the favor by jetting to attend her Buenos Aires show where she shocked him bychanging the lyrics to “Karma.” Swift swapped the words in her hit song from “Karma is the guy on the screen” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs.” “I had no clue, well I might have had a little bit of a clue. Definitely when I heard it come out of her mouth [it] still shocked me,” Kelce confessed on his “New Heights” podcast. “I was like, ‘Oh s–t. She really just said that.’” For more Page Six you love … The pair delighted fans at the same concert whenfootage surfaced of them smooching. The football player — who had just watched the concert alongside Swift’s dad — was waiting for the “Anti-Hero” singer backstage at Estadio Monumental once the three-hour gig concluded last week.

44,NY Post,Former ‘Dancing With the Stars’ champ Bobby Bones surprises Harry Jowsey with advice for the ‘haters’: ‘Get that championship’,Desiree Murphy,"Bobby Bones knows what it’s like to make it far on “Dancing With the Stars” — despite not being the best dancer. The radio host faced intense criticism and backlash from superfans when he and his pro partner,Sharna Burgess, competed on the dance competition series in 2018. Many passionate viewers on social media expressed their anger at the dance couple for making it through week to week over what fans argued were more “deserving” and “talented” couples. And while Bones felt discouraged at times, he toughed it out and went on towin the Season 27 mirrorball trophywith Burgess,“flossing” movesand all. Now, Season 32 contestants Harry Jowsey and Rylee Arnold are facing a similar situation. Although their routines have consistently received some of the lowest scores from judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli — placing them at the bottom of the leaderboard — their loyal fans have been keeping them in the competition. They’ve already beat out stars like Lele Pons,Mira Sorvino,Barry Williamsand Jamie Lynn Spears, and aremoving into Week Ninewith Ariana Madix,Jason Mraz,Alyson Hannigan, Charity Lawsonand Xochitl Gomez. Bones, 43, told Page Six that he’s been rooting for Jowsey and Arnold, and exclusively recorded a special video message for the dance duo. We surprised the two when wecrashed their rehearsals for “Taylor Swift Night”this week. “It’s championship time, baby, let’s go! I’ve been watching, I’ve been following you, I’ve been rooting for ya,” the former mirrorball champion told the “Too Hot to Handle” star and his partner via video message. “I’m seeing you get some slack online and, yeah, welcome to the club, buddy. People hate us, ’cause they ain’t us, and they don’t work like we do.” Bones went on to explain how he, like Jowsey, “never had an ounce of dance training” before he signed on to do the show, but worked hard in rehearsals and “respected” the craft. “Keep up the good work, because that’s what it is — work. It’s not where you start, it’s where you end,” the “Bobby Bones Show” host said. “And yeah, sure, the obnoxious, loud ‘DWTS’ superfan might be anti-Harry, but the person that’s watching at home relates to Harry, just like they related to me.” He added, “Go get that championship, buddy! Good luck.” Earlier this week, Jowsey, 26, and Arnold, 18, addressed the harsh comments they’ve been seeing online while talking to us in the ballroom after “Whitney Houston Night.” “For us, there is a lot of negative comments and a lot of people [saying] stuff, but obviously, we’re still here. So there’s a lot more positive out there and people who want us to still be in this competition,” said Arnold, who’s afirst-time prothis season. “So I think we just need to hold on to those who keep wanting to see us and keep voting for us, because that’s what matters and that’s what’s going to drive us to be better and improve. And to just, like, block everyone who is saying mean things because it obviously doesn’t matter.” Jowsey echoed those sentiments, telling us he’s changed his mindset on it all in recent weeks. “I’ve been getting enjoyment now out of seeing people trying to clown us,” he shared. “I’m like, ‘OK, well, you must be so angry because we keep making it through.’ We’ve got the most amazing fan base that wants to keep us here.” Jowsey and Arnold concluded by sharing a joint message to the fans whoareon their side: “Guys, we love you, thank you so much. I can’t believe you’ve kept us here. It’s been so special. This week, we’re going to dig deep for you because we really need to stay here and make it to the end.” If the two survive elimination during “Taylor Swift Night” on Nov. 21 – in which they’re dancing a rumba and a jive – they’ll make it into the Season 32 Semi-Finals. “There’s a lot of young people that watch us, so I’m assuming some people would take some inspiration out of this string bean being able to make it this far,” Jowseytold us Friday. “But also, [for] someone as young and as sweet as Rylee … for her to be able to live out her dream, to make it that far would mean the absolute world. We’re so close and I really want to get to the finale just for her.” “Dancing With the Stars” airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC and Disney+, with new episodes streaming on Hulu the following day.

The cone-shaped Oakley Hills tree is among the finest pines on the roster. Carefully placed pinecones and frosted needles give it that straight-from-the-woods appeal. Just over four feet, this modest spruce tree was built for small spaces (hello, New York City apartments).

You can even give it a lift by placing it atop a small stool as pictured. Bring the winter wonderland into your home with this frosty forest-inspired pencil tree.

Luckily, there is a tree out there for both sides of the polarizing Christmas tree debate. This timeless spruce is made with 100% needly foliage for a fully-fledged, abundant look.

If you think the Breckenridge tree is reminiscent of the mountains, it’s because designers use molds of natural cuttings of flat needle pines to produce the most realistic artificial tree possible.

Imitation is the biggest form of flattery, and this artificial tree is no exception. The Windsor Noble Fir Slim Profile Tree is sure to stump some people. Shoppers have called it “the most realistic tree” they have ever seen. Now, for a limited time, you can snatch it up for 30% off. “The ability to change back and forth from white lights to multi-color lights is great,” one customer writes about this Color Changing Oxford Fir.

At the end of last night’s episode, host Jason Momoawrapped up the show surrounded by the cast while Weekend Updateco-anchor Colin Jostheld up a sign (as you can see above) that read, “We love you Dana and Paula.” The message was for Carvey and wife Paula Zwagerman, wholost their eldest son Dex Carveythis week from an accidental drug overdose at 32. “Last night we suffered a terrible tragedy,” Carveyshared on Xon Thursday. “Our beloved son, Dex, died of an accidental drug overdose. He was 32 years old. Dex packed a lot into those 32 years. He was extremely talented at so many things–music, art, film making; comedy–and pursued all of them passionately.” Before last night’s episode of SNL, Carvey hadposted a message to Instagram, thanking friends and fans for all the support in the wake of Dex’s passing. “This is just to say thank you,” he wrote. “My wife and I have been overwhelmed by your love, your personal stories, your compassion. We received so many beautiful messages from people who knew Dex. These touched us more than we could ever express in words.” He also mentioned that he plans to take a hiatus from work and social media. “Trying to figure out what life looks like now that we are a family of 3,” he said. “We will heal the best we can and carry on. Our darling Dex would have wanted it that way.” Carvey was a cast member of SNLfrom 1986 to 1993, scoring five consecutive Emmy nominations for his performances, which included impersonations of George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. He also played some of his own characters such as Church Lady, Hans (opposite Kevin Nealonas Franz) and Garth from the Wayne’s World sketches with Mike Myersthat later became a movie franchise. Carvey regularly reminisces about his days on the sketch comedy show on his Fly on the Wallpodcast, which he cohosts with fellow SNLalum David Spade. They have had several past and current cast members on the podcast as well as show creator Lorne Michaels.

This week’s installment of the Netflixhit was chock full of Easter eggs and strange comments about how Tasha Stoneswas on her way to nabbing that championship cake stand. Tasha, to her credit, repeatedly laughed this all off, but I couldn’t help but notice how often the Netflix reality competition show’s producers seemingly went out of their way to include these comments. Sure, Noel and Alison needed to tease all the bakers about their chances of winning, but the signs pointing straight at Tasha were too numerous to ignore. So is The Great British Baking Showtipping us off that Tasha is going to be this year’s ultimate Star Baker? Or is it all a ruse to distract us from Dan Hunter’s eventual victory lap, Matty Edgell’s dark horse win, or Josh Smalley’s extremely likely triumph? The first thing you have to remember about The Great British Baking Showis it is a television show. It is manufactured from top to bottom to deliver entertainment. That’s why the casting process doesn’t just include baking quizzes, but psychological assessments. It’s why bakers are  routinely eliminated to ratchet up the tension and drama. It’s even why it’s become more and more obvious which bakers will make it to the end of the season as early as Week 1. There are narratives that the producers of The Great British Baking Showlove to tease out and this year they might be leaning a bit too hard into lionizing sweet, lovely, talented Tasha Stones. Tasha first popped in the tent thanks to back-to-back wins in “Biscuit Week” and “Bread Week.” Even before that, however, she had already made Great British Baking Showhistory as the first deaf contestant to compete. While she’s been consistently great, there have been rumblings —even from yours truly— that Paul Hollywood might be favoring her over the other bakers. Nevertheless, there’s no doubt that she’s great with bread, fab with flavors, and one of this season’s most charming competitors. Given all that, she’s clearly a frontrunner. So why did it feel a bit much for her odds of winning the whole thing to be brought up again and again during “Party Week”? The first person to bring up Tasha’s chances of making it to the final? Not Noel Fielding nor Alison Hammond, but Paul Hollywood himself. After Tasha shared her plans to make “Cider in the Park” themed Sausage Rolls for the Signature Challenge, Paul straight up asked Tasha, “So how do you feel about the final now? Do you think you’re in reach?” Not taking the bait, Tasha politely said and signed, “Whatever happens now, I’m really proud.” “Yeah, but you definitely want to win,” Noel said with his usual cheeky aplomb. “You’re talented enough to get yourself through to the final, but it’s all about concentrating on each dish and getting it absolutely correct. So good luck,” Paul said. While we watched Noel and Alison do this same song and dance with the rest of the bakers in the Quarter-Finals, Paul’s repeated insistence that Tasha was good enough to make it into the finals felt a bit like he was, once again, playing favorites. And I probably might have overlooked this entire exchange if The Great British Baking Show‘s producers didn’t keep a very telling blooper in the episode’s final cut. During the Technical Challenge — which Tasha later won — Alison checks in on how she’s doing. “Can you believe that you’ve gotten to the semi-finals?” Alison asks before she realizes her faux pas. “Sorry, it’s not the semi-finals. Sorry. That’s a bit awkward, isn’t it?” Tasha’s eyes bulge in confusion as Alison continues. “I’m rushing this show on. That was really awkward… Can you believe you’ve won? How does it feel?” Tasha plays along like a good improv student, but it felt like such a strange mistake to keep in the final edit unless the producers wanted to tip audiences off to the fact that Tasha was their favorite to win. Between Paul’s comments and the producers’ editing choices,The Great British Baking Showis setting Tasha Stones up to win it all. This feels odd because I’d otherwise put my money on Josh Smalley taking it all. (After all, he is the Showstopper Svengali and what are the finals but non-stop Showstoppers?) Is The Great British Baking Showtipping fans off to a Tasha win? Or setting her up for a heartbreaking fall when the finale does air? There are only two more episodes of The Great British Baking Showdue on Netflix this year, so we’ll find out sooner or later if Tasha is the Bake Off Queen… This story has been shared 9,571 times.9,571 This story has been shared 3,270 times.3,270 This story has been shared 1,902 times.1,902 This story has been shared 1,682 times.1,682 This story has been shared 1,426 times.1,426 This story has been shared 1,357 times.1,357 This story has been shared 903 times.903 This story has been shared 854 times.854 This story has been shared 659 times.659 This story has been shared 641 times.641 This story has been shared 591 times.591 This story has been shared 537 times.537 This story has been shared 499 times.499 This story has been shared 362 times.362",Unknown,,,
63,NY Post,"'My equal partner'Ex-First Lady Rosalynn Carter dead at 96 after family announced dementia battle, entered hospice care with Jimmy",Patrick Reilly,"Former first lady Rosalynn Carter – the Georgia-born humanitarian, champion of mental health and wife of 39th President Jimmy Carter – died on Sunday at the age of 96. A statement from the Carter Center said that Rosalynn died peacefully at home, with her family by her side. “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” President Carter said. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.” Her family announced in May 2023 that she had been diagnosed with dementia and she later joined the former president on hospice care at their Plains home in November. President Joe Biden released a statement that said the former first lady “walked her own path, inspiring a nation and the world along the way.” “Throughout her incredible life as First Lady of Georgia and the First Lady of the United States, Rosalynn did so much to address many of society’s greatest needs,” Biden said. “She was a champion for equal rights and opportunities for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and wellness for every person; and a supporter of the often unseen and uncompensated caregivers of our children, aging loved ones, and people with disabilities.” Former President George W. Bush paid tribute to the former first lady, calling Carter a woman of dignity and strength. “There was no greater advocate of President Carter, and their partnership set a wonderful example of loyalty and fidelity. She leaves behind an important legacy in her work to destigmatize mental health. We join our fellow citizens in sending our condolences to President Carter and their family,” Bush said in a statement with former first lady Laura Bush. Gov. Kathy Hochul also sent her condolences in a post on social media Sunday afternoon. “Rosalynn Carter lived a life of service to her community and to our nation,” the fellow Democrat wrote on X. “New York joins the Carter family in mourning her loss.” Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born in the small town of Plains, Georgia — the same town as her future husband — on Aug. 18, 1927, and was the eldest of four children. When she was just 13 years old, her father died from leukemia, forcing her mother to work as a dressmaker to support her children,according to her official White House biography. Despite having to help out at home as the oldest daughter, Carter continued her studies and graduated high school and eventually from Georgia Southwestern College. She had her first date with Jimmy Carter, a longtime family friend, in 1945 while he was home from the Naval Academy in Annapolis. “She’s the girl I want to marry,” Jimmy Carter told his mother after that first outing with 17-year-old Rosalynn. They were married in 1946, and after moving around to several cities to support Jimmy’s career in the Navy, settled back in Plains after his father died in 1953 and took control of the family peanut farm, where Rosalynn managed the accounts. She helped Jimmy’s political campaigns for Georgia state Senate in 1962, his gubernatorial bid for governor in 1970 and eventually his run for the White House in 1977. As first lady, she was a strong presence in the White House — dubbed by the DC Press as “the Steel Magnolia” for her uniquely strong nature mixed with the stereotypical grace of a Southern political wife. She expanded the role of the first lady, working out of her own office in the East Wing, with her own staff, on her own initiatives. She also sat in on top-level meetings with the president’s advisers, raising eyebrows among the capital’s elite. Carter biographer Jonathan Alter told the Associated Press that Rosalynn was a silent presence at most cabinet meetings, listening intently to provide Jimmy with sound advice. She launched her own agenda to compliment her husband’s dedication to the less fortunate, including campaigning for those with disabilities, women’s rights issues and, most famously, for pushing back on society’s stigma of mental health issues. She served as the honorary chair of the President’s Commission on Mental Health, which worked to pass the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980. Alter said he considers her active role as first lady comparable to Eleanor Roosevelt and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but noted her relationship with her husband seemed less strained than the others. Rosalynn’s activism continued after she left the White House in 1981. She founded the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers in 1987, which promotes the mental health and well-being of family caregivers. She authored five books, including her 1984 auto-biography she co-wrote with her husband about their life after politics, “First Lady from Plains; Everything To Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life.” Rosalynn entered in-home hospice care at the couple’s longtime Plains home on Nov. 17, 2023, nearly nine months to the day Jimmy did after he had a series of hospital stays. The couple were “spending time with each other and their family,” their grandson Jason Carter, said in an announcement released by the Carter Center. The Carters made arare public appearance at the Plains Peanut Festivalon Sept. 23, 2023, just days before the former commander in chief’s 99th birthday. Video showed them rolling through town in the back of a black SUV. With Post wires","Nov. 19, 2023, 3:15 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
64,NY Post,Deadly dispute Florida rapper caught on security footage gunning down manager in street before being run over by car,Alex Oliveira,"A Florida rapper faces murder charges after she allegedly gunned down her manager in the middle of the street — a killing which was caught in startling security footage, according to police. Kevhani Camilla Hicks, 27, who goes by Key Vhani onstage, was filmed shooting her manager multiple times on Oct. 9 in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami after he and another man accosted her on the street. In footage obtained by NBC Miami, Hicks was seen stepping out of a white car with her manager before the two appeared to get into an argument and began hitting each other. Another man then climbed out of a rear door and joined the melee against Hicks, and the two finally threw her to the ground and pinned her there. After they relented, Hicks walked away from the pair then suddenly turned and drew a handgun from her bag and opened fire. Her manager dove to the ground a scrambled for cover behind a car, but Hicks pursued him into the street while continuing to shoot until he was left sprawled and wounded on the ground. At that moment, the second man who’d attacked Hicks jumped into their car and pulled out, ramming into her and apparently running her over. He then sped off in the car, and Hicks stood and ran down the sidewalk out of view. Responding cops found the manager with multiple gunshot wounds. He was transported to a hospital but later died. Hicks, who was hospitalized with blunt-force injuries, told police the shooting was an act of self defense and that she had feared for her life. “The defendant stated she was in fear due to the victim’s size and upon hearing the victim yell ‘I’ll kill you with one hit,'” a police report from the incident read, according to NBC Miami. A Go Fund Me set up for Hicks by an apparent family member alleged the two men in the video have “assaulted her multiple times.” The rapper was placed in custody, but is expected to be released after a judge granted her $50,000 bond and house arrest in a recent hearing. An attorney for Hicks called the incident a “clear case of self-defense.”","Nov. 19, 2023, 5:52 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
65,NY Post,Cold turkey Heavy rains and whipping winds to wreak havoc on NYC-area travelers over Thanksgiving holiday: 'Unfortunate timing',Jesse O’Neill,"The New York City area should brace for “an abundant amount of travel delays” over the Thanksgiving holiday — thanks to expected heavy rains and whipping wind gusts of up to 40 mph, forecasters said Sunday. Across-country storm system is expectedto nail the five boroughs and beyond as the evening rush begins around 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to Fox Weather meteorologist Cody Braud. “It’s unfortunate timing,” the weather expert told the Post. What is expected to begin as light rain will turn into a deluge of a total of 2 to 3 inches that lasts until the Wednesday morning commute — just in time for one of the busiest and most expensive travel times of the year, Braud said. The sheer expected volume of the rain will “definitely cause some concern,” and flash flood warnings are likely to be issued in the coming days, the forecaster warned. “I would definitely expect… heavy rain, decent wind, and I would expect an abundant amount of travel delays, either by road or air,” Braud said, as airlinesbrace for a record level of fliersthis week. “But it looks like it will finally be out of here come Wednesday midday,” the meteorologist said. Still, the nasty conditions could follow New Yorkers who are driving to New England on Wednesday, as a second low pressure system is expected to form off the coast and whip winds into a frenzy along the I-95 corridor. In that scenario, the wind would “really start to kick up,” with gusts of up to 40 mph from the Jersey Shore to the Big Apple and up to the Boston area, later Wednesday, according to Braud. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned Friday that snowfall and freezing rain could also paralyze parts of upstate. “We are preparing for the worst case scenario and warning motorists and homeowners and people now who will be traveling locally and outside the region to alter your travel plans,”said a releasefrom the Democrat’s office said. “Do not make next Wednesday be your main day to travel or else you’ll get stuck … at home not able to travel, or…on one of the roads or the New York State Thruway,” the gov’s office said. Braud predicted that any snow in the region would be ahead of the rain and that accumulation was only likely in the Adirondacks, and parts of Vermont and New Hampshire. Hochul added, “I just want to remind everybody to be vigilant. “We’re expecting freezing rain, snow accumulations, high winds – everything you would not want to see as you’re heading out for your holiday travels. But the warnings are out there, and I’m asking everyone to heed them at this time,” she said.","Nov. 19, 2023, 1:20 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
66,NY Post,Clearing the air Erin Andrews' camp speaks out on past reveal of sideline reporting embellishments,Bridget Reilly," Erin Andrews’ camp is addressing past comments of embellished sideline reporting amid the fallout of the Charissa Thompson scandal that has rocked sports media. Thompson, a Fox and Amazon Prime host, revealed this week she would make up reports during her tenure as a sideline reporter. “I’ve said this before so I haven’t been fired for saying it, so I’ll say it again … I would make up the report sometimes because a) the coach wouldn’t come out at halftime, or it was too late, and I didn’t want to screw up the report, so I was like, ‘I’m just gonna make this up,” Thompsonsaid on Barstool Sports’ “Pardon My Take” podcast. Thompson had previously admitted to doing so on the “Calm Down” podcast she co-hosts with Andrewsnearly two years ago. “I’ve done that too,” Andrews added. “For a coach that I didn’t wanna throw under the bus because he was telling me all the wrong stuff!” With Thompson having toapologize amid the backlash for her revelation, Jill Fritzo, a spokeswoman for Andrews, clarified her comments. “For her entire career, Erin Andrews has worked very closely with coaches, players and P.R. staffs to ensure accuracy in her reporting,” Fritzotold The New York Timesthis week, explaining that Andrews used information obtained earlier in her reporting and was “clear” about where her information came from when she used it on air. Notable sideline reporters Tracy Wolfson, Michele Tafoya, Laura Okmin and Molly Mc Grathexcoriated Thompsonfor making up her in-game reports, while the embattled NFL personality has received support from the likes of former host Rachel Bonnetta and Kelly Stafford, the wife of Rams QB Matt Stafford. Thompson addressed her comments in a statement made to Instagram on Friday. “Ok, let’s address the elephant in the room,”she wrote. “I have a responsibility to myself and my employers to clarify what is being reported. When on a podcast this week, I said I would make up reports early in my career when I worked as a sideline reporter before I transitioned to my current host role. “Working in media I understand how important words are and I chose the wrong words to describe the situation. I’m sorry. I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster.” ","Nov. 19, 2023, 1:31 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
67,NY Post,Going strong Naomi Biden shares video commemorating 1-year anniversary of her White House wedding,Alex Oliveira,"Naomi Biden released a lengthy wedding reel on social media Sunday in commemoration of the one-year anniversary ofher lavish White House wedding. Biden, 29, the granddaughter of 80-year-old President Joe Biden, was married a year ago today on the South Lawn of the presidential mansion — the first wedding ever held at the scenic site. Across a whopping 8 minutes and 17 seconds,the videohighlighted the opulent wedding as it progressed from inside the White House, out onto the South Lawn where Naomi was walked down the aisle byher father Hunter Biden, then back inside for a luncheon and later an evening reception. Throughout the video, Naomi twirled and hugged guests in an assortment of white dresses. She gazed out windows and smiled sheepishly while holding hands with her husband Peter Neal in 16mm footage — all while music meant to strum the heartstrings played alongside tearful toasts and speeches to the happy couple. “It is a great honor to live here, and it is an enormous, enormous debt I owe the American people,” the president said during a toast, “But it’s never quite felt like home until today.” “To love a person is to learn the song that is in their heart, and to sing it to them when they need it,” another person said in a speech. At numerous moments in the video, the bride could be seen raising her eyes from a downturned gaze, and the groom, 26, could be seen buttoning his jacket and looking over his shoulder. Together they cut their extremely tall wedding cake with the help of a stepladder in one shot, and Naomi twirled some more in others. Though shots from the 250-guest wedding have floated around in the past year, the video was one of the first extensive looks inside the event, which besides the outdoors ceremony was kept largely private by the Bidens. Breaking from traditions of the previous 18 weddings held at the White House, the Bidens locked reporters out from the event and granted access only to Voguefor a spread that focused on Naomi getting prepared and included another shot of her gazing out a window. “We always knew we’d get married in someone’s backyard,” the president’s eldest granddaughter told the magazine. The decision to lock the press out was met with criticism by some, who argued the White House was not a private residence and that the Bidens had no right to completely keep reporters out.","Nov. 19, 2023, 8:18 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
68,NY Post,So Cal horror Bartender used fire extinguisher to kill restaurant worker abandoned behind movie theater: police,Isabel Keane,"Gruesome new details have emerged in the death of a 27-year-old woman who police say wasbrutally beaten to death with a fire extinguisherbefore her body was ditched in an alleyway behind an abandoned movie theater. Dino Rojas-Moreno, 26, was charged Friday in the murder of Tatum Goodwin, whose badly beaten body was found by a construction worker on Nov. 12 near Carmelita’s restaurant in Laguna Beach where she worked. “Her body was under a chain link fence on a construction site and a sandbag had been placed on her head,” prosecutors revealed in a new court filingobtained by KTLA. Rojas-Moreno, who was arrested in Laguna Hills on Wednesday in connection to the slaying, worked as a bartender at the nearby Royal Hawaiian Fire Grill,according to the Orange County Register. Rojas-Moreno has been accused of using a fire extinguisher as a weapon in Goodwin’s killing, which he allegedly did “in the commission and attempted commission of the crime of kidnapping,” according to Friday’s filing in Orange County Superior Court. According to the filing, Rojas-Moreno first approached Goodwin in a parking lot around 1 a.m. and assaulted her near her parked car. “Rojas-Moreno then forcefully dragged her to the rear of the parking lot, down a short alley, and to a secluded area behind a movie theatre that was under construction,” prosecutors said, which is where the savage beating allegedly took place. Later that day when Rojas-Moreno failed to show up to work, he claimed he had been “jumped” by two men in Santa Ana, prosecutors said. While the two worked at restaurants in the same town, it’s unclear whether Rojas-Moreno and Goodwin knew each other. Orange County DA Todd Spitzer called the cruel killing “a travesty for the entire community.” “It is heartbreaking that a young woman with her entire future ahead of her had her life ended in such a brutal way and then discarded like her life never mattered. She mattered, and the Orange County District Attorney’s Office is committed to ensuring justice is served.” The suspect’s arrest coincided with a vigil honoring Goodwin, which was held Wednesday night in her hometown of San Clemente and was attended by hundreds of family members and friends. “The hardest part is she was alone fighting for her life,” Goodwin’s mother, Stacy Goodwin-Pitino,told KTLA.“You’re helpless. You can’t do anything.” Her grieving sister Kaylee Goodwin expressed regret that she was not with Tatum to keep her safe. “I wasn’t there to protect her,” she said through tears at the vigil. “She didn’t deserve this.” Rojas-Moreno will be arraigned on Monday. He is being held without bond.","Nov. 19, 2023, 12:22 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0
69,NY Post,"Role reversal Trump wins over Biden in NBC poll for the first time, as president's approval craters to new low",Ryan King,"Donald Trump for the first time has surpassed President Biden in a national general election poll from NBC News. The former president eked out a slim lead over his successor — 46% to 44% — and strikingly eclipsed the incumbent among younger voters, the poll released Sunday found. “In 2019, 2020, when Trump was president, he trailed [Biden in] all of [NBC’s polls],” NBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki explained on “Meet the Press.” “This is the first time in more than a dozen polls we’ve seen a result like this.” Among younger voters ages 18 to 34, Trump emerged on top 46% to 42% over Biden. For context, younger voters broke for Biden by around 26 points in the 2020 election. Only 31% of young voters approve of Biden’s job performance, down starkly from 46% in September, the poll shows. Feeding this trend appeared to be backlash over Biden’s handling of Israel-Hamas war, an issue that has splintered the Democrat Party. A staggering 70% of younger voters said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of the conflict, per the poll. Among Democrats, 51% felt that Israel has been too aggressive, while 27% believed the Jewish state’s retaliatory actions were justified, the survey showed. Overall, 40% of registered voters approved of the president’s performance in office, compared to 57% who disapproved — marking the lowest approval rating recorded by NBC for Biden during his time in the White House. Broadly speaking, only 33% of voters approved of Biden’s foreign policy, which was down 8 percentage points from September. Biden’s stewardship over the economy had 38% approval, up 1 percentage point from September. NBC is not alone in pegging Biden down against Trump in a 2024 matchup. A flurry of polls both nationally and in battleground states also had Trump beating Biden in a general election. Trump — the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — was up 1.6 percentage points in the latest Real Clear Politics aggregate of polling. A recent Stack Data Strategysurvey of 15,000 people found Trump beating Biden in the Electoral College. The election is still about a year out, slated for Nov. 5, 2024. Biden’s campaign team has been downplaying the polls. NBC also found Trump towering over his 2024 GOP rivals. He clinched 58% support, followed by Florida Gov. Ron De Santis at 18%, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley at 13%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 3%, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at 3%. The NBC poll was conducted from Nov. 10-14 among 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. It also featured a subset of 317 Republican primary voters with a 5.5 percentage point margin of error and a 311 Democratic subset with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.6 percentage points.","Nov. 19, 2023, 1:17 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

Spears also carried her latest furry friend, Snow, whom sheadopted in Augustafter estranged husband Sam Asghari tookcustody ofone of their five dogsfollowing theircontentious divorce.

The outing marked the first time fans have seen Spears out and about since thesuccessful Oct. 24 releaseof “The Woman In Me.” While Spears has been making headlines this year for a myriad of reasons — includingdancing with (prop) knivesand still loomingdivorce drama— all eyes shifted to the pop star’s heartfelt story upon the book’s release. For more Page Six you love … One of the excerpts that caught the nation’s attention was Spears’ admission togetting an abortionduring her highly publicized relationship with Justin Timberlake. “I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” Spears, 41, wrote in her memoir, explaining that Timberlake, 42, “definitely wasn’t happy” when he learned about her pregnancy. “He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young.” Continuing, Spears wrote, “I’m sure people will hate me for this, but I agreed not to have the baby. I don’t know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”  ","Nov. 19, 2023, 4:59 p.m. ET",19.0,11.0,2023.0

This year, Black Friday will take place on Nov. 24, with Cyber Monday following suit on Nov. 27. However, the New York Post anticipates plenty of brands and retailers to host promotions starting as early as Nov. 22 (“Cyber Week), with some already live — as listed in our list below. The golden question, right? While online shopping has taken over not just the post-Thanksgiving times (but has ignited year-round activity), this ask is common among consumers whose primary interest is adding the right deal to their carts — at the right time. “Traditionally, Black Friday was for brick-and-mortar stores and Cyber Monday was for e-commerce,” Christian Piller, co-founder and chief commercial officer of Pollen Returns, a retail returns pickup technology platform, told The Post. “More recently, some retailers have not opened their stores on Black Friday, so employees could spend more time with their families but offered similar deals through their websites. Now, I don’t think there’s much of a difference in-terms of deals to be had given that the majority of shopping is done online.” While it’s not Nov. 24 quite yet, a fair deal of early deals are better than we’ve ever seen (and this isn’t our first rodeo reporting on Black Friday).

74,Atlantic,Another ‘Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly’ for Elon Musk Marina Koren,Marina Koren,"The second liftoff of Starship, Space X’s giant new rocket-and-spaceship system, went beautifully this morning, the fire of the engines matching the orange glow of the sunrise in South Texas. The spaceship soared over the Gulf Coast, with all 33 engines in the rocket booster pulsing. High in the sky, the vehicles separated seamlessly—through a technique that Space X debuted during this flight—and employees let out wild cheers. The booster soon exploded, but the flight could survive that. What mattered was that Starship was still flying. It could still coast along the edge of space, and then plunge back to Earth, crashing into the Pacific Ocean off of the coast of Hawaii, as Space X planned. But then, as Space X mission control waited to hear a signal from Starship, there was only silence. Something had gone wrong after the ship shut off its engines in preparation to coast. The self-destruct system kicked in, and Starship blew itself up, according to Space X’s commentators, who were narrating the livestream. A “rapid unscheduled disassembly,” as Space Xers call it. Space X can certainly build more Starships, more rocket boosters. And the company made it further this time than at itsfirst Starship launch attemptin April, in which the spaceship and booster exploded four minutes after liftoff. But today’s explosion still counts as a setback, and it may very well delay NASA’s timeline for putting Americans back on the moon. The way Elon Musk talks about sending people to Mars, it’s easy to forget that his space company must first reach the moon. For more than 50 years, since the last Apollo astronauts stepped foot on its surface, our silvery satellite has been devoid of human visitors, but the U.S. has a plan for a triumphant return inlate 2025. And that plan hinges on Starship. Space X commentators described today’s short-lived flight as a success, just as the company did in April. And to an extent, they’re right. Space X is the most dominant rocket company in the world, and it has reached this status in part because of Musk’s hardnosed philosophy of rapid iteration—failing often and trying again. Space X has a whole shipyard of Starship prototypes, and more test flights will come, pending regulatory investigations and approval. But this failed attempt is more concerning than the previous explosion. For one thing, it comes on the heels ofa Reuters investigationthat uncovered hundreds of previously unreported injuries at Space X, which current and former employees say are a result of a rushed, disordered culture and poor safety protocols. (It also comes on the heels of wide criticism of Musk’s anti-Semitism on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, wherehateful speechhas surged since Musk took over last year.) For another, Space X’s second failure in a row threatens to throw the country’s modern-day moon shot off schedule. NASA is counting on Starship, and the clock is ticking. NASA’s current plan calls fora moon landingsometime in December 2025, the first of several visits that will transport the first woman and the first person of color to walk on the lunar surface. The space agency will launch astronauts into orbit onits own in-house rocket, but it plans to use a modified version of the Starship system, transformed into a moon lander, to carry crew to and from the lunar surface. (Space X intends to use Starship to launch more of its already ubiquitous Starlink satellites, and, of course, for future trips to Mars.) NASA officials, however, are concerned that “technical difficulties associated with” the Starship moon lander will delay the scheduled moon landing to 2026, according toa recent reportfrom NASA’s inspector general. NASA needed this second attempt to go off without a hitch, Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration-systems development,saidat a space conference last month. “We need that to be successful to get us that much further down the road.” From 1969 to 1972, our moon was not just a two-dimensional orb in the night sky, but somewhere humans actually went, to lay eyes on the cratered surface and bound effortlessly in gentle gravity. Apollo astronauts even filled outa U.S. customs formupon their return to Earth, a little hint of silliness to go along with an almost unbelievable feat. Then the Apollo program was over, and NASA moved on to the space-shuttle program and helped build the International Space Station. But once you become a spacefaring species, itseems unthinkablethat you would never go back to the moon,do more, goeven farther. For years American leaders have talked on and off about returning, and the latest effort, Artemis, named for Apollo’s twin sister in Greek mythology, is getting close to pulling it off. NASA has so far invested several billion dollars into Starship, which is much more powerful than the Saturn V rocket that launched Apollo astronauts more than 50 years ago. Officials are eager to move quickly; any significant delays are concerning because of “the space race of getting to the moon before China,” the NASA administrator Bill Nelsonsaidin a recent Washington Postinterview. “And so of course we’re counting on Space X.” Now that Starship has “disassembled,” the Federal Aviation Administration will likely open an investigation, as it did back in April, and hand Space X a list of things it must fix before the next attempt. If the past is any indication, Space X engineers will work even more intensely, and Musk will put even more pressure on them. The work won’t be over when Starship finally reaches orbit. Space X will have to prove that it can fly Starship over and over without incident before NASA agrees to put astronauts on board. Space X must also demonstrate a never-before-tested technique of fueling Starship while it floats in Earth’s orbit—using other, tanker-esque Starships—before it heads off to the moon. And Space X must practice launching those tankers into orbit too. Rocket launches always rattle the nerves, an emotional reminder of the capacity of human beings to do wild things with a little math and a lot of metal. The footage of Starship’s liftoff, before it descended into eerie silence, reminded me of a documentary about Apollo 11 released in 2019. The film is composed entirely of archival video from the 1960s, the only narration the tinny voices of newscasters, engineers, and astronauts. The footage from that first lunar landing, technically complex and perilous, is breathtaking. To watch a Starship launch is to experience a glimmer of the future of space travel, to imagine the documentary scene that will one day be made about the Starship tests that eventually led to a glorious moon landing. Someday, historians may recognize these flights as a turning point in the journey to delivering people to the moon again, and maybe even to other worlds in the solar system. We are living in archival footage now. But Space X, together with NASA, has many more scenes to complete, including that most basic one: reaching orbit in one piece.",2023-11-18T14:04:17Z,18.0,11.0,2023.0
75,Atlantic,The Women Who Saw 9/11 Coming Liza Mundy,Liza Mundy,"One day toward the end of the 20th century, John Rizzo, a career lawyer at the Central Intelligence Agency, found himself chatting with Jack Downing—a former Marine and stalwart Cold Warrior who had been brought out of retirement to oversee the clandestine service. The two men were talking about an analyst named Michael Scheuer, the cerebral but polarizing leader of a team focused on a terrorist group called al-Qaeda. Skeptical that Scheuer was up to the job, Downing brought up a perceived weakness of his staff. “The only people who work for him are girls,” he scoffed. It was a small moment, but one Rizzo never forgot. “I remember him sayinggirls,” Rizzo told me in an interview before his death in 2021. Ironically, Downing, who also died in 2021, was seen as relatively supportive of women at the CIA. Back in 2018, I met with a group of CIA historians to talk about women’s roles and experiences at the agency. The historians pointed to the striking number of women engaged in several key missions, chief among them the tracking of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, both before and after the 9/11 attacks; Scheuer’s team of “girls” played a key part. Over three years of book research, I interviewed more than one hundred female officers at the agency, including at least a half dozen who were involved in the bin Laden effort—some of whom had not spoken previously about their work, or not extensively—as well as many of their male colleagues. What became clear in these conversations was that many of the women who charted al-Qaeda’s rise felt that their work was undervalued or ignored and that their gender was part of the equation. For decades, the CIA, founded in 1947, had been a boys’ club. The agency made a practice of hiring women as clerks, record-keepers, and secretaries, but not placing them in top jobs, particularly those that involved spying. According to a series of reports conducted during the Cold War decades, the view among many officers at Langley was that women were more emotional than men, less likely to be taken seriously abroad, and unable to succeed at the vital spycraft of running agents—that is, recruiting foreign nationals to share state secrets. When the agency’s equal-opportunity office investigated a discrimination complaint brought by a female officer in the late 1970s, the resulting report found “unwitting, subliminal, unconscious discriminatory procedures which have become institutionalized by practice.” The agency settled with the complainant, but then, in the mid-1990s, found itself settling two major sex-discrimination lawsuits brought by women in the clandestine service. Sexism also existed in the analytic directorate, the large cadre of officers who take what the spies collect and make conclusions and predictions. A 1992 “glass ceiling” study commissioned by the CIA found that women made up nearly 40 percent of the professional workforce but only 10 percent of the elite Senior Intelligence Service. Women often found the headquarters environment “uncomfortable and alienating,” the study said, while white men tended to be given “career-making assignments.” This history helps explain the dismissiveness that the largely female group tracking al-Qaeda perceived. For more than a decade beginning in the mid-1980s, the emerging discipline of counterterrorism was a low-priority mission, which is one reason so many women were shunted into it. But although they were well positioned to spot the earliest signs of al-Qaeda’s rise, they often had trouble getting their voices heard when they sounded warnings. That the male analyst they were most closely associated with—Scheuer—was contentious in the building didn’t help. Not all the women were heroes; the team had flaws just as any team of men would. They did not always make themselves pleasant to colleagues or bosses. They did not always agree on the approach, methods, or level of aggression warranted toward terrorists and their leaders. After 9/11, some were as susceptible as men to the excesses of the War on Terror. But for years beforehand they endeavored to make known that a dispersed group of fighters—while lacking a formal military or high-tech weaponry—was capable of turning America’s own technology against itself, and fully intended to do so. Countless investigations have examined why the United States didn’t see 9/11 coming, and the explanations are many. But one factor these assessments don’t fully capture is that some analysts did know that such an attack could happen, and that many of the earliest, most tenacious, and most perceptive of them were female, in an institution that had long underestimated women and their work. One of the first officersto pay attention to al-Qaeda was a twentysomething analyst named Cindy Storer, sharp-eyed, good at math, a lover of puzzles. In 1989, Storer joined the desk responsible for looking at Afghanistan, which for 10 years had been occupied by Soviet invaders, with the CIA basically running the resistance. The year she arrived on that account, the Soviet Army was defeated; two years later, the Soviet Union fell. Afghanistan, for most officers, faded into unimportance. “We walked away from it,” William Webster, then the CIA director, later admitted. Storer, however, stayed on the beat, watching as tribal factions fought for control of the country. She began noticing something else: Arab fighters who had traveled from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to help repel the Soviet occupiers were now fanning out across the world. In Afghanistan, they were known as “foreign fighters” or “Afghan Arabs.” They called themselvesmujahideen: Islamic warriors pursuing jihad, or holy war, against infidel nations. They were violent, anti-Western, and growing in number. Storer began teaching herself how to do terrorism analysis, a new skill that entailed making sense of fragments such as travel records and intercepted conversations among fighters using code names. Sifting through transcripts, cables, and Arab-language news articles, she set out to track which fighters were being influenced by which people and groups. As she talked to colleagues and bosses, however, it seemed to her that they minimized the threat at a time—the “peace dividend” era—when CIA resources were shrinking and desks were competitive and short-staffed. “Nobody wanted to hear about it,” she told me. At least, not until she met with a more senior Near East and South Asia analyst, Barbara Sude. Sude was a perfect example of how women at the CIA had been funneled: She’d earned her Ph D in the mid-1970s and applied to the agency on a whim. At the time, women were mostly being hired as secretaries, and the agency had a special test with a pink cover, which included questions like: Would you rather spend time putting on makeup or go without? Upon being hired, she was routed to an offshoot unit—the Foreign Broadcast Information Service—where she worked for a decade before making her way into an analyst job at CIA headquarters. An expert in medieval Islamic thought, Sude turned her attention to political Islam and, at Storer’s suggestion, added Islamic extremists to her portfolio, including those with links to terrorism. The two analysts studied illicit financial transactions, looking at nongovernmental organizations to see which ones were diverting donations for nefarious purposes. Soon, a third woman, Gina Bennett, joined their efforts. After Bennett graduated from college in 1988, she applied to the CIA. She didn’t get an interview, so she took a job as a clerk-typist at the State Department. She was quickly promoted to the department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, known as the INR, where she worked as a junior analyst in the terrorism “watch office,” which fielded cables about explosions and threats. Months into her new job, on December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. Nearly 300 people died in a terrorist bombing attributed to Libyan agents. The killing of civilians—students, families, children—was horrific, and Bennett, like the other women, sensed a pivot: Terrorism was rising and changing form. From her desk in Foggy Bottom, she began to study the flow of foreign fighters leaving Afghanistan and going into Chechnya, Kashmir, the Philippines, surfacing in Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Burma. Bennett, pregnant with her first child, began working on a memo for the INR’s daily bulletin, a compendium of intelligence for diplomats and the national-security community. In early 1993, she was finishing a draft when her water broke. Twenty-four hours later, she underwent an emergency C-section. A few days later, the phone rang by her hospital bed; a car bomb had gone off in a parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. “Your people did this!” her supervisor exclaimed, meaning that she’d had her eye on the right target. Bennett was back to work within weeks of giving birth. Her stunningly farsighted memo “The Wandering Mujahidin: Armed and Dangerous” ran in the August 21–22, 1993, weekend edition of the INR’s bulletin. The same network of donors that had “funneled money, supplies, and manpower to supplement the Afghan mujahidin,” Bennett wrote, “is now contributing experienced fighters to militant Islamic groups worldwide.” The fighters excelled at guerrilla warfare, could travel easily, and had technological know-how. “The perception that the U.S. has an anti-Islamic foreign policy agenda raises the likelihood that U.S. interests increasingly will become targets,” she warned. At a time when the name Osama bin Laden had appeared almost nowhere in the Western press, Bennett named the man to beware of. “Among private donors to the new generation [of fighters], Usama Bin Ladin is particularly famous for his religious zeal and financial largesse,” she wrote. Having crossed paths with Sude at the CIA, Bennett invited her to join an informal interagency group studying the fighters. Sude invited Storer, and the women teamed up with a handful of officers from State, the CIA, the FBI, and the FAA, who met in borrowed offices, sharing papers, insights, and research. Storer created a slide deck that showed where the fighters were moving and used symbols to denote what they did: Establish an office. Set up a training camp. Make a bank deposit. Blow something up. Another member of the group, the State Department analyst Lyndsay Howard, invited Storer to share her insights with people higher up. Around late 1993 or early 1994, Howard went door to door to leading bureaus at State and begged colleagues to send somebody senior to Storer’s briefing. The group listened to the presentation, but when Howard followed them out, she heard two or three people walking down the corridor laughing, she told me. They seemed to think Storer was exaggerating, ginning up a new enemy to justify the CIA’s continued existence. At Langley, Storer could barely get the threat acknowledged. In February 1993, her team sent an item about the foreign fighters, authored by two colleagues, to the editors of the President’s Daily Brief, the compendium of urgent items that is presented every morning to the “First Customer” in the White House—Bill Clinton, at the time. The editors declined to include the item, Storer told me. After the WTC bomb exploded, an editor called and asked what her office knew about “Afghan Arabs,” she recalled. She suggested he read the PDB item that had been sitting in the drawer for two weeks. Eventually Storer and Sudeboth found their way to the CIA’s counterterrorist center, a niche unit created in the 1980s to respond to hijackings and attacks in the Middle East. By 1995, the agency was becoming more cognizant of the threat posed by bin Laden. A small “virtual station” was created within the center, initially to examine his financial dealings. Mike Scheuer headed the outfit—dubbed “Alec Station,” after his young son—and recruited a team of mostly women analysts. Scheuer, by his own description, was the second or third pick for that job, which was not ardently sought by ambitious colleagues who perceived that the bureaucracy, overall, still had not fully embraced the mission. The hardworking Scheuer grasped early on the magnitude of bin Laden’s success in cajoling other extremist leaders to come together in a multiethnic effort to kill Americans and drive the United States out of the Middle East. But Scheuer was also aggrieved, contemptuous of the political establishment, prone to go after his critics, and incessantly at odds with the FBI, from whom Alec Station sometimes hoarded information (and the other way around). “He was always a little nuts,” as one officer put it, “but he wasournut.” Storer and Sude each did stints working alongside Scheuer’s team, though not as part of it. “I had enormous respect for the women who worked for me,” Scheuer told me, describing them as “experts at minutiae, putting pieces of information together or thinking, ‘Hey, two months ago I read something about this,’ and they’d go back and find it. They didn’t spend much time at all around the water cooler telling war stories.” Having a female staff made it harder for Scheuer to get buy-in within the larger organization, however. Operations officers scoffed at his team. “What’s his staff? It’s all female,” the ops officer Glenn Carle is quoted observing in the journalist Peter Bergen’s book Manhunt. “It was just widely discussed at the time that it’s a bunch of chicks,” Carle continued. “So, the perspective was frankly condescending and dismissive.” Scheuer’s team was not given its own ops officers to collect information overseas, so he tapped his reports officers—a traditionally female job that entailed disseminating cables—to wheedle materials from colleagues on other desks. Another Alec Station team member, Jennifer Matthews, helped create a new field—targeting—that entailed finding terrorists where they hid. Working with her was Alfreda Bikowsky, known as Freda, who combined a steel-trap memory with a restless manner and an aggressive approach that some of the other women, including Storer, sometimes argued with. Darrell Blocker, a CIA officer who worked with Bikowsky years later and saluted her focus and competence, described her personality to me as “not warm and fuzzy.” When Bikowsky came to Alec Station in the late 1990s, as chief of operations, she set about expanding what “operations” could mean: no longer just recruiting foreign nationals to pass secrets but also “figuring out who it is that we should be looking for, who they’re connected to,” she told me. It was, she said, “manhunting.” (Bikowskylater drew controversywhen she participated in the post-9/11 “enhanced interrogation” program, working as an analyst vetting detainee assertions, and served as an architect of the agency’s efforts to defend what was condemned by many as torture.) Gina Bennett, at Scheuer’s urging, left the State Department and joined the CIA to work on the al-Qaeda mission. Over the next few years, Alec Station grew to about two dozen people, and remained 80 percent female. The women did not always get along. Those working for Scheuer, or some of them, exhibited ferocity and suspicion. Some, Storer felt, regarded outsiders, even Storer herself, as not necessarily entitled to know what they knew. Nonetheless, diving into the “troves” of files that the Alec team collected, Storer had an epiphany moment: “I’m like, holy crap, it’s a terrorist organization.” Bin Laden’s fighters weren’t a loose federation but a bureaucracy, complete with a payroll and franchises. Yet even in the counterterrorist center, colleagues on other accounts remained doubtful that scattered fighters could pose an organized threat on the level of Hezbollah or Hamas. As Storer put it, many officers regarded the terrorists as “ragheads who lived in a cave,” when in fact the leaders were “doctors and lawyers and military officers who knew their shit.” The agency’s bureaucracy presented another problem. Most of the classified reports the CIA produces are “corporate products,” which means that anyone with a stake in a memo or paper must sign onto it before it’s published. Consensus must be secured, desk by desk, and that’s especially hard when you are female, junior, and laboring in an obscure unit. Around 1997, Storer said, she set out to write a definitive paper with “everything you wanted to know about bin Laden and al-Qaeda.” The draft was 60 pages long. But she “couldn’t get other desks to agree,” she told me. A supervisor wanted her to break it into small parts, she recalled. Storer said the full version was never published. By mid-1998, Storer had long been warning colleagues that bin Laden’s organization had the ability to stage simultaneous attacks. On Friday, August 7, she turned out to be right: Major explosions occurred at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing hundreds and injuring thousands. When the attacks were conclusively linked to al-Qaeda, this was, as one operations officerlater wrote, a “profound” revelation, in that it showed that bin Laden could conduct “large-scale bombings of U.S. targets.” Gradually, the truth was working its way to the agency’s seventh floor and to CIA Director George Tenet, who tried to convey to the White House the extent of the threat. A series of plans to capture bin Laden were formed but were rejected by top officials, who worried about how precise the targeting was and the danger of putting civilians at risk. After the 1998 embassy bombings, Tenet paid a visit to Alec Station. As he wrote in his 2007 memoir, a female member approached him and, “quivering with emotion,” confronted him about one plan to apprehend bin Laden that had gotten nixed. Many CIA women later noticed the phrase and resented its implication that the women had been emotional and weak. As 2000 gave way to 2001, Storer found herself reading terrorist communications that used words like “Olympic-sized” and “Armageddon.” In October 2000, suicide bombers in Yemen blew a hole in the USS Cole, killing 17American sailors, and analysts were shocked when the outgoing Clinton administration did not retaliate. In 2001, Tenet began begging the incoming administration of George W. Bush to let the CIA mount an operation that allowed for killing bin Laden rather than capturing him. Analysts expected that another major attack could happen in the summer, and Storer felt responsibility and dread:This is going to happen on your watch. In July, Barbara Sude was tasked with writing a PDB that tackled the question everyone was wondering: Might the big attack occur on the U.S. mainland? She remembers her boss saying words to the effect of, “They are looking for a piece on bin Laden and the U.S.” From this loose instruction, Sude fashioned one of the most famous warnings in American history. She and a few other analysts had written nearly 40 warning items that year alone. She had a pile of papers two feet high on her desk, including one by the FAA about hijackings. Crafting the memo with the input of colleagues, Sude noted that bin Laden had implied in TV interviews that he wanted to follow the example of the 1993 World Trade Center bomber, Ramzi Yousef, and “bring the fighting to America.” The memo pointed out that the 1998 bombings of the embassies in East Africa, which bin Laden associates had scoped out as early as 1993, showed that al-Qaeda was patient and “not deterred by setbacks.” Al-Qaeda members “have resided in or traveled to the U.S. for years,” she wrote. Threat reporting suggested that bin Laden wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft, and the FBI had noted patterns of activity suggesting “preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.” She faxed a draft to the FBI, and sent it up to the PDB editors, who titled it “Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.” But the editors wanted more statistics from the FBI. Sude called the Bureau again and learned that it was conducting “approximately 70 full field investigations” looking into “bin Ladin–related” activity in the United States. Sude added that information to the draft. The item was put in the book on August 6, and the president was briefed. Sude would always wonder: When President Bush was told of the existence of more than 70 FBI investigations into bin Laden activities in the American homeland, did the commander in chief worry? Did he ever call the FBI director and ask him what was going on? Bush later told congressional investigators that he felt heartened to learn of so many investigations. He took it to mean that things were under control. After the August 6 PDB ran, four weeks passed before the Bush administration had its first Cabinet-level meeting about the threat posed by al-Qaeda, on September 4, 2001. The day of the attacks, the CIA staff evacuated headquarters, except for people in the counterterrorist center. The women there, who thought that a plane might be headed for Langley—and for them—felt a mixture of fear, anger, failure, resentment, and guilt. In the coming years, they worked to prevent more attacks and to track down the perpetrators, particularly bin Laden. One team member, Jennifer Matthews, died in that effort, killed alongside colleagues when a suicide bomber infiltrated the CIA base in Khost, Afghanistan. Some, like Cindy Storer and Barbara Sude, continued hunting terrorists for many years, until they retired. Gina Bennett was still at the CIA when bin Laden was found and killed on May 2, 2011, and stayed on for years after that. Freda Bikowsky, who went on to direct the “global jihad” unit, married Michael Scheuer in 2014 (she now goes by Alfreda Scheuer). Scheuer, meanwhile, was eased out of Alec Station in 1999 and left the agency in 2004, after growing more and more outspoken about the Iraq War and other issues. He went on to create a blog where he has expressed admiration for QAnon, claimed that the 2020 election was stolen, supported mob violence against Black Lives Matter protesters, and called for the killing of journalists and Democratic politicians, among other extremist views. (“He bears no resemblance to the man I knew,” Bennett told me.) That these women’s warnings—and many other warnings—were not acted on owes to many factors. With any failure as big as 9/11 comes hindsight bias and I-told-you-sos. But there’s no question that early strategic warnings, and later tactical ones, were made by women who worked in an un-prestigious, discounted unit, and who had their ears to the ground. After the attack, Tenet demanded that analysts, with their granular knowledge, be included in high-level briefings. When the hunt for bin Laden was reinvigorated nearly 10 years after 9/11, a team of targeters—strikingly female—proved key to the mission’s success. Whatever else it is, the CIA is a workplace, one with institutional biases, turf wars, bureaucracy, and, yes, sexism. When the stakes are so high, those dynamics can have history-making consequences.

76,Atlantic,The UFO Cover-Up Is Real—But It’s Not What You Think Garrett M. Graff,Garrett M. Graff,"There aren’t many secrets that John Brennan doesn’t know. He spent 25 years in the CIA, became the White House homeland-security adviser, and then returned to the CIA as its director. If a question interested him, he could’ve commanded legions of analysts, officers, surveillance networks, and tools to find the answer. Yet in a December 2020interviewwith the economist Tyler Cowen, Brennan admitted, somewhat tortuously, that he was flummoxed by the wave of recent reporting about UFOs: “Some of the phenomena we’re going to be seeing continues to be unexplained and might, in fact, be some type of phenomenon that is the result of something that we don’t yet understand and that could involve some type of activity that some might say constitutes a different form of life.” That roundabout and convoluted comment piqued my interest. Anything that puzzled Brennan was worth looking into. For the next two years, I dove into the history of the U.S. government’s involvement in UFOs as part of writing mynew book, and along the way I’ve become convinced that a cover-up is real—it’s just not the one that you think. Plenty of revelations, declassified documents, and public reports suggest active, ongoing deception. Even today, the government is surely hiding information about its knowledge and working theories about what exists in the skies above. But the cover-up that I believe exists is far more mundane than concealing intelligence that would forever alter our understanding of ourselves and our universe. There are some basic, obvious reasons why the government is withholding knowledge about what are now called “unidentified anomalous phenomena,” or UAPs. Some public UAP reports are likely the government’s secret projects, technologies, or operations. According to the CIA, test and development flights of the U-2 and the Oxcart spy planes “accounted for more than one-half of all UFO reports during the late 1950s.” The military has more secret test flights, development projects, and special craft than most people realize. (The Pentagon’s new next-generation B-21 stealth bomber just had itsfirst test flight this month.) Other reported UFO sightings are advanced technologies from foreign adversaries—such as Russia, China, and Iran—being tested against U.S. defenses. The government doesn’t want to give away what’s been detected and what hasn’t. Rare announcements from officials confirm this, such as when the Pentagon said at a congressional hearing in 2022 that what first appeared to be out-of-this-world, glowing, triangle-shaped crafts were actually just terrestrial dronesphotographedthrough night-vision lenses. Plenty of strange incidents, like amysterious swarm of objectsthat harassed Navy ships off the coast of California in 2019, indicate that there’s a lot more to say about foreign programs being tested against U.S. defenses. Perhaps certain agencies are silent on those programs because they don’t have enough information. The government is a maze of operations, classified efforts, and so-called Special Access Programs (SAPs) that make up the defense, homeland security, and intelligence world. No single entity or bureaucrat has a full understanding of what the others are doing, leading to repeated confusion about whether a UFO or UAP sighting is genuine. In 1947, after acivilian pilotreported a strange encounter in the Pacific Northwest that sparked a national fascination with “flying saucer” sightings, FBI executives became convinced that these peculiar crafts were a secret military program. A more tragic incident occurred the following year, when Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell was dispatched to pursue a UFO reported to the Kentucky State Police. He died racing after it, crashing on a farm along the Tennessee border. Military officials were perplexed:Did a UFO down a U.S. fighter pilot?The answer remained unknown until the 1950s, when the Air Force’s UFO-hunting unit, Project Blue Book, pieced together that the “UFO” Mantell chased was actually a secret Navy research balloon under development by a defense contractor—the cereal manufacturer General Mills. However, I believe the UFO cover-up is about more than state secrets. The government routinely hides information important and meaningless on all manner of subjects, regardless of whether legitimate national-security concerns are involved. Its default position is to stonewall, especially to conceal embarrassing revelations. After reading thousands of pages of government reports, I believe that the government’s uneasiness over its sheer ignorance drives its secrecy. It just doesn’t know very much. Officials are, at the end of the day, clueless about what a certain portion of UFOs and UAPs actually are, and they don’t like to say so. After all, “I don’t know” is a terribly uncomfortable response for a bureaucracy that spends more than $900 billion a year on homeland security and national defense. Decades of declassified memos, internal reports, and study projects create the sense that the government doesn’t have satisfying answers for the most perplexing sightings. In internal documents written before the Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1966, officials, who had no sense that ordinary civilians would read their work, admit that they simply lacked credible explanations. In a then-classified 1947 letter that led to the Air Force’s original effort to study these “flying saucer” reports, Lieutenant General Nathan Twining seemed as baffled as anyone,writingthat some of the reported craft “lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically, or remotely.” Project Sign, as the effort became known, looked at 273 sightings. After a year, it issued a secret report. Although many UFO sightings were either “errors of the human mind and senses” or “conventional aerial objects,” it said, it couldn’t explain all of them. Some sightings were just too weird to rule on one way or another. “Proof of non-existence is equally impossible to obtain unless a reasonable and convincing explanation is determined for each incident,” the Project Sign team wrote. Subsequent attempts to “solve” the mystery have consistently come up short. In 1953, the CIA—with its director and the head of scientific intelligence both bewildered by ongoing UFO reports—convened the Robertson Panel, a secret research group chaired by the Caltech physicist Howard P. Robertson. After hearing from experts and examining sighting reports, the panel concluded that there was“no evidence”that UFOs posed a threat to national security. But it used a sleight of hand to arrive at that conclusion: The researchers looked closely at only a small number of sightings, decided they seemed mundane, and extrapolated that the rest probably weren’t very interesting either. The Robertson Panel couldn’t explain all UFO sightings in the end—it just reckoned that, whatever they were, they weren’t threatening. Similar efforts to identify UFOs and UAPs for the past 80 years have stalled on a stubborn subset that appears truly mysterious. Usually examiners find that 5 to 20 percent of all sightings have no known explanation. Though some of that is surely a data problem—not all sightings contain enough information to solve one way or another—some really are mysteries. Many people who study UFOs end up frustrated by the government’s ignorance rather than its secrets. J. Allen Hynek, a distinguished Ohio astronomer who was involved with Project Sign and Project Blue Book, came to believe that government agencies tried to dodge questions about UFOs not because they were hiding something but because they had no actual knowledge to hide. For decades, Hynek traveled to UFO sightings around the country. He became so professionally fascinated with them that he wrote several books on the topic, coining the phrase “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and playing a bit part in the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. He was a constant presence in the government’s UFO work from the 1940s to the 1970s. Along the way, he was repeatedly frustrated by the poor answers military colleagues and higher-ups used to brush away sightings—explanations he doubted as a scientist and ones that didn’t square with witness testimonies. (Once Hynek was told by his Air Force superiors to publicly dismiss a series of high-profile UFO sightings in Michigan as “swamp gas.” The statement, which he delivered at a 1966 Detroit press conference, was widely mocked and so outraged the local congressman, a rising GOP star named Gerald Ford, that he pushed for the first congressional hearings on UFOs later that spring.) After leaving government and founding the independent Center for UFO Studies, Hynek said he doubted that there was a grand government conspiracy. “There are two kinds of cover-ups,” he explained in 1977. “You can cover up knowledge and you can cover up ignorance. I think there was much more of the latter than of the former.” After The New York Timesand Politicorevealed in 2017 that the Pentagon had a small-scale secret program studying UAP sightings and paranormal phenomena, anddocumenting bizarre encounterswith seemingly unexplainable craft, Congress pressed the Department of Defense and the intelligence community to take the subject more seriously. The newly constituted All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Officereportedin 2022 that of 366 recent UAP sightings it had collected, a little more than half seemed normal—either drones, balloons, or trash in the sky it described as “clutter.” Still, that left 171 incidents unsolved. The AARO has consistently said that it hasn’t found evidence of extraterrestrials. And the government believes that better data will show that most UAP sightings are “ordinary phenomena,” according to a comprehensive report released last month. On Halloween, AARO’s director, Sean Kirkpatrick, announced that his office had started a big push tocollect better datafrom current military personnel who have UAP encounters and from former government employees or contractors who may have had experience with the subject in the past. Many—perhaps most or nearly all—UAP sightings have conceivable explanations: classified projects, adversarial technology, sky trash. But there are almost certainly some world-changing revelations hidden among UAP reports, even if none of them turn out to be visiting aliens. Investigating them could lead to new discoveries in meteorology, astronomy, atmospheric science, and physics. Hynek’s words about the government’s cluelessness hint at a more intriguing truth: There is something—or, more likely, many things—out there, and none of us yet know what.

77,Atlantic,It’s Not That Hard to Stop Birds from Crashing into Windows Ben Goldfarb,Ben Goldfarb,"This article originally appeared in longer form inbio Graphic.Every spring, as the daylight lengthens and the weather warms, rivers of birds flow north across the Midwest. They fly high and at night, navigating via the stars and their own internal compasses: kinglets and creepers, woodpeckers and warblers, sparrows and shrikes.  They come from as far as Central America, bound for Minnesotan wetlands, Canadian boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. They migrate over towns and prairies and cornfields; they soar over the black tongue of Lake Michigan in such dense aggregations that they register on radar. Upon crossing the water, many encounter Chicago, where they alight in whatever greenery they can find—office parks and rooftop shrubs and scraggly street trees and the sparse landscaping outside apartment-complex lobbies.  And, as they linger and forage in Chicago’s urban canyons, they collide with glass.  To us humans, glass is ubiquitous and banal; to birds, it’s one of the world’s most confounding materials. A tanager or flicker flying toward a transparent window perceives only the space and objects beyond, not the invisible forcefield in its way. The reflective glass that coats many modern skyscrapers is just as dangerous, a shimmering mirror of clouds and trees. Some birds survive collisions, dazed but unharmed. Many don’t, done in by brain injuries and internal bleeding. Perone 2014 analysis, glass kills as many as 1 billion birds every year in the United States alone.   Chicago, among the largest and brightest cities within North America’s midwestern flyway, is especially lethal—both during spring migration and again in fall, when the survivors fly south. The artificial lights that glow across the Windy City present as a galaxy of false stars,confusing migrant birds that orient themselves by starlightand potentially enticing them toward the glassy buildings below. In 2019, researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology ranked Chicagothe country’s most perilous city for birds.  The city’s residents aren’t blind to the tragedy. Some architects and building managers have taken measures to protect birds, and politicians have tried to alleviate the crisis through laws and regulations. But progress has been fitful, and new glass monoliths sprout every year. Chicago thus epitomizes both the severity of the U.S.’s glass problem and the difficulty of summoning the will to redress it. “We have so much urban lighting, so much glass, it just puts all the wrong things together for birds,” Annette Prince, the director of a conservation group called the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, told me. “Chicago is the perfect storm.” One morning at the outset of spring migration, I found myself pacing Federal Plaza in downtown Chicago, waiting to join Prince as she scoured the city for birds. I shivered in the predawn damp, the sky the pearly gray of a chickadee’s wing. Everywhere around me loomed glass, geologic in its permanence and grandeur: towers of glass, spires of glass, bluffs and fins and ravines of it, a million deceptive facets of sky glittering overhead. Before long, Prince arrived—a compact, competent-looking woman in a fluorescent raincoat. She took me on a walk through the city, canvassing storefronts and alleys where birds might be lying, stunned or dead. Elsewhere in Chicago, other volunteers searched their own neighborhoods. This was the monitors’ 20th year in operation; Prince, a retired speech pathologist and avid birder, has been part of the group nearly since its inception. Each morning during spring and fall migrations, its volunteers peruse the street for victims and respond to reports that members of the public call in to a hotline. Injured birds go to the Willowbrook Wildlife Center, a sanctuary outside the city, to receive treatment and eventually be released. Dead ones go to the city’s Field Museum to enter its collection. Most mornings, the dead outnumber the living three to one. Every year, the monitors collect about 7,000 birds, doubtless a tiny fraction of the unknowable number that die every year. Some days the work is constant: One recent October morning, the monitors scooped up about 1,000 birds at Mc Cormick Place, a convention center abutting Lake Michigan whose massive glass facade makes it a particularly egregious hot spot. Prince joked that the volunteers measured their busyness in Valium gulped. “People call and say, ‘Hey, is there some kind of disease outbreak going around?’” she said wryly. “No, it’s just architectural design.”  Prince’s phone rang: a bird reported to the hotline, in a neighborhood without a monitor. We got into her car and tore off, Prince weaving through traffic with a cabbie’s reckless surety. When we arrived at the building—a preschool and hotel fronted by sheer glass—we found a female yellow-bellied sapsucker, her eyes sunken and legs gone stiff.  “Every building has its own pathology,” Prince had told me earlier. Here, it was easy to diagnose. Mirrored glass reflected a few scrawny trees outside the building, creating a faux, fatal forest: an optical illusion perfectly designed to slaughter birds. “You can see what a fun-house mirror this city is,” Prince said as she stuffed the sapsucker into a bag—a plastic one.  The sapsucker’s death was tragic both for the individual bird and for all of avian kind. Since 1970, according to one large-scale synthesis of national bird surveys, U.S. bird populations have declined by close to 30 percent, a loss of nearly 3 billion animals. The culprits are many—especially habitat loss and climate change—but glass is among the most catastrophic of direct, human-related killers,second only to cats, according to one 2015 study. Certain bird species are unusually susceptible, according to a2020 analysis, including wood thrushes, yellowthroats, black-throated blue warblers, and sapsuckers. That may be because these forest-dwelling migrants are accustomed to darting through tree-canopy gaps. For these and other vulnerable species, glass poses an unignorable threat.   Moreover, whereas cats or hawks often take out weaker or less wary animals, glass is an undiscerning predator, as apt to eliminate healthy migrants as sick ones. Our dead sapsucker was a hale breeding female who would have reared chicks this summer and likely for several to come. No longer. “What we’ve done here is killed one of the strongest members of her species,” Prince said with a disgusted shake of her head. “We’re incrementally taking away their future.” For as long as buildings have sported glass, birds have likely collided with it. In an 1832 ornithology textbook, the naturalist Thomas Nuttall related the tale of a young male hawk that, while “descending furiously and blindly upon its quarry,” smashed through a greenhouse. Miraculously, the hawk was “little stunned,” though his “wing-feathers were much torn.”  In Nuttall’s day, glass was comparatively rare: Windows tended to be small and set within brick or granite. Today it’s everywhere—particularly in Chicago, the longtime home of the mid-century architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, whose preference for vast glass facades still influences the city’s aesthetic. His purpose, he once said, was to fuse nature, humans, and structures in a “higher unity.” The virtue of glass was that it connected indoor spaces with outdoor ones. The irony is awful: We prize a material that kills birds, because it makes us feel closer to nature.  Yet even a perilous building can be made safer. One day, I took a self-guided tour of the Chicago area’s bird-friendly architecture. I started in Evanston, home of Northwestern University, which had retrofitted a couple of particularly deadly buildings in response to data from local bird monitors. Most problematic was the Kellogg Global Hub, a business-school headquarters as colossal and vitreous as an airport terminal. In 2018, Northwestern had coated part of the Kellogg’s facade with a translucent, dot-patterned film designed to make the building visible to birds. The dots, which were so faint that human passersby were unlikely to notice them, were spaced about as far apart as the width of my palm. Any wider than that, andbirds would attempt to fly between thedots, as they flit through dense twigs and leaves. (A single hawk decal on a big pane? Essentially useless.)  The film seemed to be working: Collisions at the Kellogg hub haddeclinedprecipitously, and for 20 minutes I watched red-winged blackbirds alight easily on its railings and roof. Even better, at the nearby Frances Searle Building, whose windows the university had covered with faint horizontal stripes, bird deaths dropped dramatically. Still, the projects had been neither cheap nor perfect. Retrofitting existing buildings is crucial, no doubt; Chicago isn’t about to dismantle its existing skyline for the sake of birds. But “the best solutions are the ones that are designed into the building from the beginning,” Claire Halpin, an architect who sat on the board of the Chicago Ornithological Society until her recent death, told me later.  Few architectural firms do that better than Halpin’s former employer, Studio Gang, the firm behind some of Chicago’s bird-friendliest mega-structures. I visited two of them, starting with the Aqua Tower, an 82-story monolith frilled with curvaceous balconies, as though the building has sprouted shelf fungi. The terraces lend the tower “visual noise,” warning birds that this otherwise reflective structure is in fact a solid object. The studio applied similar principles at Solstice on the Park, an apartment complex whose glass panels are angled toward the ground. The lobby’s windows are also subtly covered with dashes—a material known as “fritted” glass with markings printed on the pane rather than added retroactively. Both buildings, I noticed, incorporate enormous expanses of glass, yet they possess a visibility that other Chicago towers lack.   What’s more, avian safety doesn’t always require structural overhauls. During migration season, the FBI swaddles its Chicago headquarters in fine black mesh, off of which birds harmlessly bounce. At the Blue Cross Blue Shield tower, numerous birds used to die while trying to reach a potted ficus stationed invitingly in the lobby. Prince said that at her suggestion, the building’s managers moved the plant away from the window and the collisions virtually ceased. Chicago’s bird advocates are also attempting to influence policy and compel widespread change. In 2021, Illinois began to require new state-owned buildings to incorporate netting, screens, shutters, and other bird-friendly features. Even more promising, in 2020 Chicagopassed an ordinancemandating that new buildings limit their use of transparent and reflective glass, use patterned glass in high-risk areas, and reduce the interior lighting that can lure birds to their death. The city’s Department of Planning and Development is continuing to implement the ordinance.  This progress hasn’t been greeted with pleasure by all developers, some of whom fear that patterned glass will jack up construction costs and deter retailers from renting space. As one put itto Landscape Architecture Magazine, “There is a real big bird that this ordinance is going to kill: the biggest bird in town, the goose that laid the golden egg in real estate.”  Yet many advocates say the notion that protecting birds harms business is largely a myth.For one thing, because most bird collisions happen in the lowest hundred feet, architects don’t need to treat entire high-rises with bird-friendly glass. For another, glass represents a small portion of construction costs.In a 2022 report, Daniel Klem, an ornithologist at Muhlenberg College who’s studied window collisions since the 1970s, found that bird-safe glass adds less than four-tenths of a percent to the cost of a typical building. (An $8 million office tower, for example, would only pay an additional $30,000 or so.) Moreover, Klem argued, as pro-bird ordinances drive up demand for bird-friendly glass, glass manufacturers are likely to produce more of it and lower their prices.  “Right now, the majority of developers and architects don’t have this issue on their radar, but many are changing,” Klem told me. Years ago, he said, a magazine had branded him the “Rodney Dangerfield of ornithology,” referencing the comedian whose trademark joke was that he never got the respect he deserved. Within the past decade, however, respect for bird collisions has arrived, if belatedly. “Members of these key constituencies are joining the cause of saving more lives from windows,” Klem said. “These are innocent creatures that need our help.”",2023-11-18T13:00:00Z,18.0,11.0,2023.0
78,Atlantic,Revisiting Hidden Pasts at the National Book Awards Gal Beckerman,Gal Beckerman,"The National Book Awards, a glitzy affair otherwise known as the Oscars for book nerds, took place on Wednesday night. One overwhelming motif pulsed through nearly all of the winning books: the will of marginalized people to have their suppressed stories heard and acknowledged. The winner in the nonfiction category was Ned Blackhawk’s The Rediscovery of America, a radical retelling of history from a Native American perspective. Craig Santos Perez, an Indigenous Chamorro writer from Guam, won the poetry prize for his collectionfrom unincorporated territory [åmot]. At the end of his acceptance speech, he read a poem, “The Pacific Written Tradition,” about wanting young Indigenous people from his island to understand all the ways their history had actually been preserved despite not being taught in school: “Our ancestors tattooed their skin with defiant / scripts of intricately inked genealogy, stories / of plumage and pain.” The translated-literature prize went to Stênio Gardel, a Brazilian writer, for his novel,The Words That Remain, about an elderly gay man, illiterate for most of his life and from an impoverished area of Brazil, who finally learns to read and can piece together the story of his own youthful, illicit love affair. But the book that best demonstrated the night’s strong preference for works that deal with stifled or erased histories was Justin Torres’s Blackouts, which won the fiction award. Tope Folarin’sessay on the novel, published this week in The Atlantic, homes in on this theme. First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section: Torres’s book is a complex, multilayered work that, Folarin writes, “incorporates photographs, scripts, and other literary fragments to reclaim history.” Its plot is not so easy to convey, but at its center is a real book,Sex Variants: A Study of Homosexual Patterns, a 1941 study that predated the Kinsey Reports by several years.Sex Variantsincluded 80 case studies of gay and lesbian people; it presented their sexual lives as aberrant while, at the same time and in spite of itself, making their world more legible to outsiders. In Blackouts, the narrator comes into possession of a redacted copy of the report, and he spends the course of the novel trying to make sense of the text that remains—“little poems of illumination,” one character calls them—while slowly working to salvage the lines that were omitted. The novel is full of attempts at animating overlooked and forgotten lives—both the narrator and Juan Gay, the older man who passed the study along to him, become more visible through the anecdotes they dredge up about themselves. Folarin even describes Blackoutsas a kind of “guidebook” for communities “seeking to repossess their past.” Torres, like any novelist, might not want his book mined for lessons, but the exercise his characters engage in, of pulling on all possible historical strands—even those existing in a book that originally dehumanized their community—is instructive. One needs to search for this alternative narrative between the redactions, and possibly underneath them, sometimes pressing very close to the page to do so. This year, the National Book Awards valued exactly what Torres’s narrator attempts to do: insist on a past that was previously blocked out. What to do with this new sense of self, one bolstered by recovered history, is perhaps the next great theme for these writers and their cohort. How to resolve the collision of narratives that might result? What visions of multicultural society are possible? Can a focus on identity be confining, even as it’s liberating? Hopefully next year a few books might come along to confront this set of difficult questions. A Redacted Past Slowly Emerges Erasure, by Percival Everett Since the vaudeville era and the early days of Hollywood, ethnic minorities have defined American comedy onstage and -screen, but the publishing industry seems to prefer that writers of color present themselves as the subjects of grim generational trauma. In Erasure, Everett goes straight at this limiting convention with a bitterness so evident, the reader cannot help but laugh. The English-professor protagonist, enraged by the success of his peer Juanita Mae Jenkins’s novel We’s Lives in Da Ghettoand goaded by his agent’s complaint that his own writing is not “Black” enough, writes a book whose working title is My Pafology. He eventually changes it to Fuck. The full text of this fictional novel appears within the book, giving us both Everett’s parody of Black literature that panders to white audiences and his idea of what would happen if that parody were unleashed upon the world: First the author is ashamed, then he gets a bunch of money, and then he wins an award.Erasuresuggests that the best time to write something funny is when you’re so angry that a laser is about to shoot out of your mouth.  —Dan Brooks From our list: Nine books that will actually make you laugh 📚Shimmering Details, by Péter Nádas Why Activism Leads to So Much Bad Writing When artists turn activism or introduce politics into a work of art, it’s usually taken as something virtuous, an act of conscience on behalf of justice. But artistic and political values are not the same; in some ways they’re opposed, and mixing them can corrupt both. Politics is almost never a choice between good and evil but rather between two evils, and anyone who engages in political action will end up with dirty hands, distorting the truth if not peddling propaganda; whereas an artist has to aspire to an intellectual and emotional honesty that will drive creative work away from any political line. Art that tries to give political satisfaction is unlikely to be very good as either politics or art.",2023-11-17T17:20:00Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0

Like so many of Elon Musk’s acts of self-immolation, it happened in the space of a tweet. The incident began with a post from a conservative Jewish user who complained about anti-Semitic content on social media during the current Gaza conflict. “To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right,’” he wrote. “You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces.” A small-time white-nationalist account soon responded by attributing this anti-Semitism to minorities, and blaming it on the Jews: This exchange would have languished in obscurity had Musk notrepliedto this bigoted bromide with six words: “You have said the actual truth.” It should not need to be said, but sadly it does: Jews—a famously fractious people that includes Jared Kushner, George Soros, Bill Maher, and Noam Chomsky—do not have a shared consensus, let alone a collective conspiracy to subordinate white people through immigration policy. And even if there were a unified Jewish agenda, it would make absolutely no difference. That’s because, contrary to deranged delusions of anti-Jewish conspiracy theorists, public policy is not set by the 0.2 percent of the world population that is Jewish, but by the 99.8 percent that isn’t. All of these basic facts somehow escaped America’s most famous entrepreneur. More than an hour later, after it became clear that Musk’s missive was doing profound damage to his already dented reputation, the billionaire attempted to clean up his claims about the Jewish community’s perfidy bysayingthat he was only referring to the Anti-Defamation League—as though being anti-Semitic toward one group of Jews is somehow less objectionable. (It’s not.) In any case, the walk-back lasted five minutes. After another criticcomplainedthat it was “not fair to say or truthful to say that ‘Jewish communities’ promote dialectical hatred towards white,” Muskreplied: “You right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL.” None of this is new. It wasn’t the first time Muskechoedanti-Semitic conspiracy theories from his social-media bubble. And it wasn’t the first time heblamedanti-Semitism on Jewish actions, pinning the prejudice on its victims. After months of marinating in the most conspiratorial cesspools of his own site, Musk arrived today at his inevitable destination. But just because Musk’s affirmation of white-nationalist ideology was the unsurprising outcome of his online radicalization spiral doesn’t make it any less devastating—or dangerous. Anti-Semites believe that a minuscule Jewish minority controls the direction of the non-Jewish majority. But the truth is the opposite: The fate of the tiny Jewish community rests in the hands of non-Jewish society. Whether the anti-Jewish ideas of Muskand othersbecome the new normal is not up to Jews; it’s up to everyone else.",2023-11-16T03:52:27Z,16.0,11.0,2023.0

81,Atlantic,The Sudden Fall of Sam Altman,Ross Andersen,"Earlier this year, I asked Sam Altman whether decisions made by Open AI’s leaders might one day lead to unemployment among the masses. “Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop,” hetold me. He couldn’t have known then that his would be among the first. In ablog postreleased this afternoon, Open AI—the artificial-intelligence juggernaut for which Altman was the CEO—announced that he would be leaving, effective immediately, because, according to the statement, “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board.” The statement did not specify the nature of Altman’s alleged misrepresentations, but they must have concerned serious matters to merit such a dramatic and public rebuke. Altman did not reply to multiple texts seeking comment, but in aposton X (formerly Twitter), he said that he’d loved his time at Open AI, and that it was transformative for him “personally, and hopefully for the world a little bit.” The suddenness of this announcement, and the Icarus-like fall it represents for Altman, is difficult to overstate. In 2015, Altman convened a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood Sand Hill, in Menlo Park, California, with Elon Musk and a small group of others, at which they agreed to found Open AI. Various tech luminaries committed $1 billion to the company, including Musk, who agreed to co-chair its board with Altman. Their partnership lasted only until 2018, when Muskmade a playto become the company’s CEO, asreportedby Semafor. Altman led the resistance and, a year later, assumed the CEO title for himself. Altman was internet-famous before founding Open AI, primarily because of his role as the president of Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most prestigious start-up accelerator. But after Open AI released Chat GPT late last year, he became a global celebrity and embarked on a world tour, meeting with more than 10 heads of state. When Ijoined himfor his swing through East Asia last June, he was mobbed with selfie-seekers everywhere we went. He didn’t shy away from his new, larger-than-life image. He told me, and others, that he imagined AI bringing a new kind of society into being. He said that it would be the “greatest golden age.” Executives are on their best behavior for reporters, but in speaking with two of Altman’s then–fellow board members, Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman, I never heard anything that suggested palace intrigue or even much dissent. Just last week, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, the company’s main financial backer, appeared onstage with Altman at the company’s developer day. According to Axios, Microsoft learned about the news only aminutebefore it was announced, which was one minute earlier than employees at Open AIreportedlyfound out. It’s hard to think of an analogue to Altman’s firing; it’d be as if Bill Gates was abruptly shown the door at Microsoft in 1995. Open AI has so far stayed ahead of the pack in AI, despite a long and growing list of competitors, including start-ups and tech giants both. In part, it’s done so by remaining largely drama free. That’s over now, and the fallout goes beyond Altman. Brockman, another of the company’s co-founders,announcedto Open AI’s employees that he had resigned, “based on today’s news.” The company’s earlier statement said that he’d retained his position at the company but stepped down as its chairman. Either way, he’s out now too. Mira Murati, who was formerly the company’s CTO, has been named interim CEO. I’ve sat down with Murati twice, most recently in September, at The Atlantic Festival. Her message was, to my ear, indistinguishable from Altman’s. She told me that Open AI was pressing forward in trying to build an AI that could transcend human understanding of science. She said that it would be up to society to adapt to this new technology. But that was before Altman’s ouster. Perhaps Murati will soon articulate some new vision, or perhaps that task will fall to Altman’s permanent replacement. In the meantime, the resonant mystery, the thing that has group texts across Silicon Valley—and, indeed, the world—abuzz with speculation, is what Altman could have done to deserve all this. Was it a colorful indiscretion in his personal life? An internal power play? Did he go rogue in some way? Once we know, we’ll be able to say more about Open AI’s future, and his.",2023-11-18T00:30:09Z,18.0,11.0,2023.0
82,Atlantic,Trump Crosses a Crucial Line,Tom Nichols,"The former president, after years of espousing authoritarian beliefs, has fully embraced the language of fascism. But Americans—even those who have supported him—can still refuse to follow him deeper into darkness. First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic: The Decisive Outrage Readers ofthe Dailyknow that I am something of a stubborn pedant about words and their meanings. When I was a college professor teaching political science and international relations, I tried to make my students think very hard about using words such aswarandterrorism,which we often apply for their emotional impact without much thought—the “war” on poverty, the “war” on drugs, and, in a trifecta after 9/11, the “war on terrorism.” And so, I dug in my heels when Donald Trump’s critics described him and his followers as fascists. Authoritarians? Yes, some. Illiberal? Definitely. Butfascism, a term coined by Benito Mussolini and now commonly used to describe Italy, Germany, and other nations in the 1930s, has a distinct meaning, and denotes a form of government that is beyond undemocratic. Fascism is not mere oppression. It is a more holistic ideology that elevates the state over the individual (except for a sole leader, around whom there is a cult of personality), glorifies hypernationalism and racism, worships military power, hates liberal democracy, and wallows in nostalgia and historical grievances. It asserts that all public activity should serve the regime, and that all power must be gathered in the fist of the leader and exercised only by his party. I argued that for most of Trump’s time as a public figure, he was not a fascist but rather a wannabe caudillo, the kind of Latin American strongman who cared little about what people believed so long as they feared him and left him in power. When he would make forays into the public square, his politics were insubstantial and mostly focused on exploiting reflexive resentment and racism, such as when hecalled for the death penaltyfor the Black youths wrongly accused in the infamous Central Park–jogger case. But Trump in those days was never able to square his desperate wish to be accepted in Manhattan society with his need to play the role of an outer-borough tough guy. He was an obnoxious and racist gadfly, perhaps, but he was still a long way from fascism. As a candidate and as president, he had little in the way of a political program for the GOP beyond his exhausting narcissism. He had only two consistent issues:hatred of immigrantsandlove for foreign autocrats. Even now, his rants contain little political substance; when he veers off into actual issues, such as abortion and taxes, he does not seem to understand or care about them very much, and he willturn on a dimewhen he thinks it is to his advantage. Trump had long wanted to besomebodyin politics, but he is alsorather indolent—again, not a characteristic of previous fascists—and he did not necessarily want to be saddled with any actual responsibilities. According tosomereports, he never expected to win in 2016. But even then, in the run-up to the election, Trump’s opponents were alreadycalling hima fascist. I counseled against such usage at the time, because Trump, as a person and as a public figure, is just so obviously ridiculous; fascists, by contrast, are dangerouslyseriouspeople, and in many circumstances, their leaders have been unnervingly tough and courageous. Trump—whiny, childish,unmanly—hardly fits that bill. (A rare benefit of his disordered character is that his defensiveness and pettiness likely continue to limit the size of his personality cult.) After Trump was elected, I still warned against theindiscriminate useoffascism, because I suspected that the day might come when it would be an accurate term to describe him, and I wanted to preserve its power to shock and to alarm us. Iacknowledgedin August 2022 that Trump’s cult “stinks of fascism,” but I counseled “against rushing toward the F-word: Things are poised to get worse, and we need to know what to watch for.” The events of the past month, and especially Trump’s Veterans Day speech, confirm to me that the moment has arrived. For weeks, Trump has been ramping up his rhetoric. Early last month, he echoed the vile and obsessively germophobic language of Adolf Hitler bydescribingimmigrants as disease-ridden terrorists and psychiatric patients who are “poisoning the blood of our country.” Hisaddress in Claremont, New Hampshire, on Saturday was the usual hot mess of random thoughts, but near the end, it took a more sinister turn. (It’s almost impossible to follow, but you can try to read the full texthere.) In one passage in particular, Trump melded religious and political rhetoric to aim not at foreign nations or immigrants, but at his fellow citizens. This is when he crossed one of the last remaining lines that separated his usual authoritarian bluster from recognizable fascism: As the New York University professor Ruth Ben-Ghiatlater pointed out to The Washington Post, Trump is populating this list of imaginary villains (which she sees as a form of projection) in order “to set himself up as the deliverer of freedom. Mussolini promised freedom to his people too and then declared dictatorship.” Add the language in these speeches to all of the programmatic changes Trump and his allies have threatened to enact once he’s back in office—establishing massivedetention campsfor undocumented people,using the Justice Departmentagainst anyone who dares to run against him,purging governmentinstitutions, singling out Christianity asthe state’s preferred religion, and many other actions—and it’s hard to describe it all as generic “authoritarianism.” Trump no longer aims to be some garden-variety supremo; he is now promising to be a threat to every American heidentifies as an enemy—and that’s a lot of Americans. Unfortunately, the overuse offascist(among other charges) quickly wore out the part of the public’s eardrums that could process such words. Trump seized on this strategic error by his opponents and used it as a kind of political cover. Over the years, he has become more extreme and more dangerous, and now he waves away any additional criticism as indistinguishable from the over-the-top objections he faced when he entered politics, in 2015. Today, the mistake of early overreaction and the subsequent complacency it engendered have aided Trump in his efforts to subvert American democracy. His presence in our public life has become normalized, and he continues to be treated as just another major-party candidate by a hesitant media, an inattentive public, and terrified GOP officials. This is the path to disaster: The original fascists and other right-wing dictators of Europe succeeded by allying with scared elites in the face of public disorder and then, once they had seized the levers of government, driving those elites from power (and in many cases from existence on this planet). It is possible, I suppose, that Trump really has little idea of what he’s saying. (We’re under threat from “communists”and“Marxists”and“fascists?” Uh, okay.) But he hasreportedlyexpressed admiration of Hitler (and envy of Hitler’s gripon the Nazi military), so when the Republican front-runner uses terms likeverminand expressions likepoisoning the blood of our country, we are not required to spend a lot of time generously parsing what he may have meant. More to the point, the peoplearound Trump certainly know what he’s saying. Indeed, Trump’s limited vocabulary might not have allowed him to cough up a word likevermin. We do not know if it was in his prepared text, but when asked to clarify Trump’s remarks, his campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung,told The Washington Postthat “those who try to make that ridiculous assertion are clearly snowflakes grasping for anything because they are suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House.” What? Cheung later clarified his clarification: He meant to say their “sad, miserable existence"" instead of their “entire existence,” as if that was somehow better. If that’s not a fascist faux pas, nothing is. But here I want to caution my fellow citizens. Trump, whether from intention or stupidity or fear, has identified himself as a fascist under almost any reasonable definition of the word. But although he leads the angry and resentful GOP, he has not created a coherent, disciplined, and effective movement. (Consider his party’sentropic behaviorin Congress.) He is also constrained by circumstance: The country is not in disarray, or at war, or in an economic collapse. Although some of Trump’s most ardent voters support his blood-and-soil rhetoric, millions of others have no connection to that agenda. Some are unaware; others are in denial. And many of those voters are receptive to his message only because they have been bludgeoned by right-wing propaganda into irrationality and panic. Even many officials in the current GOP, that supine and useless husk of an institution, do not share Trump’s ambitions. I have long argued for confronting Trump’s voters with his offenses against our government and our Constitution. The contest between an aspiring fascist and a coalition of prodemocracy forces is even clearer now. But deploy the wordfascistwith care; many of our fellow Americans, despite their morally abysmal choice to support Trump, are not fascists. As for Trump, he has abandoned any democratic pretenses, and lost any benefit of the doubt about who and what he is. Related: Today’s News Dispatches Explore all of our newsletters here.

84,Atlantic,A Must-See Comedy About Miserable People Looking for Love,David Sims,"Ansa, the taciturn protagonist of Fallen Leaves, lives a rather gloomy existence. She works at a supermarket in Helsinki, Finland, stocking shelves and monotonously pricing items under a security guard’s brooding eye. She trudges home every night to a small apartment, listening to bleak radio reports about the Russia-Ukraine war just across the border. In the film’s opening scene, she microwaves a dinner she takes home from work, gives it one look, and throws it in the garbage, uneaten. Her name, literally translated from Finnish, means “trap”—as in, she’s trapped by her life. But did I mention that this film is one of the funniest, most winning comedies of the year?Fallen Leavesis the latest work from the Finnish writer and director Aki Kaurismäki, who channels his country’s dry and mordant outlook on life into quietly uproarious material. Many of his films are social satires: His 2002 masterpiece The Man Without a Pastwas a look at life among Helsinki’s homeless, while 2011’s Le Havreand 2017’s The Other Side of Hopeexamined Europe’s ongoing refugee crisis. But Kaurismäki always makes his bigger points slyly, weaving them into tragicomic tales of regular people struggling to carve out an existence—people like Ansa (played by Alma Pöysti), who indeed seems stuck even after she meets Holappa (Jussi Vatanen), another wayward soul in search of connection. Holappa is a construction worker and semi-functioning alcoholic with a disposition that seems, even by Finnish standards, quite sorrowful. He, like Ansa, is in his mid-40s, stuck living alone and doing menial work under the thumb of a grumpy boss. Wherever Helsinki’s cool nightlife might be located, both characters seem far from it—instead, they gather at a drab-looking social hall where singletons bleat karaoke to stony-faced fellow customers. I’ve long wondered if Kaurismäki is having more than a little fun with his country’s reputation as the most taciturn Nordic nation, a standing that fits amusingly alongside statistics claiming that it is one of the world’shappiest. But any time Fallen Leavesfeels like it’s edging into maudlin territory by depicting the sameness of its characters’ lives, Kaurismäki punctures the mood with a droll quip. Yes, Ansa and Holappa are clearly in need of human tenderness, but this is not some ultrarealistic presentation of social decay. While some of Kaurismäki’s other films make sharper points about Europe’s social democracies needing to extend their help to the less fortunate,Fallen Leavesis more tightly focused on this one couple, making a general entreaty for kindness in an era of isolation. Still, the inclusion of those radio broadcasts about atrocities in Ukraine, and ever-brewing tension on the Russian border, is not idle background noise. Finland recentlyjoined NATOafter decades of neutrality on the topic; Kaurismäki is clearly gauging the national mood as pessimistic in the face of the Russian state’s revived militarism.Fallen Leavesis not about characters addicted to doomscrolling on their phones, but that’s the overall texture of the atmosphere surrounding its two protagonists—an overwhelming fatalism, given the world’s turmoil, and a sense that things can’t improve. Again,Fallen Leavesis a comedy, and a consistently funny one, even if most of its laugh lines are gruffly delivered. The mood might be grim, and Ansa and Holappa might be convinced of their own inability to progress, but slowly they do, engaging in a halting romance that must weather their mutual suspicion that happiness simply can’t be around the corner. Ansa disapproves of Holappa’s drinking, while he chafes under her demands that he work toward self-improvement. But even as Kaurismäki throws obstacles in their way, there’s somehow little doubt on the viewer’s behalf that they’ll figure something out. That’s why I’d argue that Fallen Leavesis, for all its intended quietness, one of the most trenchant works about modern life to emerge in cinemas, post-pandemic. I’ve never been to Helsinki, nor am I an alcoholic construction worker, but I strongly identified with the feeling of these characters, the foreboding shroud of the modern world they’re wrapped up in, and their slight but meaningful efforts to search for something better.Fallen Leavesis 81 minutes long and light on dialogue, its third most pivotal character is a wayward dog Ansa takes into her life—yet it’s one of the best movies of the year.",2023-11-17T13:00:00Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
85,Atlantic,Don’t Cry for Jim Harbaugh,Jemele Hill,"Updated at 1:35 p.m. ET on November 17, 2023 After Michigan’s impressive 24–15 win over Penn State last weekend, the offensive coordinator, Sherrone Moore, broke down in tears as he professed his loyalty to the head coach, Jim Harbaugh, who could not be present at the game. “I fucking love you, man,” he said in a live TVinterview, choking back emotion. “I love the shit out of you, man. We did this for you.” Moore laid it on so thick, you would have thought Harbaugh was absent because of a life-threatening illness. In fact, he was serving a suspension for letting a significant alleged cheating scandal unfold right under his nose—or worse. The NCAA is investigating claims that the former Michigan staffer Connor Stalions concocted aschemeto surveil and sometimes film opposing coaches’ signals, in violation of NCAA rules. Last week, while the NCAA investigation was ongoing, the Big Ten, Michigan’s athletic conference, imposed a punishment of its own, suspending Harbaugh for three games. Yesterday, the schoolannouncedthat Harbaugh would stop fighting the suspension. This was surprising, because the coach and the school had until then struck a defiant tone. Michiganrespondedto the Big Ten punishment by filing a temporary restraining order. Harbaugh seemed eager to appear in court. “I’m just looking forward to that opportunity—due process,”Harbaugh told reporters. “I’m not looking for special treatment, not looking for a popularity contest, just looking for the merit of what the case is.” But a popularity contest is precisely what Harbaugh and the Wolverines seem to have been trying to win since the cheating allegations emerged. They have worked hard to create the public perception that their program is being unfairly targeted, making it seem as if there is a grand conspiracy to derail the Wolverines’ undefeated season and their realistic bid for a national championship. It’s a response that seemspulledfrom the world of politics: Never admit fault. No accusation has merit. Everything is a witch hunt. Of course, Harbaugh has the right to defend himself. He has denied having any knowledge that his staffer did anything unethical, and so far no evidence has suggested otherwise. The program suspended Stalions as soon as the allegations emerged. One of the major differences between professional and college football, however, is that in the college game, the coach has control over—and is ultimately culpable for—whatever happens inside the program. And it’s hard to extend the benefit of the doubt indefinitely when this isn’t even Harbaugh’s first suspension of the season. Michiganimposeda different three-game penalty on Harbaugh at the beginning of the season, which was apparently the university’s way of getting ahead of a looming NCAA punishment that could be even worse. The NCAA hasaccused Harbaugh of impermissible recruiting during the COVID-19 dead period and, more significantly, oflyingabout it to investigators, a charge Harbaugh hasdenied. None of these allegations has been proven, but in each case the wounds appear to be primarily self-inflicted. That hasn’t stopped Harbaugh and the Wolverines from behaving as if they’re being unjustly put in front of a firing squad. According to Sports Illustrated, Michigan’s Board of Regentsdiscussedleaving the Big Ten if the conference punished Harbaugh without due process—as if the conference has any earthly reason not to want a powerhouse such as Michigan to be successful. Sure, there’s an argument that the Big Ten should have waited until the NCAA completed its sign-stealing investigation before suspending Harbaugh, but this isn’t a court of law. The Big Ten is within its rights to protect the integrity of its conference based on its reading of the evidence. Harbaugh is far from the first coach to use an “us versus them” narrative to get the most from their players. But in light of the allegations, it’s embarrassing to see his teamwearing Michigan vs. Everybody T-shirts and to hear Harbaughtheorizethat America should be rooting for the Wolverines because “America loves a team that beats the odds and adversity and overcomes what the naysayers, critics, and so-called experts think.” Are those new code words for a coach breaking the rules, possibly misleading the NCAA, and having someone on his staff who decided to do a remix of the New England Patriots’ Spygate scandal? America may love an underdog, but, at least when it comes to sports, it doesn’t exactly embrace people who violate the spirit of competition. Ask Lance Armstrong or the Houston Astros. Although teams often cast themselves as the victim amid these kinds of controversies, that doesn’t make them look any less foolish. I’m sure some Michigan fans will accuse me of bias, and bitterness, because my alma mater, Michigan State, is currently in the midst of a terrible season that included being blown out by Michigan, 49–0. In fact, I think our lousy on-field performance may have saved us from more serious failings. Our former coach Mel Tucker wasfiredearly in the season for alleged sexual misconduct. (His attorneys have called the firing “unjustified,” and Tucker is appealing the university’s decision.) If the Spartans had been championship contenders this year, like Michigan, I don’t doubt that some fans and administrators would have rallied to Tucker’s defense. Michigan and the Big Ten were scheduled to appear in court today to determine the fate of the requested restraining order. Instead, we got the surprise news that the legal challenge was dropped. Does this mean the Wolverines will cease trying to convince people they’re the real underdogs? We should find out soon. When Michigan takes the field against Maryland tomorrow, Harbaugh will once again be watching from afar, and his assistant, Moore, will once again be filling in. Let’s hope he spares us the waterworks this time. Because if the team continues to insist that it’s “us against the world,” it will discover that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. This article originally misstated the score of the most recent game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. The University of Michigan won 49–0, not 29–7.",2023-11-17T17:25:00Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
86,Atlantic,The Director Tackling the Dark Side of Millennial Desire,Sophie Gilbert,"Before Barbie, the most subversively pink product to combust its way through Hollywood of late was Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young Woman, a pastel-hued rape-revenge thriller with a sting in its tail. Fennell loves to manipulate cinematic tropes into discomfiting shapes. Her debut feature, which starred Carey Mulligan as a med-school dropout on a mission to ensnare predatory men, layered jagged themes—trauma, violence, female rage—with beguiling, poppy visuals.Promising Young Woman, while alarming some critics, was widely praised as a fascinating excavation of rape culture. And yet, by winking in the film at well-known touchstones of the aughts, Fennell seemed to be doing something else too: digging into recent history until she found the rotten foundations underneath. The movie debuted at Sundance in January 2020. Over the course of about 18 months, Fennell went into lockdown with her baby, embarked on a vigorous press campaign conducted almost entirely over Zoom, became the first British woman to be nominated for a directing Oscar, got pregnant with her second child, and then won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the stilted, socially distanced 2021 ceremony in Los Angeles. None of it felt quite real. Her experience of the film’s success was mediated mostly through screens. Like many other people, she sought out creative outlets in isolation; rather than baking banana bread or learning to needlepoint, though, she art-directed and photographed herself in a Valley of the Dolls–styleshoot for Wmagazine, playing a character who was part Factory girl, part murderous fembot. After the movie’s release, Fennell started receiving offers, enticing ones, from “people you’ve wanted to work with your whole life,” she told me over coffee at a hotel in London earlier this fall. But the pandemic, and being at home, allowed her to avoid what she saw as distracting temptations. Instead, she quietly finished writing her second project, the new country-house thriller Saltburn. At first watch, I couldn’t quite trace a path from Promising Young Woman, a movie that hews so closely to the female experience that it stayed lodged in my brain for weeks after, to Saltburn, a Gothic, morbidly funny film that technically failsthe Bechdel Test. Having preoccupied herself for much of her career with stories about women—the second season of Killing Eve, for which she served as showrunner; her novel Monsters; and a sizable number of projects that never made it off the page—Fennell wanted to do something different. Both films share Fennell’s tendency to contrast the grand with the intimate—formal, meticulously arranged tableaus followed by shots so close up that you can almost smell them. She also makes a case for herself as an auteur firmly rooted in Millennial culture: an artist whose aesthetic feels as informed by the bubblegum, color-drenched landscapes of Sweet Valley Highand She’s All Thatas by erudite directorial idols such as Catherine Breillat and Peter Greenaway. Both movies, she said, “share a preoccupation with genre, and how you can abuse it, squeeze it out.” With Promising Young Woman, Fennell juxtaposed its rape-revenge plot with Britney Spears’s “Toxic” and a supporting cast ripped from The O.C.,Friday Night Lights, and Veronica Mars. With Saltburn, which is set in England around 2006, she wanted to replicate that era just a beat before it becomes cool and nostalgic again. The movie follows Oliver (played by Barry Keoghan), a northern-English first-year student at Oxford who becomes infatuated with Felix (Jacob Elordi), the dazzling, frivolous heir to an aristocratic family whose stately home gives the film its title. Fennell has long been fascinated by outsider narratives such as Brideshead Revisitedand Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley novels, and she’s drawn in particular to the yearning at their core—a kind of want so intense that it can easily turn dangerous. “When you look at online trolls, so much of the root of that is desire,” Fennell said. “So much of it is a furious kind of weird death-love … the fetishy relationship that we have with the things that we want, and then the way we immediately deflect that into disgust.”Saltburn’s exploration of that psychology seems pulled directly from classic 20th-century novels—Oliver is a character who could fit into virtually any historical moment—even as its visual preoccupation with the aughts alludes to that decade’s powerful influence on our understanding of intimacy and longing. In person, Fennell is a mix of beguiling, patrician charisma (she played Camilla Parker Bowles in Seasons 3 and 4 of The Crown) and cheerful deviance. Toward the end of our meeting, she leaned forward, lowered her voice slightly, and offered to tell me the best way to kill my husband; a few minutes earlier, she’d apologized for making a gesture that she thought made her look like she was acting out the “I’m a Little Teapot” nursery rhyme. In her 2015 novel,Monsters, which she wrote between seasons of playing Nurse Patsy in the BBC show Call the Midwife, Fennell describes a body that washes ashore as being “like a chicken leg that had been stewed too long”; each time the locals tried to collect it, “a piece of sodden flesh slid off the bone.” On the page, her mordant sensibility can be unnerving, but on film, paired with her precise eye for both painterly staging and aughts-era ugliness—she insisted, to the dismay of Saltburn’s male producers, that Felix have an eyebrow piercing—it entices as much as it appalls. (After a screening I went to, a woman outside shook her head and blurted out, “Dark as fuck!” to no one in particular.) When she was working on the script for Saltburn, Fennell toyed with the idea of setting it on a moneyed American campus—less Brideshead,more The Secret History. She concluded that the story would be stronger the better she knew it, and that the particular intricacies of the English class system were more loaded. “The thing about these worlds is that they’re so tricksy, so designed,” she said. The rules “are constantly shifting, constantly different from place to place.” A particularly poignant moment in the movie sees Oliver, invited to spend the summer at Felix’s ancestral home, show up at the iron-wrought gates with a wheelie suitcase, a tiny figure facing an impenetrable fortress of accreted privilege. At breakfast, he humiliates himself by not knowing the right way to ask for eggs. Fennell grew up in London; her father is the jeweler Theo Fennell, and her mother is a writer whose instincts, Fennell has said, are even darker than hers. Fennell started acting as a way to get out of organized sports at school, and was spotted by an agent in a play when she was at Oxford. Her family is eminently well connected: The actor Richard E. Grant, who plays Sir James Catton, the patriarch of Saltburn, is a family friend, as is the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who commissioned Fennell to write the book for a musical adaptation of Cinderellathat premiered in 2021. Fennell’s web of family ties is part of what makes Saltburn’s theory of privilege so intriguing. If she is on a particular side, shall we say, it isn’t the Cattons’. “It was really important to me,” she said, “that if this is a vampire story, they’re the vampires.” Fennell admits she could draw “a pretty clear line from my own personality to Elspeth,” Felix’s theatrical mother (Rosamund Pike), who has a phobic aversion to unattractiveness and paraphrases her daughter’s eating disorder as “fingers for pudding.”Saltburn, like the Jordan Peele film Get Out, is a horror story in which the monster is sociological; it’s been inside us all along. Keoghan’s unsettling performance, which switches modes constantly, is indelible, Fennell thinks, because he’s fully animal in an otherwise bloodless, highly artificial world. Elordi’s Felix, by contrast, is a character more like the genial-seeming bros in Promising Young Woman: as handsome as he is weak. In one scene at Oxford, he picks a conquest at random and then, in Fennell’s description, “takes her away with a slap on the arse without even speaking to her or looking at her.” She wanted Felix’s character to make people think about “the limits of the lies when it comes to seduction,” and how most men, rather than being heroes or villains, tend to be likable guys “who can’t quite be good enough” when they’re required to be. In real life, Fennell has been in a relationship with her husband, the producer Chris Vernon, for almost 20 years, allowing her an emotional continuity and stability that free up her imagination: “I was always with him, which meant that so much of my brain wasn’t, I don’t know, fretting. It does give you so much time to devote to the other world. Because really the only thing that keeps me sane is being in the other world.” When Promising Young Womancame out, Fennell was feted for having directed it while heavily pregnant, an experience that she said was a breeze compared to shooting Saltburnwith two young children. Most of the movie was filmed in Northamptonshire, on location. “And so I rented a house five minutes away, and was like, ‘It’s amazing, I can get the kids to bed every night,’” she said. “And then, of course, what it meant was that I had to put the kids to bed every night.” She’d wake up at five in the morning, go straight to set, come home for bathtime: “It was just a new kind of exhaustion. I think I’ve been running on adrenaline for five years now.” Even more challenging than those logistics was what she described as the “Gothic intensity” of motherhood, its lacerating vulnerability. (She had a cameo in Barbieas Midge, the discontinued pregnant doll with a detachable belly.) “The world’s way of dealing with it is to pretend it’s this nice thing,” Fennell said. “Everything’s soft. Everything’s pink. And it’s so fucking hard-core. It’s death metal.” This same specific tension—between visual sumptuousness and narrative brutality—undergirds her filmmaking style. Her creative landscape is as macabre as that of David Lynch or Breillat, the French filmmaker whose 1999 movie,Romance, helped kick off an art-house obsession with extreme sex and violence. (Fennell thought a lot, during Saltburn, about Breillat’s belief that sex is a dance between beauty and revulsion.) Fennell’s work is also governed, though, by the sense memories of being alive in the ’90s and 2000s: the way shefeltwhen she saw Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, the particular clickety-clack of the cheap accessories that she has Felix’s haughty sister, Venetia, wear in Saltburn,to make her less intimidating. For the Oxford scenes, Fennell wanted armpit hair, sweat, and visible pores, as well as Livestrong wristbands, Bic lighters, and hot-pink velour Juicy Couture sweatpants. The plasticized sparkle makes the language, the interplay among the characters, only more loaded. The themes and formulaic conventions Fennell works with might be familiar, but the vibes she evokes seem intended to hook us more intimately into her toxic world, one gleaming detail or evocative needle drop at a time.",2023-11-17T14:00:00Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
87,Atlantic,Hospitals Have Gotten Too Nice,Elisabeth Rosenthal," The last time I stepped on a plane for vacation, for fun, was more than three years ago. I haven’t been able to visit California, whose coast I adore. Nor Rome, where my husband and I lived for some time.  And yet, I’m told, I’ve been on a journey. Two journeys, actually: First, a “traumatic-brain-injury journey,” experienced at Johns Hopkins Hospital  after I banged my head and developed trouble with my balance and gait. More recently, I’ve been a traveling companion on my husband’s “cancer journey” at Memorial Sloan Kettering, in New York City.  These are two of the highest-ranked hospitals in the country. The care was excellent in both places. But neither of these journeys resembled our bike ride in Ireland or the wine-tasting trip in Sonoma a few years before.  So much of being seriously ill has been rebranded in American health care as a kind of adventure. Experts speak ofstroke journeys. Hospital systems invite people onkidney-transplantjourneys. The language has trickled down into advertising: Take ahair-lossjourney or a weight-loss journey (newly popular thanks to Wegovy and similar drugs). Theheart-failure journeyeven comes with a map.  A map? But on these journeys, you don’t get to go anywhere—except maybe the hospital or doctor’s office, which is likely, too, to have bought into the travel concept. In the past two decades, American hospitals have gotten into the business of hotel-like hospitality (illness can be fun!) rather than confine themselves to the business of disease (what a downer). And although the care might stay solid, the focus on luxurious amenities and the fancy new buildings that house them is one of the factors that have helped send costs for patients soaring that much higher, to prices well above those in other developed countries. In this version of health care, I’m no longer a patient. I’m a client, a customer, or (worse) a guest, no matter that I didn’t choose this journey cum illness. I appreciate a little luxury and privacy as much as the next person. But, at a time when Americans’ life spans are getting shorter andfour in 10adults say they’ve delayed or gone without necessary care because of cost, is it worth it?  In recent years, tight budgets, staffing shortages, and burnout have hit American hospitals. At the same time, many health centers in the U.S.—including the most prestigious ones, and even some community hospitals—have morphed into seven-star hotels. New hospital buildings, such as recent projects at the University of Michigan Medical Centerand Valley Hospital in Paramus, New Jersey, offer all-private rooms, in many cases with couches and flatscreen TVs. A hospital might now boast about its views, high-thread-count sheets, or food providedby a Michelin-starredchef.  Those commissioning and designing these pavilionscite researchshowing that private rooms are better for healing, because they offer a better chance at sleep and a lower chance of infection. (Actually, theevidence is pretty murky.)  But we’re suckers for this type of thing, andthe industry knowsthat even small comforts can make us feel better, regardless of whether we’re actually getting better. Back in 2008, researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that a hospital investing in amenities would increase demand by 38 percent, whereas a similar investment in clinical quality would lead to only a 13 percent increase. More recently,hospital executives told The Boston Globethat themain reasonhospitals have moved in this direction is that “people’s expectations have changed,” and it creates a “competitive advantage” that can be marketed to potential customers. And so the Mayo Clinic now offerscomplimentary conciergeservices, which can help with recommending nearby restaurants and finding pet care. I think that’s the hospitality version of what used to be called the hospital “help desk,” whose function was merely to explain to visitors how to get to patient rooms. Cleveland Clinic, which employs a team of curators, owns one of the largestcontemporary-art collectionsin the region, and its leaders see that collection as one tool for “positively affecting patient outcomes.” Patients at Cedars-Sinai can experience its “therapeutic art collection”of Chagalls, Picassos, and Oldenburgs.  Hospital food has gotten so goodthatin some areas people go to their localhospital forhaute cuisinerather than medical needs. And when you look at the numbers on your hospital bill, remember that all of this adds up. For the amount that American patients (or their insurers) pay for some luxury hospital journeys, they could sign up for a Virgin Galactic suborbital joy ride. This transformation from hospital to hospitality has filled up hospital C-suites withchief experience officers, whosefunction isto “manage patients’ experiences throughout their healthcare journey,” as described by the publication Health Tech. The Cleveland Clinic was the first major academic medical center to add one, back in 2007; now some health systems hire for this and similar positions directly from the hospitality industry, picking people who’d previously been managers at a Ritz-Carlton or a Trump hotel. ￼  The American Hospital Association acknowledges and defends the transformation. “These are not just ‘nice to haves,’” Nancy Foster, AHA’s vice president of quality and patient-safety policy, wrote to me in an email. “Actions hospitals can take to reduce stress and provide other psychological support can have a meaningful impact on one’s physical and behavioral health, including the ability to recover more rapidly.” But pretending that illness is an Abercrombie & Kent safari is actually harmful. These amenities have a cost, and they are not worth nearly what we’re paying for them as we’re billed for $100,000 joint replacements and $9,000 CT scans. Room charges in many hospitals can exceed $1,000 a night. And “facility fees” for outpatient procedures and even office visits can reach hundreds of dollars, and simply don’t exist elsewhere. A hospital’s function is to diagnose and to heal, at a price that sick people can afford. I dream of a no-frills Target- or Ikea-like hospital for care.  That doesn’t mean hospitals need to resemble prisons. Hospitals certainly have room to improve on breakfasts featuring Lilliputian plastic cups of orange juice and rubbery eggs. But to understand one of the many reasons Americans pay so much for health care, consider this: The best hospitals in Europe are utilitarian structures that most resemble urban high schools. When I got stitches for a deep cut in my forehead in Gemelli Hospital—where the pope gets health care—I sat on a gurney in a big dark room with other patients.  Instead of providing free coffee and a piano in a soaring, art-filled marble lobby, how about focusing on the very basic things that health systems in the U.S. should do, but—in my experience—in many cases do not, like making it easier for patients to schedule appointments? Shortening the now lengthywait timesto see physicians who take insurance plans? Paying for adequate staffing on nights and weekends, so patients don’t linger in bed pointlessly for two days until social workers return on Monday? Or ending those two-day stays in emergency rooms when all inpatient beds are full? (Hotels aspire to run at full occupancy to maximize revenue; hospitals, I’d argue, should not.) This winter, I’m planning a journey where I’m looking forward to some good food and art. We haven’t yet determined the exact destination, but it will not be a U.S. hospital.",2023-11-17T15:57:13Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
88,Atlantic,Why You Maybe Shouldn’t Write a Memoir,Arthur C. Brooks,"Want to stay current with Arthur’s writing?Sign upto get an email every time a new column comes out. Have you everthought of writing an autobiography? Lots of noncelebrity people are doing that these days: Memoirs are morecommon, as we become more comfortable sharing intimate details of our personal lives with strangers. But before you start yours, consider this: What you think is riveting about your life might not seem so to others. As one publisherput it, too many submissions are “just the writer’s own story, which is ultimately boring.” And now that you’re reconsidering your memoir project, you might even think about taking it a step further, and talk less about yourself in general. We like to talk about ourselves because, quite simply, for us it feels good. But like many superficially soothing habits, it comes at a cost to our social lives and overall well-being. With a few nudges, however, this can be quite easily corrected. Roughly 30 to 40percent of our speech is self-referential,according toa small study of university students. As for social-media use, results from an analysis of posts on one platformsuggestthat about 80 percent of us post about ourselves. Cat videos and complaints about airlines aside, social-media platforms are basically autobiographical microblogs. Why do we talk and write about ourselves so much? Because it has an instant payoff. In research conducted at Harvard and published in 2012, neuroscientistsshowedthat when people impart information about themselves to others, it stimulates the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area of the brain, which are parts of the mesolimbic dopamine system involved in delivering rewards from activities such as sex, gambling, and drinking alcohol. Not surprisingly, then, we can exhibit symptoms of an addiction to self-referential behavior. This is what the sociologist Charles Derber calls “conversational narcissism” in his book The Pursuit of Attention: Seeking a small dopamine hit, we can develop a habit of reflexively bringing every conversation around to our own life and experiences. Sometimes the mechanism takes a roundabout form, such as talking compulsively about one’s work. Someone who suffers from this syndrome might be a workaholic whose self-worth is built on their job—in which case, talking about work is really a way of talking about themselves. As is common with other addictive behaviors, constantly talking about oneself can signal the presence of an underlying mood disorder, such as depression. For a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychologyin 2019, scholars surveyed nearly 5,000 people to measure the relationship between depressive symptoms and “I-talk” (using first-person singular pronouns in speech). Theyfounda “small but reliable” positive correlation. Other researchersprovidean explanation for this: People with depression spend more time thinking about themselves than nondepressed people do, and have difficulty switching their attention to other people and things. As is commonly the case with depression, this tendency is counterproductive, in the sense that talking about oneself and disregarding others are off-putting characteristics. Depressed people need love and support, and researchshowsthat they react positively to experiencing a sense of belonging. But conversational narcissism—especially complaining—drives people away, which can make the mood disorder worse. So if you have a habit of talking about yourself, it’s a good one to break—not just for the relief of your family and friends, but also for your own mental health. Here are two ways to get started. 1. Nudge your default mode network.We talk about ourselves a lot because, naturally, we think about ourselves a lot. As a matter of fact, we typically default to thinking about ourselves when we have nothing else to think about. Researchers writing in the Journal of Cognitive Neurosciencein 2018noticedthat the same parts of the brain that are most active when we let our minds wander—the medial prefrontal cortex, including a region called the Brodmann Area 10—are involved in self-referential thinking. We engage this aptly named default mode network, or DMN, when we free our attention from external demands. In other words, left to its own devices, my mind will mostly wander aroundme: my day, my lunch, my future. This creates a self-reinforcing pattern, in which more time in the DMN encourages more self-referential thinking. Some clinicians believe that we can interrupt this pattern by decreasing DMN activity, and they recommend such techniques asmeditationandexercise. Although I’m not aware of any research that has shown it, my sense is that many people of faith pray for this reason as well. For example, Eastern Orthodox Christians commonly recite the short, hypnotic“Jesus Prayer”when they find themselves at rest. 2. Reframe the conversation.When people are blue and use more I-talk than when they are well, you might assume that the problem is the sadness, not the I-talk. But research suggests that how we choose to talk can dramatically affect how we think and feel. I have writtenpreviouslyabout the social science showing that if couples choose to use “we words” when they fight instead of “me/you words,” they demonstrate less agitation and experience fewer negative emotions, and report higher marital satisfaction. That difference can simply be that they say, “I think we have a problem,” rather than “You are causing a problem.” We can use the same principle in our speech. When you want to address a particular topic, find a way to pivot from “I/me” to “we/us.” For example, if you are tempted to complain about your job to someone, instead ask them what they’d do in the particular situation you’re unhappy about. If you’re feeling disappointed with the weather today, depersonalize your complaint by saying, “It looks as if we’re going to get rain today.” These are subtle changes, but they will put you mentally into the company of others, shifting the focus toward them and their experience, instead of orienting it always on yourself. And after all, no one is bored when you talk aboutthem. One last suggestion: If you use social media, consider whether you might be using it to natter on about yourself—in a way that could be giving you little dopamine hits but that is ultimately at the expense of your overall mental health. Go back and look at your posts from the past few months. Ask yourself, with as much objectivity as possible, if they sound as though they come from someone you’d avoid at a party. If the answer’s yes, then try a new approach. You might look for an inspiring message to post, which would give you a reason to search for positive ideas. You might make a note of the most interesting thing you see or hear every day, and post a link or photo on that. Or maybe you’ll simply engage more with people abouttheirlives instead ofyours. Whatever you decide to do, you will be breaking your I-talk habit, and won’t be priming your DMN with self-referential content. An additional benefit might be having more time on your hands because you’re not constantly checking social media—just don’t use that time to write a memoir.",2023-11-16T12:00:00Z,16.0,11.0,2023.0
89,Atlantic,What the Hunger Games Movies Always Understood,Shirley Li,"Hollywood was never going to stop making more Hunger Gamesmovies. Based on Suzanne Collins’s best-selling dystopian young-adult novels, the first four films released from 2012 to 2015 collectively grossed nearly $3 billion worldwide. They dominated pop culture: Jennifer Lawrence became a bona fide movie star; videos on how to replicate her character’s side braid flooded the internet; the phrasehunger gamesbecame shorthand for any kind of intense competition. We saw a wave of copycat franchises—Divergent,The Maze Runner, and The Mortal Instruments, among many,manyothers—that never reached The Hunger Gameslevel of success. Yet the prequel hitting theaters this weekend, titled The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,is no mere franchise extension. Yes, it tells the origin story of the series’ villain—President Coriolanus Snow, played by Donald Sutherland in the original films—and yes, it takes viewers back to Panem, the oppressive nation that forces children to slaughter one another in annual televised battle royales, but it also treads fresh territory. The film poses a question the previous Hunger Gamesmovies largely avoided: How exactly did the Games become such a cultural phenomenon—and why do we, by extension, still have an appetite for more? That may sound too meta and heady for a YA series that once placed a heavy emphasis on which suitor its heroine would choose (Team Peeta, obviously), but Balladorganically weaves a critique of its own franchise’s success into the story. The film follows Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) as a young man, and studies, through his trajectory, how the Games became must-watch programming. When Balladbegins, Coriolanus is a top student at the Capitol—the home of Panem’s privileged ruling class—desperate to win his school’s prestigious prize so that his family can continue living among the wealthy. To do so, he must mentor a tribute (one of the Games’ participants) and create the kind of drama that will revive the Games. A decade in, the event has come to feel dull and routine, neither entertaining the people of the Capitol nor punishing those in the poor districts that rebelled and led to the creation of the Games. But Coriolanus has ideas, including making the audience care more deeply about the tributes as actual humans—a goal that eventually affects his understanding of himself. This is a film, then, that considers the power of storytelling and spectacle—and how popular narratives can shape worldviews, sell ideas, and corrupt anyone. The initial Hunger Gamesfilms covered similar ground—Katniss (Lawrence) had image consultants and sat through plenty of interviews to win favors—but never as explicitly or as consistently as Balladdoes. Katniss was never a natural onstage, but both Coriolanus and his assigned tribute, Lucy Gray Baird (West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler), are performers at heart. He’s pretending to be as wealthy as his classmates are, keeping his family’s poverty a secret and manipulating those around him. She’s a gifted singer, unprepared for the horrors of the Games but plucky enough to charm people with her voice and enigmatic enough to keep her mentor guessing. The Hunger Gamesfranchise examined the influence of propaganda through Katniss’s discomfort with being a symbol, but Balladscrutinizes those ideas further by building them into its central plot. Coriolanus and Lucy Gray must attract support from the Games’ viewers; as they do, their relationship blossoms into a romance that’s never on solid footing. The film draws tension from the way both Coriolanus and Lucy Gray learn to fool their audiences—and each other. That romance is key to making Balladfeel different from The Hunger Gamesof yesteryear. Katniss’s story was about a political awakening, and the films were about a wide-scale revolution. Though its 158-minute runtime indicates otherwise,Balladhas a tighter, more intimate focus. Coriolanus, through the different chapters of his coming-of-age, comes to realize that the most effective tool for survival is a good story. That helps him guide Lucy Gray in the Games, win approval in the Capitol when the odds are against his favor, and make Ballad’s predetermined ending—Coriolanus’s turn to the dark side—meaningful rather than perfunctory. As a viewer, I found myself rooting for Coriolanus, because the film continually places him in characteristically heroic positions: the underdog in his class, one half of a star-crossed romance. When he continued the cycle of violence, I felt crushed but unsurprised. The film isn’t trying to humanize him; instead, it shows how he comes to do what most people tend to do in real life: He chooses the easier narrative, the one more people—including himself—are willing to accept. Of course the Academy’s top student has to eventually lead Panem’s regime. That’s the secret to The Hunger Gameslongevity. On the page and on the screen, the story carried a subtly cynical streak. Like the other dystopian sci-fi book-to-film adaptations that followed, it focused on children rebelling against authority to reform a world that older generations ruined—a resonant idea for young people growing up amid seemingly endless tragedies. But unlike those other titles,The Hunger Gamesunderlined Panem’s use of soft power, and showed how closely it resembles the world we live in. The Games are designed to be televised, and showmanship is as much of a skill as, say, being able to shoot a bow and arrow. In Ballad, the designer of the Games—played by a scene-stealing Viola Davis—is as powerful as Coriolanus will later be. And the Games’ host, Lucky Flickerman (a wonderfully hammy Jason Schwartzman), sprinkles his commentary with pithy observations for the masses watching. After a tribute carries out a mercy kill and earns a reward out of viewer sympathy, Lucky injects a piece of advice like he’s teaching a lesson. “That’s what happens when you do stuff,” he says. “You get attention.” Balladmay be bloated, but it understands that The Hunger Games, as a franchise, didn’t succeed because it had a clear political philosophy. (If anything, it was vague enough forany partyto latch on to.) It succeeded because it entertained; it did stuff—stuff such as cast a superstar at a pivotal point in her career and popularize a subgenre before the copycats came along—and it got attention. But more than anything,The Hunger Gamestold a story that reinforced its audience’s notions of good and evil. As much as Balladis reviving the franchise because the original installments made billions, it also recognizes—and interrogates—the fact that the Games themselves were never the draw. The reassurance that at least our world isn’t yet as bleak as that of Panem is enough.",2023-11-17T14:17:30Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
90,Atlantic,What the Gig Economy Does to a Human,Bekah Waalkes,"Technological development in the digital era has rapidly and irrevocably altered the way people relate and communicate. Joanne Mc Neil’s first book,Lurking: How a Person Became a User, is a critical history of the internet age, written from the perspective of the user. In it, she identifies an “operational clash of values between human ambiguity and machine explicitness,” concluding that “humanity is the spice, the substrate, that machines cannot replicate.” But as advances in AI in just the three years since Lurking’s publication demonstrate, this “spice” is becoming more and more replicable, especially when it comes to human writing. Mc Neil has now turned to fiction—perhaps one of the few forms AI cannot successfully write (yet)—to explore the human side of this technological drama. In her debut novel,Wrong Way, Mc Neil explores the impact of the race toward machine intelligence on a gig worker, Teresa, who is hired by the massive tech company All Over. The novel exposes the way that gig work strips people of their humanity, rendering them interchangeable cogs. Because this sort of employment is inconsistent, the worker’s life can feel episodic and fragmentary: The human need for resolution is scrambled and replaced with a constantly precarious present. Aptly named, All Over is ubiquitous in the near future that Teresa lives in, serving millions of users with its goal—expressed in perfect Silicon Valley jargon—to “shape the digital economy to fit neighborhood-centric needs.” It operates a digital payment app, as well as food-delivery, gaming, and ride-share services. And when the novel opens, the company is hiring. At 48, Teresa can’t afford her own apartment and lives with her mother in the remotest suburb of Boston, so when she hears of an opportunity to work a temporary, hourly job at All Over, she applies. “Drivers wanted,” reads the ad on Craigslist, and Teresa loves to drive. It turns out that the company is launching a fleet of driverless cars called “CRs.” The only catch? They’re not actually driverless yet. All Over’s promises have outpaced their technology, so the CRs are engineered with a secret compartment in their roof called the “nest” from which the driver can silently operate the vehicle. Teresa notices that all of the new employees at her training are slim and small: The nest is tiny, and to navigate the CR, they’ll need to lie on their stomach. The drivers are called “seers,” a job title that blurs the line between the vehicle (“CR”) and the role (“steerer”). Though the nest is cramped and the schedule is unpredictable, Teresa falls into the swing of her new job. She eventually makes enough money to move out of her mother’s house. But the long hours begin to take their toll: She hates the start and stop of traffic, so she works at night, driving from seven in the evening to nine in the morning. When she witnesses a tense encounter between a man and a woman in her vehicle, one she worries might lead to an assault, Teresa realizes there’s not much she can do, because she technically doesn’t exist. She is not just invisible, but also voiceless. Teresa doesn’t totally dislike her job. Still, its insecurity is always on her mind: “When things are good with work, all it means is things will get worse.” She speaks from experience, having held many temporary jobs in her life. Teresa recalls these past roles while swimming laps at the YMCA, her “respite from the noisy world”: department store, data entry, country club, and her “best” job, as an editor at the Brooklyn Modern museum, which she lost after reporting an intern’s plagiarism, an act of integrity her capricious boss didn’t appreciate. Since then, Teresa has found that she can’t shake her sense of vulnerability. And at her age, she feels that she has missed her window for meaningful employment. The majority of the novel is made up of Teresa’s recollections, which are occasionally heavy-handed, reflective of Mc Neil’s straightforward and thorough style in Lurking. But Teresa’s exhaustive recall of past work experience is part of the point. Her memories serve as an antidote to the alienation that gig workers can feel when they are treated as interchangeable and expected to be constantly on call. After all, machines don’t remember in the nonchronological, non-iterative way that humans do. Teresa is asserting her humanity through her nostalgia. Teresa’s almost obsessive reminiscing about her previous jobs is an expression of her desire to impose a storyline on her life. Without the stability of a career, she lacks a coherent sense of where she’s been and where she’s going. “Now that she’s been driving a while, all her work going forward is a journey toward an ending. How long can a middle go?” she reflects. This particular anxiety makes her painfully human: Most people’s lives amount to a long, boring middle with an unremarkable end. Teresa’s preoccupations reflect her feeling of being narratively lost. To be human in the age of the gig economy, the novel suggests, is to be unfulfilled, a philosophy that is in direct contrast with All Over’s. The company credo is called the “holistic apex,” which celebrates human success and the indomitable spirit. At one point, Teresa catches a TV segment featuring the CEO of All Over, Falconer Guidry, in which he boasts about the CR: “Humans can’t be programmed,” he exclaims. “We have spirits. That spirit is the beauty of humanity, but it’s also what makes us monsters on the road. Machines live by rules. Machines don’t experience road rage. Machines are calm any hour of the day, in any driving conditions.” This might seem ironic at first—Falconer is boasting about his fleet of “driverless” cars while a human driver of one of those cars watches. But Falconer is basically correct: In her role, Teresa must remain calm, follow the rules, and never make mistakes—in other words, she must act like a machine. Teresa decides that maybe All Over’s driverless fleet isn’t built entirely on a lie. The car is, in fact, driverless, she concludes, because “she’s part of the car. A seer is a car part, a battery.” The seer becomes CR. What makes us human,Wrong Waysuggests, is our ability to feel hurt, to ache, to long. But the desires for stability and for a story that makes sense are ones that, ultimately, not everyone gets to fulfill. Technological development has a human cost. Reading Mc Neil’s novel, one might wonder if it’s too late to imagine the future otherwise.",2023-11-17T12:00:00Z,17.0,11.0,2023.0
91,Atlantic,The Men Who Started the War,Drew Gilpin Faust,"Harpers Ferry seemedalmost a part of the neighborhood when I was growing up. Granted, it was across the state line, in West Virginia, and slightly more than a half-hour drive away from our Virginia farm. But it took us almost that long to get to the nearest supermarket. And I felt connected by more than roads. The placid, slow-moving Shenandoah River, which flowed past our bottom pasture, becomes raging white water by the time it joins the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry, 35 miles downstream. Nature itself seems to have designed Harpers Ferry to be a violent place. Cliffs border the confluence of the two rivers, and the raw power generated by their angry convergence made the site ideal for the national armory established there around 1800. It manufactured some 600,000 firearms before Union troops burned it down in 1861 to keep it out of Confederate hands. Five battles took place at Harpers Ferry, and the town changed hands 12 times. But none of this is what Harpers Ferry is primarily remembered for. It is known instead for an event referred to at the time as an “insurrection,” a “rebellion,” or a “crusade,” but today most often called just a “raid.” On October 16, 1859, a year and a half before the attack on Fort Sumter, in South Carolina, the white abolitionist John Brown set out to seize the federal arsenal and distribute arms to enable the enslaved to claim their freedom. His effort ended quickly and ignominiously. Badly wounded, he was carted off to jail in nearby Charles Town to be tried and executed, as were a number of his followers. In a sense, though, his insurrection was never put down. Brown, a brilliant publicist, made himself a martyr. He used the six weeks between his capture and his execution to define and defend his actions. He grounded them in a moral imperative to free the enslaved,invoked the nation’s revolutionary legacies, and warned of the conflagration to come. The “crimes of this guilty land,” he scrawled ina note he pressed on a guard shortly before his hanging, “will never be purged away; but with Blood.” Within just a few years, Americans would look back at Brown across the gulf of the Civil War and identify him as a sign of what was ahead, imbuing his sacrifice with almost supernatural meaning. Showers of meteors had filled the skies in the weeks between Brown’s capture and his execution, reinforcing perceptions that his life and death had been a singular, numinous occurrence. In the words of a song improvised by a battalion of Union soldiers as they headed south to war not two years after his death, “John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul goes marching on.” Even the attendees at his hanging seemed in retrospect to prefigure the future: Brevet Colonel Robert E. Lee was present as the commander of the U.S. troops who had captured Brown. Thomas J. (not yet “Stonewall”) Jackson led a unit of Virginia Military Institute cadets. John Wilkes Booth, President Abraham Lincoln’s future assassin, hurried from Richmond to Charles Town in a borrowed uniform to join a militia troop sent to police the hanging.He hated Brown’s cause but admired his audacity. Many upstanding northern citizens—as well as much of the press—condemned Brown’s lawlessness. But others, Black and white, hailed his attack on slavery and mourned his death. On the day of his execution, 3,000 people gathered in Worcester, Massachusetts, to honor Brown; 1,400 attended a service in Cleveland. Agathering of Black Americans in Detroithonored the “martyr” who had “freely delivered up his life for the liberty of our race in this country.” The celebration of John Brown by Black Americans rested in the hope, and later the conviction, that his actions had set an irreversible course toward freedom—a second founding, its birth in violence as legitimate as the first one had been. When does war start?When does violence become justified? When does it shift from prohibited to permitted and even necessary? Those questions hang in the air at Harpers Ferry, compelling us to ask: When did the Civil War actually begin—and end? Brown drew the admiring attention of almost every prominent American writer—Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Melville, Longfellow, Whittier. But some among the nation’s northern elite did more than praise and defend Brown. Thinking back in his autobiography to events half a century earlier, and relying on a diary he kept in the 1850s, the abolitionist and writer Thomas Wentworth Higginson reflected onwhat a duty to morality demands when “law and order” stand on “the wrong side” of right and justice. For him, this was not a theoretical question. He was thinking about the role he’d played long before armies massed on battlefields. He was thinking about the process by which “honest American men” had evolved into “conscientious law-breakers,” until “good citizenship” became a “sin” and bad citizenship a “duty.” Higginson was one among a small group of prominent white men who had known about the Harpers Ferry raid in advance and provided the financial support that enabled Brown to buy weapons and equipment. They came to be known as the Secret Six. During the 1850s, a succession of legislative and judicial measures had tightened slavery’s grip on the nation. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 compelled the North to become complicit in returning those who had escaped slavery to southern bondage. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 overturned the Missouri Compromise of a generation earlier, which had restricted the expansion of slavery into the northern territories. The Supreme Court’s Dred Scottdecision, in 1857, established that no Black person could be considered a citizen or hold any “rights which the white man was bound to respect.” The perpetuation of slavery and racial injustice appeared to have become enshrined as an enduring national commitment, with the federal government assuming the role of active enforcer. Faced with such developments, the Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass found himself losing hope of ending slavery through moral suasion or political action; he came to see violence as necessary if emancipation was ever to be accomplished. Slavery itself, he believed, represented an act of war. The justification for violence already existed; whether—and how—to use it became more a pragmatic decision than a moral one. White abolitionists, too, became radicalized by the developments of the 1850s.The group that became the Secret Six included five Boston Brahmins and a lone New Yorker, all highly respectable citizens, well educated, of good families and heritage; all men of means and in several cases very substantial means. The path that the Six took toward violence began with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. The prospect and, soon, the reality of Black people being apprehended on the streets of Boston or New York and summarily shipped to the South brought the cruelty and arbitrariness of slavery directly before northerners’ eyes. Three men who would later be part of the Six were early members of the Boston Vigilance Committee, established to prevent the enforcement of fugitive-slave legislation. Samuel Gridley Howe was a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Medical School. He claimed descent from a participant in the Boston Tea Party, and had demonstrated his commitment to republican government by serving as a surgeon in the Greek Revolution in the 1820s. Theodore Parker was a powerful preacher and Transcendentalist whose radicalism so marginalized him within Unitarianism that he established his own independent congregation of some 2,000 members. His oratory attracted legions of followers, who shared his reformist and antislavery views. Higginson, descended from one of the original settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Divinity School and held a pulpit with a fervently antislavery Worcester congregation. He suffered his first battle wound in the unsuccessful effort to free Anthony Burns, who had fled enslavement in Virginia and was seized in Boston in 1854 under the provisions of the new act. With the encouragement of the Boston Vigilance Committee, the city erupted. Parker incited a crowd with a fiery speech at Faneuil Hall, and Higginson distributed axes to those assembled outside the courthousewhere Burns was being held. He himself led an assault on the building with a battering ram. In the ensuing melee, a courthouse guard was killed and Higginson suffered a saber wound on his chin, leaving a scar he proudly displayed for the rest of his life. Higginson viewed the effort to free Burns as the beginning of a “revolution”—the shift from words to action he had sought. The killing of the guard, he later reflected, was “proof that war had really begun.” Violence had become both necessary and legitimate. (Burns was captured and returned to Virginia, but his freedom was eventually purchased by northern abolitionists. He attended Oberlin and became a minister.) Higginson, Parker, and Howe soon turned their attention to Kansas, where a battle was escalating over whether the territory should become a slave state or a free state. In the spring of 1856, proslavery forces attacked a town founded by antislavery settlers from Massachusetts. John Brown, a longtime opponent of slavery who had joined his sons in Kansas with the intention of preventing its permanent establishment there, sought retribution; he and his allies killed five proslavery men in front of their families in a place called Pottawatomie. This murderous act hovered over Brown’s reputation—and later his legacy—instilling doubts in some potential supporters and leading others simply to deny that Brown had played a role in the killings, a stance that was aided by Brown’s own misrepresentations. But to many, Brown’s extremism was a source of attraction, not revulsion. The newly created Massachusetts State Kansas Aid Committee channeled outside support. Higginson sent crates of rifles, revolvers, knives, and ammunition, as well as a cannon, to Kansas. He celebrated Kansas as the equivalent of Bunker Hill—a “rehearsal,” he later called it, for the more extensive violence to come. It was because of Kansasthat the six men who would conspire to support the Harpers Ferry raid found one another and identified Brown as the instrument of what they had come to regard as necessary violence. Like Parker, Higginson, and Howe, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn and George Luther Stearnshad become active supporters of the Massachusetts State Kansas Aid Committee. A Harvard graduate who was a schoolteacher in Concord, Sanborn had been deeply influenced by Parker’s preaching while he was in college. Sanborn’s Transcendentalist ideas, with their skepticism about existing social structures and institutions, were further reinforced by his Concord neighbors Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Stearns was a wealthy manufacturer whose ancestors included some of the original settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as well as an officer in the American Revolution. Long active in abolition, he had established a station of the Underground Railroad near his Medford home and drew on his considerable fortune to send weapons to Kansas free-state settlers. The last of the Six was Gerrit Smith, said to be the wealthiest man in New York State. Smith, like Stearns, would supply significant financial support to Brown. He had long been active in politics, seeking the destruction of slavery through political means, but by 1856 he had come to believe that it was time, as he put it, to move beyond ballots and start “looking to bayonets.” Parker, too, was preaching more forceful measures. “I used to think this terrible question of freedom or slavery in America would be settled without bloodshed,” he wrote to Higginson. “I believe it no longer.” By the end of 1856, under the leadership of a commanding new territorial governor, violence in Kansas had begun to subside, and a free-state electoral victory seemed all but assured. The following year, Brown began traveling throughout New England and New York to raise money for a fresh attack on human bondage—his new plan as yet unspecified. In Boston, he presented Sanborn with a letter of introduction from Smith. Sanborn in turn arranged for Stearns, Howe, and Parker to meet Brown. Uncertain what Brown intended, Higginson at first kept his distance, even though Sanborn pressed him, insisting that Brown could do “more to split the Union than any man alive.” The ideals of the once noble American experiment could be sustained only by separating from slavery or by destroying it. In February 1858, Brown revealed his plan for the Harpers Ferry attack to Smith and Sanborn. Not long after, all of the Massachusetts conspirators met with Brown in his Boston hotel room and formally constituted themselves as the Secret Committee of Six to support Brown in planning and financing the raid. Stearns was to be the official chair, Sanborn the secretary. They would keep careful records, with an elaborate ledger and a dues schedule. It was as if a clandestine organization of accountants had set to planning an uprising. The raid’s actualoccurrence surprised them—with both its timing and its swift and disastrous outcome. On October 16, 1859, Brown and a party of 21 seized the federal arsenal, eventually taking several dozen hostages. The uprising of the enslaved that Brown expected never materialized, and local militia soon cut off the bridges that were the only escape route. Brown and his men blockaded themselves in the armory’s fire-engine house, where they exchanged intermittent gunfire with the troops surrounding them. On October 18, Colonel Lee and a regiment of U.S. Marines broke down the engine-house door. Wounded by a saber cut, Brown was taken prisoner and transported to the nearby Charles Town jail. Ten of Brown’s men, including two of his sons, were killed; seven, including Brown, were captured and later executed. Four civilians were killed, as was one Marine. To the great dismay of the Secret Six, Brown’s papers and correspondence were found at the farm where Brown had been living in Maryland. The Six were stunned. In the press and in government offices, accusations flew. Many suspected that Frederick Douglass must have played a role. More than a decade before the raid, Douglass had met Brown and been moved by their conversations to question his own belief in the possibility of a peaceful end to slavery. “My utterances,” he later wrote, “became more and more tinged by the color of this man’s strong impressions.” When Brown took up arms in Kansas, Douglass’s appreciation for his boldness and conviction was only enhanced. Yet Douglass proved unwilling to join Brown when he revealed his Harpers Ferry plans. The scheme struck him as dangerously impractical and risky—“a steel-trap.” In the aftermath of the raid, Douglass seemed almost embarrassed that he had not offered Brown more support, that he had permitted realism to trump daring. He could not conceal his admiration for the would-be liberator’s courage, but concerns for his own survival won the day. Douglass fled north to Canada and then to England, where he remained for nearly half a year. Although Douglass was all too aware of his vulnerability, the Six, protected by their social position, had been defying authority with seeming impunity for years. Their recognition of personal peril came as a shock. The Six had embraced violence out of both entitlement and desperation. In public and private communications, they frequently invoked their revolutionary heritage, their biological connections to the country’s Founders—to those who had pitched tea into Boston Harbor and fought at Lexington and Bunker Hill. This was a legacy—and a responsibility—that required them to act with equivalent courage and decisiveness. They believed that in some sense, they owned the nation, and their sense of privilege fueled a confident assumption of immunity from serious consequence. But with Harpers Ferry, it seemed, they might have gone a step too far. Letters from Smith, Stearns, Howe, and Sanborn were found among Brown’s papers and featured in the press before the end of October. Five of the Six were quickly exposed and excoriated. (Parker, who had left the country before the raid in a futile search for a cure to his tuberculosis, was identified within a few months.) Smith fell into a frenzy of worry about being indicted. After becoming, according to his physician, “quite deranged, intellectually as well as morally,” he was committed in early November to the Utica Lunatic Asylum. After consulting a Boston lawyer, Sanborn, Stearns, and Howe made their way to Canada (and Howe published an article disavowing Brown). All three returned to the U.S., but Canada remained a refuge. Howe and Sanborn went back and forth twice. Higginson, both at the time and later, was contemptuous of his fellow conspirators’ cowardice. John Brown deserved better from them. “We of the Six,” he maintained years later, “were not—are not—great men.” But Brown, he believed, was. Higginson neither hid nor fled. He busied himself raising money for Brown’s defense and endeavoring to devise a scheme to facilitate Brown’s escape. But even for Higginson, who seems never to have contemplated a battle or a risk he didn’t relish, these plans seemed too far-fetched. Instead, with admiration, Higginson watched Brown’s display of undaunted courage throughout his trial as he refused to plead insanity or back down in his commitment to ending slavery through whatever means necessary. Brown would do far more from the grave than he could have ever imagined accomplishing in life. Higginson spent the day of his sentencing with Brown’s wife and the remaining members of his family on their bleak and remote upstate–New York farm. The congressional committee appointed in December to investigate the origins and supporters of Brown’s raid proved only a feeble threat to the six conspirators. Higginson, to his disappointment, was never called to testify at all. Howe and Stearns dodged, equivocated, and at times outright lied. Smith was judged too unwell to attend. Parker died in Italy in May 1860 without ever returning to the United States. Sanborn’s fears were at last realized when the U.S. Marshals he had eluded for so long arrived at his house in Concord to compel his testimony. Citizens of the town rose up to prevent his removal while a judge sympathetic to Sanborn was located to issue a writ of habeas corpus. In the end, the congressional hearings were a tepid affair, likely because southern representatives came to recognize that the less attention given to abolitionist voices, the better. The next battle in the war that Brown had begun would not be long in coming. While he bided his time, Higginson published in February 1860 the first of a series of articles in The Atlanticthat he referred to as his “Insurrection Papers.” After writing essays on “The Maroons of Jamaica” and “The Maroons of Surinam”—Black groups who had escaped enslavement to establish their own independent societies on the fringes of white settlement—he proceeded to publish admiring essays on Denmark Vesey,Nat Turner, and Gabriel, men who had embraced violence in their efforts to overturn American slavery. In addition to his writing, Higginson devoted the 16 months between Brown’s execution and the firing on Fort Sumter to reading about military strategy and drills, and to practicing shooting and swordplay. In 1862, this man of words returned to the world of action. He would fulfill “the dream of a lifetime” as the colonel commanding the First South Carolina Volunteers, a regiment of the formerly enslaved. This commission embodied what he had believed in for so long: the mobilization of force in the cause of Black freedom, as well as the arming of Black men in their own liberation. Both during and after the war, the careers of the Secret Six fell along a spectrum. Stearns never went to war himself but recruited thousands of Black troops into what he referred to as “John Brown regiments”; when the war was over, he helped found the Freedmen’s Bureau, which provided land and other assistance to newly freed African Americans. Howe worked with the Sanitary Commission, a relief agency founded to support sick and wounded soldiers, and, like Stearns, was involved with the Freedmen’s Bureau after the war. Smith emerged from the Utica asylum fragile and aversive to any conversation about Harpers Ferry. He gave a significant amount of money to Stearns’s Black regiments. And yet, in 1867, he was also among those who paid the bond that freed Jefferson Davis from prison. Sanborn appointed himself the custodian of Brown’s legacy, publishing four books and some 75 articles about him. (Many of the articlesappeared in this magazine.) Sanborn cultivated the memory of a kinder, gentler Brown, downplaying the violence he had perpetrated. He did not know until the 1870s that Brown had lied to him about his central and murderous role at Pottawatomie. Higginson was unapologetic. In 1879, when he remarried after the death of his first wife, Higginson chose Harpers Ferry as the site for their honeymoon, introducing his bride to prominent landmarks from the raid, the trial, and the hanging. Higginson never forgave himself for not doing more to support Brown and for failing to persuade him to adopt a plan that was more likely to succeed. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the raid, in 1909, Higginson joined Sanborn, the only other surviving member of the Secret Six, and Howe’s widow, Julia, in Concord, where they were interviewed by a journalist. (Julia Ward Howe had in 1862 published on the cover of The Atlanticdifferent lyrics for the tune of “John Brown’s Body”: the immortal words of “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”) As a writer and an activist, Higginson had remained deeply engaged in public life, notably on behalf of women’s rights; his views on race and Black suffrage tended to shift with time and circumstance, and he was far from the radical of the prewar years. But in the Concord interview, he expressed no second thoughts about his commitment to violence on behalf of abolition—either at Harpers Ferry or within the legitimating framework of the Civil War. I learned the storyof John Brown at an early age. It might have been that my father told my siblings and me about the history of Harpers Ferry as we drove along Route 340, peering down the cliffsides at the town and the rushing water below. Or Brown might have been one of those historical personages whose names we just knew, inhaled from the Virginia air around us. People like Stonewall Jackson and John Mosby and Turner Ashby, who had all likely ridden across the very fields surrounding our house. When I was growing up, I was always proud to live in a place associated with so many famous forebears. It was many years before I thought to question what their fame and vaunted heroism had been in service of. But I knew from the outset that Brown’s renown was different. He was, I was told, a madman, undertaking a scheme that was doomed to fail—a suicide mission. When I wrote about Brown for my first term paper in high school, that was the story I told. From 1859 onward, many observers, reporters, and, later, historians adopted the view that Brown was insane, and by the mid-20th century, when I was in school, it had become a widely held assumption among white Americans. Rather than a “meteor” anticipating or inaugurating the larger war that would end slavery, Brown became no more than an aberration. Violence was reduced to a mental-health problem. The interpretation reassuringly diminished the moral force of Brown’s actions and suggested that only madness could lead to dreams of overthrowing white dominance and Black subordination. This message was intended to emphasize the strength and immutability of the racial hierarchies that remained in place well after slavery’s end, surviving Reconstruction and enshrined in Jim Crow. It minimized the threat Brown posed and by implication all but removed him—and his insistence on the moral evil of slavery—from any place in explanations of the Civil War’s origins. The Lost Cause portrait of a conflict fought by two honorable opponents who differed primarily on constitutional views about states’ rights could remain intact and unchallenged. Even in the days just after the raid, though, there were those who insisted on acknowledging the historic import of Harpers Ferry as well as the sanity and determination of John Brown. Governor Henry Wise of Virginia came to Harpers Ferry to interview Brown after his capture and rejected the idea that Brown was a lunatic: “They are mistaken who take him to be a madman,” he said. He left with an impression of him as “a man of clear head … cool, collected, and indomitable.” A sane Brown was far more dangerous. If his actions were rational, then the South must regard them as proof that the North was plotting the violent overthrow of slavery. The South, Wise insisted, needed to take active measures to defend itself and its way of life. One South Carolina politician described the raid as “fact coming to the aid of logic”: the South’s worst fears made real. Harpers Ferry was the moment that changed everything. The rabidly proslavery Wise and the radical abolitionist Higginson agreed on little else, but this they regarded as self-evident. To accept slavery as the cause of the Civil War dictates setting the conflict within a longer trajectory of violence, one that starts at least with John Brown rather than Fort Sumter. Higginson would perhaps have us date the war from his saber cut in 1854. Douglass might well argue that it began in 1619. And when did the Civil War end? Historians studying the era after Appomattox have in recent years emphasized the persistence of violence through and beyond Reconstruction, as intransigent former Confederates turned from organized military force to beatings, burnings, whippings, shootings, and lynchings in the effort to suppress newly gained Black freedom. The war, the historians argue, simply continued in other forms. It is as difficult and complicated to say when the Civil War ended as to determine when it began. In the years since 1859,John Brown and his raid have become a touchstone in America’s struggle to reconcile—or at least represent—the complex connections between force and freedom. The United States was founded in violent resistance and then guaranteed its survival as a nation eight decades later in a bloody Civil War. Violence is at the heart of our national mythology. The Secret Six drew explicitly on that mythology in their writing. It is central to our national creed. But violence has also, as Frederick Douglass reminds us, rested at the core of the social and legal order that mandated and sustained the oppression of millions of Americans from the early 17th century into our own time. Violence could enslave and violence could free. The purpose mattered. As Douglass declared, looking back on the Civil War in a Decoration Day speech honoring the Union dead in 1883, “Whatever else I may forget, I shall never forget the difference between those who fought for liberty and those who fought for slavery.” The Black community did not forget that Brown had fought for liberty. After the war, his raid and his death continued to be commemorated across the North. In a stirring address at Storer College, founded in Harpers Ferry in 1867 to educate African Americans, Douglass insisted that Brown had not failed, but had begun the “war that ended slavery.” W. E. B. Du Bois held Brown in similarly high esteem. In 1906, the second gathering of the Niagara Movement, the predecessor of the NAACP, was held at Harpers Ferry in acknowledgment of Brown’s contributions to Black rights. Delegates from the NAACP met there in 1932 intending to dedicate a plaque in Brown’s honor. In a speech at that meeting titled “The Use of Force in Reform,” Du Bois expressed few compunctions about the use of violence: Brown, he said, “took human lives … He took them in Kansas and he took them here. He meant to take them. He meant to use force to wipe out an evil he could no longer endure.” Langston Hughes used poetry rather than oratory to address African American readers as he invoked the lingering memory of John Brown. Hughes, whose grandmother had been married to one of the Black conspirators killed in the raid, celebrated “John Brown / Who took his gun, / Took twenty-one companions / White and black, / Went to shoot your way to freedom.”Hughes recalledthat his grandmother had preserved her husband’s bullet-ridden shawl. As a small boy, he was sometimes wrapped in it. “You will remember / John Brown,” Hughes insisted. But, fittingly, given his defining commitment to nonviolence, Martin Luther King Jr. remained silent on Brown. Even as the keynote speaker at a centennial observance of Brown’s raid, King did not mention the man once. The place of violence in the centuries of struggle for Black freedom has been long contested, and by the mid-1960s, King faced growing demands from Black activists urging forceful resistance to white threats and assaults instead of the Gandhian passivity that underpinned his philosophy. Malcolm X regarded Brown as “the only good white the country’s ever had.” The Black Power movement that challenged King’s vision of a Beloved Community could claim deep roots. Barack Obama reflected the long tradition of Black appreciation for Brown in his 2006 book,The Audacity of Hope. Brown’s “willingness to spill blood,” Obama said, demonstrated that “deliberation alone” would not suffice to end slavery. “Pragmatism,” he concluded, “can sometimes be moral cowardice.” As a nation, we are unable to get over John Brown. And as a nation, we have not figured out what violence we will condemn and what we will celebrate. I found myself unspeakably moved as I stood before Nat Turner’s Bible in the National Museum of African American History and Culture. At the same time, I am horrified by the violence of the January 6 rioters and by what I regard as widespread threats to the rule of law. We pride ourselves on being a country with a written Constitution that sets peaceful parameters for government. Yet the Supreme Court established by that Constitution has issued rulings providing that the citizenry may be armed not just for recreational hunting, butwith weapons, including assault rifles, that are frequently purchased with an eye toward resisting that very government. Lawmakers walk the floors of the Capitol withpins shaped like AR-15s in their lapels. The rule of law seems historically and inextricably enmeshed in the tolerance—even the encouragement—of violence. In the years leading up to the Civil War, antislavery Americans like the Secret Six turned to what Higginson—with a keen awareness of the oxymoron—called conscientious lawbreaking. Douglass came to embrace the legitimacy of violence, but recognized it as justified “only when all other means of progress and enlightenment have failed”—and only when there is a “thing worse than” violence that makes it necessary. The existence and endurance of our nation has depended on that careful discernment, on that conscientiousness, in deciding when we truly face a “thing worse than.” It is not merely a historical question. A deep-seated ambivalence about violence defines us still.

92,Atlantic,The Daily Responsibility of Democracy,Tom Nichols,"Much of America’s politics has descended into ignorant, juvenile stunts that distract us from the existential danger facing democracy. Citizens must take up the burden of being the adults in the room. First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Don’t Argue With Uncle Ned One of the more rewarding parts of a newsletter like The Dailyis that it allows writers to have an ongoing conversation with readers, and to return to themes and discussions over time. This is also a nice way of saying that now and then, I’m going to pull up something I wrote a while ago, because I think people need to keep hearing it. (As I saidyesterdaywhen examining the wordfascist, I am something of a pedant, and the professor in me is always still lurking around here.) So before we break for the weekend and start preparing for our Thanksgiving celebrations, I want to revisit an argument I made nearly two years ago—something I think might help make the holiday a bit less stressful around the dinner table. It is a simple recommendation, but one that will be hard for many of us to follow: In a time of clownish, adolescent, and highly dangerous politics, those of us defending American democracy must be the adults in the room. We must be measured, determined, and even a bit stoic. Let us recall what prodemocracy citizens are up against. Donald Trump and many of his supporters in Republican politics are, in effect, a reality show, an ongoing comedy-drama full of Main Characters and plot twists and silly caricatures of heels and heroes. Think of Kari Lake, with hersoft-focus, super-earnest TV presence. Watch Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin hitch up his pants andoffer to duke it outwith a Teamster, in a dopey scene that Hollywood would have left on the cutting-room floor. Tune in to Newsmax and chuckle as Representative Tim Burchett complains that Representative Kevin Mc Carthygave him an elbowin the kidneys. Smirk along with the anchors asthey suggestthat Representative Nancy Mace, if Mc Carthy funds her challengers, might reveal some dirt—wink wink, nudge nudge—on the former speaker. Trump himself is a man both menacing and ludicrous, one of the most improbable figures ever to be at the center of a cult of personality. His whining, his weird mannerisms, his obsession with personal cosmetics—all make him an easy target for jokes and nicknames. But none of this should drag us into acting like children ourselves. Trump and his supporters might be inane in many ways, but they are deadly serious about their intentions to take power and destroy democracy. Their cavorting and capering is part of who they are, but it is also bait, a temptation to distraction and an invitation to sink to their level. As Iwrote in 2021: In the ensuing years, I’ve suggested often on social media that people also forgo calling the current Florida governor “De Satan,” “Death Santis,” and other grade-school epithets. I get it: It’s fun and sometimes funny. But as I warned, it also signals a needless lack of seriousness about the threat to democracy: This advice does not mean being quiet or avoiding conflict or engaging in false compromise for the sake of peace during dinner. Rather, it is advice to be steadfast and calm. When Uncle Ned (he regularly appears in my hypothetical family dinners) goes on about Obummer or the Biden Crime Family, nothing is gained by railing back about Cheeto Jesus or Mango Mussolini. Such language just convinces others that your arguments are no less childish than theirs. Instead, be direct and uncompromising: “You’re wrong. I think you know that you’re wrong, and I think, in your heart, you know you’re making a terrible mistake.” That’s the best you can do in a family setting. Among friends, the approach might be different: “You know that these conspiracy theories are not true. And Donald Trump is a fascist. You’re not. But that’s what you’re supporting.” Whether to continue that friendship probably depends on what happens next. Unlike some of my gentler friends and colleagues, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with ending friendships over deep political divides, but as much as possible, be kind, be patient, be polite—but be unyielding in what you know is right. When I was in high school, I read Meditations,by the Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius. I’ve read it many times since, in the hope that I will fully grasp all of it before I depart the planet. But I’ve kept a few quotes nearby for years, including his admonition that other people, even if they are “meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly,” are no different from any of us and, like you and me, possess “a share of the divine.” He also warned us, however, not to become like those who might hate us: “Will any man despise me? Let him see to it. But I will see to it that I may not be found doing or saying anything that deserves to be despised.” This is tough advice, and I fail at it regularly. But the key is that you can’t change other people; you can control only whatyoudo, and whatyoudo will influence other people more than silly nicknames, mug-shaming, and gossiping. Saving democracy sometimes requires flags and marches and dramatic gestures. For most of us, however, democracy is preserved one day, and one conversation, at a time.

I’ve been writing about heavy stuff all week, so I think it’s time for a recommendation for something more entertaining. All of this talk about fascism reminded me of a movie that I really enjoyed and forgot to rave about when I saw it:Jojo Rabbit, a 2019 film directed by Taika Waititi, about a lonely young boy living with his mother in World War II Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler—played by Waititi, a New Zealander of Maori and Jewish descent—is his imaginary friend. And it gets weirder from there. The movie veers from hilarious to painful to deeply touching. Waititi’s Hitler is both silly and terrifying. (You can see why this movie occurred to me today.) It’s not for everyone; many critics liked it—and it won Waititi an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay—but some really hated it for what they saw as a trivialization of Nazism. I think that’s a charge that misses the point of the movie, but it’s definitely a strange picture. And I won’t spoil the surprise, but if you make it to the end, you’ll find one of the best uses of music in a movie I’ve ever seen. — Tom Katherine Hu contributed to this newsletter.

93,Atlantic,The Mobster Who Bought His Son a Hockey Team,Rich Cohen,"There’s nothing sadder than a small city. A small town has its lawns and picket fences and wholesome values, a big town its go-getters and civic fathers. A big city has its strivers and fine food and bright lights. But a small city, full of drifters and vacant lots, faded Victorian houses lining its weed-buckled streets, is ruinously sad. Such a city will have many of the bad elements of a metropolis and few of the good. It will have desperate people, lost causes, and crime. It will have mobsters. Danbury, Connecticut, is the ultimate small city. Depending on whom you ask, Jimmy Galante was either one of its mobsters or a legit businessman whose waste-removal company had become associated with the Mafia.The New York Timesdescribed him as “a Danbury trash hauler suspected of mob ties” who had a story “right out of ‘The Sopranos.’ ” Yet in some ways Galante’s biography seemed unlike that of a traditional hood. He was born in the Bronx but grew up in bucolic South Salem, New York; did a stint in the Air Force; and then took a job driving a garbage truck. In the mid-to-late 1970s, he started his own company, Automated Waste Disposal, and by 2004, he’d built it into a trash-collection empire of companies valued at about $100 million. Though he lived with his wife and two children in suburban New Fairfield, he was beloved in nearby Danbury, where he had his office. Galante was a philanthropist; a pediatric suite in the emergency department of Danbury Hospital was named for his family. However, he’d been to prison for tax evasion. And, according to court papers filed by the U.S. Attorney’s office, his business disputes occasionally ended in violence: But Jimmy Galante was smart, and the G-men could never quite nail him. He did have a weakness, though. Now and then, he liked to make an elaborate gesture, something attention-getting. In 2004, this meant buying a minor-league-hockey franchise and installing it at the local youth rink, the Danbury Ice Arena. Some say he did it as a civic benefactor, to give a depressed city something to rally around. (“I wanted to bring something back to the community,” Galante told me when I spoke with him in February.) Some say he did it for the same reason he owned a race-car squad: He loved to compete. Everyone, however, agrees that he did it at least in part for his son, AJ, who was 17. A senior at New Fairfield High, AJ had been an alternate captain of his school’s hockey team, which played at the Danbury Ice Arena with Jimmy often in attendance. Then AJ had gotten hurt. “He was a defenseman and hit a kid,” Galante said. “It was a clean shot …[but] they came right at AJ, and he had a very severe knee injury, couldn’t play hockey anymore. Like any father, you want to be able to do something for your son.” As AJ explained it to me: “It happened at dinner. My father said, out of nowhere, ‘If I ever buy a hockey team, you’re going to run it.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, sure.’ Then, two days later, he said, ‘Okay, I bought the team.’ ” True to his word, Galante made his son the team’s general manager. AJ did one of his first press calls on a cellphone in a New Fairfield High School hallway,the interview ending abruptly when a teacher walked by. The story of Galante’s team has become legend in Fairfield County, where I live. I first heard it from a father on the sidelines of a Little League game soon after I moved in. I hear it again every time my son Micah’s Squirt Division travel team plays a home game at the Danbury arena. On such nights, I suppose I’m just like Galante was, rooting for my son in the crazed way understood by all hockey parents. I know it’s not healthy, but I can’t help myself. If Micah’s short career—he’s currently 10 years old—were, God forbid, to come to a sudden end, I’d gladly enlist a mobster to buy him a team so he could still have a future in hockey. Maybe that’s why I became obsessed with this story: It connects our little home rink with an epic of the human hockey condition. Also, it’s funny as hell—The Sopranosmeets Slap Shot. And it all ended in an FBI raid and subsequent indictment that landed Galante in the slammer, along with the infamous gangster Matthew Ianniello,a k a Matty the Horse, the then-86-year-oldcapo di tutti capiof the Genovese crime family. Jimmy Galantepurchased an expansion franchise in the United Hockey League, the equivalent of Double A baseball. A UHL season was about 80 games followed by playoffs; the champion took home the Colonial Cup. It was a violent league made of players on the way up, players on the way down, and some players simply holding on, happy to live in the limbo of the minor leagues. The UHL comprised 14 teams, including the Quad City Mallards, the Elmira Jackals, the Flint Generals, the Fort Wayne Komets, the Kalamazoo Wings, and the Adirondack Frostbite. Galante named his team for the family business: the Trashers. The jerseys featured the team mascot, Scrappy, a garbage can with the lid raised just enough to reveal two almond-shaped eyes peering from the darkness. AJ spent the summer after his senior year assembling a roster. It was all new to him, but he was sure of the player he wanted most:Brent Gretzky, the brother of the NHL legend Wayne. “First of all, he was a really good player,” AJ explained, “and second, the name recognition.” Gretzky, at 32, was in the descent portion of his career. He almost looked like Wayne—the same intelligent eyes and long face, the same scraggly mall-rat hair—but not quite. Something was off-brand, faded; he was like a dollar bill that’d been through the wash. He’d already played 12 seasons of pro hockey: a total of 13 games in the NHL, followed by years of wandering the minors. He was a star in the UHL, having scored 43 goals for the Port Huron Beacons the previous season. When it came time to negotiate Gretzky’s contract, AJ turned the deal over to his father. The UHL had a salary cap that limited teams to a total of approximately $275,000 for the whole roster. Gretzky reportedly earned $100,000, which would have left little for the rest of the team. But Galante got around it in classic mob fashion: no-show jobs. According to the indictment filed with the U.S. District Court in Connecticut, in addition to skating for the Trashers, several players (or their wives) were on the payrolls of his various companies—salesperson, sales manager, whatever. Although the Trashers’ reported budget came in under the cap, the feds would later claim that for the 2004–05 season the actual figure was approximately $750,000. AJ knew the sort of team he wanted: skill plus muscle, skaters plus goons. He fashioned his club as the bad boys, the evil empire of the UHL:If we can’t beat you, we’re at least gonna beat you up.At home they took to the ice to “Welcome to the Jungle,” by Guns N’ Roses. AJ considered it unfair to fans if a game had fewer than three fights. That was the minimum; that was getting your money’s worth. “We just figured,We’re going to make a team everyone loves to hate,” AJ said. “Whether people deny it or not, everyone loves a hockey fight.” He found skill players on the internet, assembling his squad the way he might have assembled a fantasy-football team. That meant late-night sessions on hockeydb.com, where he searched for telling stats. After signing Gretzky, he went for Jim Duhart, the Crash Davis of minor-league hockey. Having collected 563 goals over the course of his 15 seasons in various leagues, Duhart gave the Trashers a second genuine scoring threat. But his fights are what people remember. If you search Jim Duhart, those are what you find:Jim Duhart versus Tom Clayton,Jim Duhart versus Jason Taylor. AJ filled out the roster with a mix of has-beens and might-bes. Most of these guys, if they’d been drafted into the NHL, had gone late, in the triple digits. If asked why they hadn’t made it, they’d tell you no one had ever really given them a shot. Mario Larocque was different: He’d been taken in the first round of the 1996 NHL draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning. All told, he played just five games for them. Tampa Bay fans still include him among their grievances: a wasted pick. He was one of those players who had everything except whatever mysterious quality it is that separates Wayne from Brent, the Yes from the Not Quite. AJ was more freewheeling when shopping for muscle. He searched two places, one actual, one virtual. The first was the famed Quebec League (officially the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey), which can be thought of as an aquarium stocked with fighting fish: young goons and old goons, bald goons and goons with mullets. During the 2010–11 season, the Quebec League averaged 3.2 fights a game. The second place AJ looked was where any other fan might have:hockeyfights.com, a website that aggregates footage of brawls on the ice. “I wouldn’t look for the most penalty minutes,” he told me. “I’d look for the guys with the best entertainment rating.” The Trashers featured some of the most storied names in hockey violence.Jon “Nasty” Mirasty, a Cree from Saskatchewan, wore a Mohawk, sometimes multicolored, and would average eight penalty minutes a game for Danbury.Frank “The Animal” Bialowas, a legend in hockey circles, had played three games in the NHL, then spent the rest of his career in the minors, rambling from rink to rink, like a bad man in a Western. “No one wanted to fight him,” AJ said. “The intimidation factor was unreal.”Rumun Ndurwas the only Nigerian-born player ever to make it to the NHL. But AJ’s favorite was Brad “Wingnut” Wingfield. Unlike most enforcers, Wingnut could really play. His job was to be the Kevin Costner to Brent Gretzky’s Whitney Houston. The 2004–05 Trashersblew through the UHL like a freak storm. They led the league in penalty minutes. Wins came in bunches. They were always pulling them out late, clearing the bench, fighting and celebrating. “That team was uniquely physical, to put it nicely,” Doug Christiansen, a 6-foot-5 Trashers wing, told me. “It was a different day of hockey.” Life for the Trashers was life on the road, going from small city to small city. They loved playing for Jimmy, because he took care of them. Most teams rode in a rickety,Partridge Family–style bus. The Trashers traveled in a luxury coach; they played card games and talked all night. Good hotels, a beautiful locker room—several players remember their tenure on the team as their most satisfying time in pro hockey. When asked whether they knew anything about the other side of Galante’s life, most said something along the lines of Not exactly, but we did know we were well taken care of. “First of all, if you look at the bus, it was pretty sick,” Mario Larocque told me. “So we knew Jimmy had resources.” Questioned about the no-show jobs, former players laughed and changed the subject. One player told me he didactualwork in waste removal for Galante—nothing no-show about his job. Galante spent $3 million to refurbish the Danbury Ice Arena. It held fewer than 3,000 seats, the fewest in the UHL, but it had a jewel-box intimacy. Little separated the team from its fans, physically or culturally: They mostly made nothing, were going nowhere, and knew unfairness. “Danbury is a blue-collar town, and they could relate to the players,” Galante told me. “Let’s face it: What else does Danbury really have?” The rowdiest spectators were cordoned off in Section 102, directly behind the visitors’ bench. Parents were warned to keep children away. It was populated by the die-hard, the angry, and the drunk. And the noise—my God, the noise! It had to do with the acoustics. Now and then, AJ would watch a game from Section 102. One night, he got into a shouting match with a stranger who turned out to be the visiting team’s general manager—the result being a call to AJ from Richard Brosal, the UHL commissioner, followed by a short suspension. Which was the point: The Danbury Ice Arena was the sort of place where you could get into it with a random bozo in the bleachers, and he would turn out to be the head of the opposing team. “Mid-season, that’s when we really caught fire,” AJ told me. “It was all over the blogs and hockey-fight sites, the craziness. There was an incident where one of our players attacked one of the Adirondack coaches, and that ended up in the Toronto Star. People were like, ‘What the hell’s going on over there?’ And they’d do some research and see how young I was, and the father–son dynamic and the type of fighters. It started becoming urban legend.” The 2004–05 UHL season coincided with the NHL lockout. Having failed to agree with players on a new contract, major-league owners canceled the season. Typical New York Rangers or New York Islanders fans were in the position of heroin addicts who’d lost their supply—which is how they found their way to the Trashers. And fans weren’t the only ones who found the Trashers; players did too. The lockout sent NHL stars into the cold. Many signed with the American Hockey League, the league directly below the NHL, pushing AHL players down to teams in the UHL. “There was a tremendous infusion of talent,” Christiansen said. The Trashers were even able to land a few genuine NHL players, one of whom was Mike Rupp. At 24, Rupp had already spent two seasons in the majors. In the spring of 2003, while playing for the New Jersey Devils, Rupp had scored a game-winning goal in the Stanley Cup finals. Now he was turning up with his gear at a regional airport, being greeted too enthusiastically by what looked like a high-school kid claiming to be his new GM. Rupp played 14 games for the Trashers—racking up five goals, five assists, and 30 penalty minutes—before going back to the NHL for nine more seasons. Every great team needs a great rival. The New York Yankees have the Boston Red Sox; the Chicago Bears, the Green Bay Packers. The Trashers had the Adirondack Frostbite. The closest team to Danbury, the Frostbite played in Glens Falls, New York, just three hours away by luxury coach. They were the cream of the UHL, one of its best teams and a pet project of hockey celebrities: The franchise was owned in part by the former NHL coach Barry Melrose and the ESPN broadcaster Steve Levy. The rivalry between the teams developed fast. Two months into the season, the games turned nasty. Danbury’s equipment manager would soak the Trashers’ jerseys in Crisco before they played the Frostbite so the opposing goons couldn’t get a firm grip. Some fights started spontaneously, following a big hit. Others started formally, proposed and accepted in the way of czarist-era duels: One morning, as AJ was driving to school—he was by then a freshman at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, New York, a 40-minute commute from New Fairfield—he heard Barry Melrose talking smack about the Trashers on ESPN Radio. “He took a shot at us,” AJ told me. “I remember being so pissed, I had to do something. So I reached out to a guy I knew in the Quebec League and said, ‘Get me Chad Wagner.’ ” Chad Wagner was one of the most feared hockey fighters of the era. He had once set a record in the West Coast Hockey League with 503 penalty minutes in a single season. Wagner generally played on one- or two-game contracts, and promised AJ that he would take care of the Frostbite. At a home game in Danbury, “he beat up three Adirondack forwards,” AJ said. “It turned into a brawl. He ended up reaching over the bench and grabbing the Adirondack coach, trying to pull him over the boards. He was suspended from the UHL for life.” And then there was the “broken-leg game.” People who tell the story start with the date, as if recalling an event of historical importance: December 1, 2004. The Trashers were hosting the Kalamazoo Wings, and Brent Gretzky was being shadowed by the Kalamazoo defenseman Josh Elzinga. Brad Wingfield—“Wingnut”—challenged Elzinga:Drop ’em; let’s get it on. Elzinga refused. But as Wingnut moved away, Elzinga stuck out his skate and grabbed Wingnut’s jersey. Wingnut went down awkwardly, and a crack could be heard in every part of the arena: Wingnut’s left tibia and fibula.ESPN The Magazinereported that one onlooker described Wingnut as “on all fours, like an animal braying for help.” He’d be out the rest of that season, and half of the next. The game turned into a riot, everyone taking a run at everyone else. “Rumun Ndur ended up seeing red and going batshit crazy,” AJ told me. “He allegedly kicked a referee. He got suspended.”  As James Harper, a veteran minor-league linesman, was talking with the scorekeeper, he got into it with Jimmy Galante, who’d come down from the owner’s box. “I wound up having words with the referee, and unbeknownst to me, he was a full-time police officer in upstate New York,” Galante told me. “I took a swing at him. He had me arrested in the locker room. It was a big to-do.” Although Galante claims that he never actually made contact,he was charged with assault. (Prosecutors ultimately dropped the case for lack of proof.) According to ESPN, an FBI wiretap that was capturing Galante’s phone calls would later reveal that three days after Wingnut broke his leg, Galante asked his business associate Ciro Viento to call Commissioner Brosal. (Galante denies having had this conversation.) The issue was a letter he wanted Harper to send the commissioner, absolving Galante: “Tell him that it is fucking imperative that we get that letter that … Harper’s gonna write to Brosal.” Galante added what the referee should say in the letter: “ ‘After coolin’ off and thinking about it for a few days … I was just as much at fault.’ ” Harper never sent such a letter, but another wiretap captured Viento on the phone with Brosal: “I was asked to give you a call, but not to give you a call, so that you would never be put in the predicament where somebody said that you were called.” (Brosal denied any effort at coercion.) The Trashers finishedthe 2004–05 season with a 44–29–7 record, which put them in the playoffs. In many ways, the first round of that postseason was the high point: the Trashers versus the Frostbite, best of seven. A violent, brutal melee from start to finish. “You have to understand,” Dave Mac Isaac, who played 62 regular-season games for Danbury, told me. “We were maybe the toughest team to ever play this game. The most famous tough-guy team ever was who—the Broad Street Bullies, ’74–’75 Flyers? They had, what, three goons? We had 10 goons! What does that mean? We play a team like the Frostbite, a team with maybe two goons. Their goons fight our goons. All get tossed. Guess what? We still got eight goons.” Game Two is what people remember. Many Trashers players—now scattered in office complexes and neighborhood rinks across North America—speak of this as the greatest night of their hockey life. The game was still knotted after two overtimes. The Trashers sprawled in the locker room as the Zamboni worked. Between periods, players take off their jersey and pads. When the signal comes, they pull on a fresh shirt, put on the gear, head out. But by 1 a.m., the Trashers were out of fresh shirts. It wasn’t a crisis, but it was a drag. No one likes to put on wet clothes. Danbury fans who’d followed the team to Glens Falls got word of the situation and gave the players the shirts off their own backs. Could there be a better symbol of the link between fans and team? The winning goal came in the third overtime. “I was on the bench,” Doug Christiansen told me. “I remember being elated, guys tumbling over the boards like we’d won the Stanley Cup.” The Trashers went on to win that series, but lost the next. By the second round, they had nothing left. In professional sports, there are usually two games taking place. The first happens on the field, court, or ice. The second goes on in the front office: signing players, making trades. But for the Trashers, there was a third game, although neither Jimmy nor AJ knew about it. It was happening at the FBI’s office in New Haven, where, by the spring of 2005, a handful of agents were deep into an investigation of Galante’s garbage business. According to the subsequent indictment, the investigation was part of an effort to thwart “illegal practices in the trash hauling industry.” It had been kicked off by a complaint. Someone had said Galante, with a near-monopoly on regional garbage collection, was driving out competitors. The FBI had sent an agent undercover to pass himself off as a rogue salesman and befriend the men around Galante. Within weeks, the agent was seated beside the boss himself in the owner’s box at the Danbury Ice Arena, cheering as the Trashers skated out. The U.S. Attorney’s office learned enough to get wiretaps and, eventually, search warrants. The wiretaps captured Galante’s associates recalling a trip to Mount Kisco, New York, where they went—as Michael Gustafson, the lead assistant U.S. attorney who handled the case, would later state in court—“to retain the services of a leg-breaker known as the Carpenter.” Also caught on tape was Galante telling an associate to deliver a message to a would-be canary: “Long Island says hello,” referring to Matty the Horse Ianniello. Gustafson would later describe Galante as “a manipulating, controlling, hands-on bully.”  When I asked Galante why he’d become a fixation for prosecutors, he said, “I have no idea. Maybe because I’m Italian and in the garbage business.” In the summer of 2005, federal agents raided Galante’s offices, coming away with more than $500,000 in cash and more than 5,000 boxes of documents—receipts, account books, you name it. In this way, they happened across, in addition to all sorts of other malfeasance, evidence of those no-show jobs, which ultimately resulted in additional charges against Galante. There was something else in the books too. According to the indictment, Galante was making quarterly payments of $30,000 to Matty the Horse, the successor to Vincent the Chin Gigante and the boss of the Genovese crime family. Galante’s payments were characterized as a “mob tax” to ensure his companies’ primacy in the trash trade. It was a twist Elmore Leonard might have considered improbable. A case involving a minor-league hockey team also nailed Matty the Horse. In 1980, after the Houston Oilers barely missed a trip to the Super Bowl, Coach Bum Phillipsgave their fans a famous pep talk. “One year ago we knocked on the door,” he said. “This year we beat on the door. Next year we’re going to kick the son of a bitch in!” It was like that with the Trashers. They’d gotten close in 2005; now they intended to kick the son of a bitch in. The team was largely the same, with a few additions, including yet another minor-league-hockey legend, David Beauregard. “AJ and I would stand up there and look at the teams that were coming to play us,” Galante told me. “We would yell down during warm-ups, ‘Come on, you’re going to be skating for us next year!’ And they’d look at me and rub their fingers, and I’d reach in my pocket and pull out my wallet, and they’d start laughing.” “Beauregard was one of my favorites,” AJ said. “First year, he was playing for the Port Huron Beacons, killing us. He wore a full face mask. I remember asking, ‘Why does he have the full mask?’ Someone told me, ‘He’s only got one eye.’ ”He’d lost vision in the other—a stick through the visor. The injury barred him from the NHL, so he was down among the minor-league rabble. “The second year, Port Huron became the Roanoke Valley Vipers. And he’d still kill us,” AJ went on. “It was one of those things where we’d say, ‘Hit this guy.’ But no one could catch him. Toward the trade deadline, we were going through a slump. My dad wasn’t too happy, and in so many words I was told, ‘We need a fucking scorer.’ I was on spring break from college, and my break consisted of me in my room researching … I didn’t really have any relationships with other hockey people. So I’m like, ‘How the hell am I going to get a trade?’ I ended up taking this Vipers fan booklet and calling the merchandise number. There was no other number. Somehow they got the message upstairs. They called back, and I said, ‘Do you want to trade that one-eyed guy?’ His first game with us, he had [a goal and an assist]. He was unreal down the stretch.” The Trashers finished their second season 48–17–11, then rolled through the playoffs, making it all the way to the finals, where they lost to Kalamazoo in five games. But for many, the highlight had come earlier in the season, when Wingnut got his revenge. He was just back from that broken leg when the Wings came to Danbury. The result wasa kind of frontier justice. He caught Josh Elzinga in a corner, called him out, beat him down. Asked how the payback made him feel, Wingnut said great, “but I would have liked to have seen him leaving the ice on a stretcher or in a body bag.”  Jimmy Galantewas arrested on June 9, 2006, not long after the final game of the season. In the indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney’s office, Galante was charged with 72 counts, including extortion, witness tampering, and racketeering. He’d been named with several others, including Trashers Coach J. Todd Stirling, who pleaded guilty to taking part in the salary-cap fraud. In court, Matty the Horse was ruined and old, hard to understand. After he was released on $1 million bond, he was asked whether he had any comment. The gangster shrugged: “What can I say, right? Nothing.” Matty the Horse spent 18 months in the big house, but he survived it, dying a free man in August 2012.Jimmy pleaded guiltyto racketeering conspiracy, tax fraud, and wire fraud. The government seized most of his assets, including 25 trash companies and a string of race cars. He spent six years in Allenwood, a federal penitentiary in central Pennsylvania. The Trashers folded three days after Galante’s arrest. AJ called it a coincidence: Changes in the league made continued play impossible, he said, not “the legal problem.” Of course, his dad’s arrest played a role. “The United States government came in and seized my assets, and one of the assets was the team,” Galante told me. Maybe it was better that way. No slow dissipation for the Trashers, no aging and decline. Just two unforgettable seasons sealed in amber. In 2015, AJ opened a boxing club across from the Danbury arena. He named it Champs Boxing Club & Fitness. That’s where he told me his story, amid the light and heavy bags, in the regulation ring. He’s working to turn Danbury into a boxing mecca—up there “with Oxnard, California.” Galante got out of prison in 2014. Asked what he’s up to these days, he said, “Enjoying life.” The Danbury arena, meanwhile, has returned to its old existence as a youth rink. My son plays there eight or nine times a year. I sit in Section 102 and let the other parents have it.

Let’s say you receive an unexpected financial windfall. What’s the first thing you’re spending money on? If it’s a lavish vacation—how are you getting there? Americanstop the listof consumers who say they’re interested in private travel, so there’s a clue. Many of us would prefer to opt out of thecommercial-flight experience, but the odds of hailing a private jet are lottery-long for anyone not in the 1 percent. Still, that doesn’t mean that commercial flying is devoid of its own cutthroat class system.  As with life at ground level, social mobility in the sky is secured by money and a slew of secondary considerations, like “loyalty,” that also mean money. The majority of us find ourselves on the bottom rung—the main cabin, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the seats on a Boeing 737. And airlines don’t let us forget it. Every boarding-zone call registers our lowly station, sorting passengers with all the sensitivity of industrial farm equipment. Every full overhead bin mocks our sad aftward shuffle past first or business class. On occasion, some of us get to ride the company card to relative comfort, but when you’re flying on your own dime, you’re more than likely facing the bald reality of economy seat 28F.  Or maybe, just maybe, you reach a little deeper into your pocket and cough up the bones to relocate to aslightlysexier neighborhood: premium economy. Though not as plush as a business-class berth, premium (which goes by different names depending on the airline) delivers various creature comforts—a few extra inches of legroom, or a toiletry kit with Malin+Goetz products, or a “chef-inspired” meal with craft beer, to name a few perks across carriers. In recent years, an emerging subset of fliers has signaled enthusiasm for premium economy’s marginally more refined service. “One of the trends that everyone in the airline industry is talking about nowadays, especially coming out of the pandemic, is a greater willingness on the part of leisure travelers to buy a premium economy seat,” Rob Britton, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and a former managing director of American Airlines, told me. Business travel, airlines’ usual bread and butter, fell off a cliff in 2020, and these companies now see a lifeline in Millennial yuppies. “The 35-year-old couples going to Paris are filling the gap.” In the mid-aughts, when a major aircraft manufacturer was designing a new model, it studied the cost per square-inch of real estate in the most expensive markets: New York, Paris, London. Then it looked at the cost per square-inch on airplanes. There was no comparison, Uzma Khan, a marketing professor at the University of Miami, told me. “From an airline’s perspective, what is the most expensive thing for them to give you? Real estate in the air.” In that regard, airlines operate as a kind of landlord, calculating the expense of hurtling a single passenger from one place to another and adding a healthy upcharge on top.  Historically the seats in the front of the plane subsidized operations, as besuited flyers from the likes of Bain and Deloitte and Baker Mc Kenzie reliably bought more expensive business-class tickets. Still, carriers clung to thin margins. And in 2008, rising fuel costs and sagging demand prompted airlines to decouple standard amenities from economy tickets in order to keep their prices competitive. Over time, they made it up not just by selling credit-card miles, corporate contracts, and cargo, but also by using premium economy to sell the faint whiff of pampering to vacationers like Kelsey Masters, a project manager who lives in New York.  By her own admission, Masters is terrified of flying, but she makes frequent cross-country trips to see friends and family. She described her purchase habits to me with a weary acceptance that characterizes her overall feelings on pandemic air travel: “Screw it. Sixty bucks to upgrade? I get a little more legroom and a free drink, and I can just be a little more calm? That sounds like a really good thing right now.” Rather than splurge in the planning stage, she tries to buy the cheapest fare ahead of time and let the circumstances of the travel day guide her upgrade decisions. Compounding stressors from the airport, the trip itself, or even a few nights of fitful sleep on a friend’s living-room pullout “will make me start to reevaluate the opportunity cost of the dollar,” she said.  Premium economy has become a major revenue driver for the airlines, which, according to Counterpoint Market Intelligence, an aerospace market research company, are projected to triple their inventory of premium seats by 2025. But travelers like Masters weren’t the original target. Britton explained that premium economy wasn’t built to entice strivers across flight-class lines; carriers originally designed it to catch the bruised egos of former business-class members when the corporate world began to earnestly self-audit and downgrade employee travel budgets. A recent report by Jay Sorensen, an industry consultant, noted that “the apparent discovery of a new type of upscale leisure traveler” is a welcome surprise for these airlines. It connoted a small miracle: Airlines had once again wrung a new social class from flying, as they had done with first and business class. And they were able to do it, in part, because of a phenomenon called “pain of payment.”  According to Khan, people often experience “actual, physical pain” upon paying for something. But humans can have short memories. If airlines create enough distance between the initial ticket purchase and the option to upgrade, passengers are more likely to think of the latter as a stand-alone cost. “A lot of upgrades happen because now you’re either at the airport, or you’re checking in, and they give you an option. You don’t even remember exactly how much you paid for your flight when you were booking it, so that pain is gone,” Khan said. Basically, you don’t consider the total amount because you’ve already internalized the initial amount.  At the point of travel, an extra $45 or so to improve ashort-haul flight—however modestly—doesn’t seem so decadent, especially when the threat of suffering through basic economy looms. Back in 2014, the antitrust scholar Tim Wu coined the phrasecalculated miseryto describe the conditions of basic economy, positing that airlines deliberately provide substandard service to coerce customers into paying for amenities that previously were free—seat selection, checked baggage, and itinerary changes, for instance. “It’s just a matter of physical discomfort translating into an emotional debt,” says Wesley Kang, a co-founder of Nimble Made, an e-commerce clothing brand, who flies frequently for leisure and family visits. “The less you move around, the less you have to adjust, the less inconsiderate you’re being to the person next to you.”  There is, of course, another prevailing opinion about premium economy, which is that it’s simply a ham-fisted attempt to get passengers to pay more for a negligibly better experience. This attitude puts the pomp and puffery of premium economy into sharp relief. A seat upgrade, after all, does not get you to your destination any more quickly or safely. Research bears that line of thinking out to an extent. Khan mentioned several studies that were conducted to determine the extent to which space colored the overall experience for passengers. An aircraft manufacturer brought in focus groups to try different seat configurations on its prototype, sometimes offering more legroom, sometimes more elbow room. “It had zero impact on customer satisfaction,” Khan said. “Where people do feel the difference is if you give them four more inches at the eye level. Because the perception of space is what matters.”  One could posit that the rise of premium economy was culturally foretold. The coveted Millennial-yuppie flier laying their claim to “nicer” seats falls in line with the idea that they’re bold go-getters who seekexperiences over things. Plus, the confluence of pandemic exhaustion, discretionary income, and the aforementioned “screw it” attitude toward purchasing small luxuries creates the perfect environment for low-stakes indulgence. Despite what travelers may know about seat-upgrade marketing tactics, many still think the extra spend is worth it. And perception is reality. Airlines, it turns out, have figured out how to bank on that fact.",2022-05-29T11:00:00Z,29.0,5.0,2022.0
95,Atlantic,Welcome to Time-Travel Thursdays,Adrienne LaFrance,"This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic’s archives to contextualize the present, surface delightful treasures, and examine the American idea.Sign up here. Human excellence can take many forms—electric-guitar solos, French braiding, organic chemistry, and the throwing of pizza dough all come to mind—but when it comes to predicting the future, our species is basically an embarrassment. People tend to have little self-awareness about the blinkers of their own presentism. They fear change. They are generally terrible at accurately determining risk. And their views are too often driven by emotion rather than empiricism or even well-informed instinct. A slightly more charitable assessment is that people actually are good at predicting the future—just less good at predicting when and howanyparticularfuturewill finally arrive. (The famous shorthand for this mismatch: “Where’s my jetpack?”) The passage of time has meant the emergence of an unintended genre of film and television that underscores this incongruity, in which past depictions of far-off futures are eventually revealed as off base. (Think Back to the Future II’s vision of 2015, filmed in the 1980s, now quickly receding into the past. Orany number of episodesof the original Twilight Zone.) One of the many things I love about The Atlantic, now in its 167th year of continuous publication, is that our archive is filled with centuries’ worth of imagined futures—the ones that materialized and those that very much did not (or at least haven’t yet). Ournewest newsletter, Time-Travel Thursdays,is a portal to these many past possible futures. Some weeks, we’ll shareone great storyfrom the vault. Other weeks, we’ll excavate a long-lost debate,mystery, or scandal, or trace the trajectory of a big idea across time. Over many generations, our writers have made predictions about, among other things, the impecuniosity ofthe American railways(1860); thedecline of the novel(1874); theworseningof the wealth gap (1879); the wholesalereplacementof human workers with machines (also 1879); the rise ofmodern meteorology(1880); the use of electricity totransmit photographsover great distances (1882); thecreationof audio books (1889); theendof musical criticism (1903); the need to affixairplane-landing docksto America’s skyscrapers (1921); and, conversely, the belief that air travelwould neverbe adopted by the masses (1928). In our pages people havemusedabout whether Paris would become “a halfhearted and second-rate New York” (1929); the future ofsuper-guerrilla warfare(1936); the“infinite faith in the future”required to fight against dictators for the future of democracy (1941); and the question ofwhether and howall life on Earth might be eliminated (1951).Atlanticwriters predicted thehyperlinked architectureof the web (1945), andadvances in surgerythat would make spare-parts banks for human organs as commonplace as auto-supply stores (1980). They have also suggested that someday soon everything will be made ofchickpeas(2019). Among the many considerations Atlanticwriters have given to the future, an old favorite of mine is the 1861essay“Concerning Future Years,” by the Scottish writer A. K. H. Boyd, who urges the reader to appreciate the precious and finite quality of their “one life, the slender line of blood passing into and passing out of one human heart.” In doing so, he contemplates the future not in terms of technological, political, or civilizational change, but on a simultaneously more intimate and universal level. (As was The Atlantic’s style at the time, the essay does not actually carry his byline, but Boyd is listed as the author in various accounts and indexes.) “Concerning Future Years” feels remarkably contemporary more than 160 years after it was first published. Boyd sees the future as something that an individual moves through time to reach, inextricably tied to the experience of living. He cautions against taking for granted even the most ordinary of life’s pleasures—the climbing of trees, the taking of walks, the presence of a child making daisy chains. “In this world there is no standing still,” he writes. “And everything that belongs entirely to this world, its interests and occupations, is going on towards a conclusion. It will all come to an end … Many men of an anxious turn are so eagerly concerned in providing for the future, that they hardly remark the blessings of the present. Yet it is only because the future will some day be present, that it deserves any thought at all.” I’m drawn to Boyd’s essay, 19th-century lilt and all, in part because I am a sap when it comes to earnest acknowledgments of the good luck we are given with every new second of every new day—but also because it orients the reader toward the reason for the cultural obsession with time travel in the first place, a preoccupation that I share: that is, we are all time travelers, moving through our lives and through history, bearing witness to forces of tremendous change much greater than we are, mostly oblivious to the malleable quality of time even as it bends around us, far more connected to the individuals who came before us than we sometimes realize. When you stop to contemplate the sweep of what’s changed, and study the history of ideas, you inevitably find a connection through time—and perhaps through the pages of a very old magazine—to the travelers who have come before. And in doing this you will find you are sometimes lucky enough to receive unexpected wisdom and insight from another age. Or at the very least, a swell of gratitude for the people and world around you, just as they are right now.",2023-11-16T15:42:00Z,16.0,11.0,2023.0

Don't invent melodrama for the sake of it. Don't try to run, let alone fly, before you can walk with ease."" Every year he glared amiably at them. Every year they wrote melodrama. They clearly needed to write melodrama. He had given up telling them that creative writing was not a form of psychotherapy. In ways both sublime and ridiculous it clearly was precisely that.The class had been meeting for fifteen years. It had moved from a schoolroom to a disused Victorian church. The village was called Sufferacre, which was thought to be a corruption of Sulfuris Aquae. It was a failed Derbyshire spa. It was his home town. In the 1960s he had written a successfully angry, iconoclastic, and shocking novel called Bad Boy. He had left for London and fame, and returned quietly ten years later. He lived in a trailer in somebody's paddock. He traveled widely, on a motorbike, teaching creative writing in pubs, schoolrooms, and arts centers. His name was Jack Smollett. He was a big, shuffling, smiling, red-faced man, with longish blond hair, who wore cable-knit sweaters in oily colors and bright scarlet neckerchiefs. Women liked him, as they liked enthusiastic Labrador dogs. They almost all felt—and his classes were predominantly female—more desire to cook apple pies and Cornish pasties for him than to make violent love to him. They believed he didn't eat sensibly. (They were right.) Now and then someone in one of his classes would point out, as he exhorted them to stick to what they knew, that they themselves were whathe""really knew."" Will you write aboutus, Jack? No, he always said, that would be a betrayal of confidence. You should always respect other people's privacy.In fact he had tried unsuccessfully to sell two different stories based on the confessions (or inventions) of his class. The students offered themselves to him like raw oysters on pristine plates. They told him horror and bathos, daydreams, vituperation, and vengeance. They couldn't write; their inventions were crude, and he couldn't find a way to perform the necessary operations to spin the muddy straw into silk, or turn the raw, bleeding chunks into a savory dish. So he kept faith with them, not entirely voluntarily. He did care about writing. He cared about writing more than anything—sex, food, beer, fresh air, even warmth. He wrote and rewrote perpetually in his trailer. He was rewriting his fifth novel.Bad Boyhad been written in a rush just out of school and snapped up by the first publisher he'd sent it to. It was what he had expected. His second novel,Smile and Smile, had sold 600 copies, and was remaindered. His third and fourth, frequently rewritten, lay in brown paper, stamped and restamped, in a tin chest in the trailer. He didn't have an agent.Classes ran from September to March. In the summer he worked at literary festivals, or at holiday camps on sunny islands. He was pleased to see the classes again in September. He still thought of himself as wild and unattached, but he was a creature of habit. He liked things to happen at precise, recurring times, in precise, recurring ways. More than half the students in his classes were old faithfuls who came back year after year. Each class had a nucleus of about ten. At the beginning of the year this was often doubled by enthusiastic newcomers. By Christmas many of these would have dropped away—seduced by other courses, or intimidated by the regulars, or overcome by domestic drama or personal lassitude. St. Antony's Leisure Center was gloomy because of its high ceiling, and drafty because of its ancient doors and windows. The students had brought oil heaters, and standard lamps with imitation stained-glass shades. The old churchy chairs were pushed into a circle under these pleasant lights.He liked the lists of their names.

97,Atlantic,Jason Momoa’s Manliness Overwhelms SNLEsther Zuckerman11:18 AM ET,Esther Zuckerman,"When a Saturday Night Liveparody song begins, there’s usually a moment of anticipation where you wonder what the punch line is going to be. That was the case last night as a group of female cast members began a ballad about their aloof spouses, one wondering, “Is he dreaming of another woman he wants more than me?” Then the sketch cut to what the men were thinking. What was on their mind: The Roman empire, of course. Yes, it was maybe a couple of months delayed, but the rap song that ensued was about thememe that menare almost always pondering the details of the Roman empire. The night’s host, Jason Momoa, took the lead: “Five times a day it pops into my dome, which reminds me: They invented the dome. Just one of the reasons that I think about Rome.” With the burly Momoa, there to promote his latest turn as the DC superhero Aquaman,SNL’s writers had a paragon of muscle-bulging masculinity to deploy. The “Rome Song” sketch was just one of many where they used Momoa’s quintessential dudeness to offer some—sometimes amusing, sometimes overly simplistic—comedy on gender tropes. The Roman empire bit was the first one of the night that leaned into this theme. Momoa’s broad shoulders fit perfectly into a Roman warrior costume, but he was ultimately joined by the cast members Mikey Day and Kenan Thompson, who also spat out facts about gladiators and marble statues. The sketch had some other commentary on fixations. When it peeked into the brain of a little kid playing the son of Momoa and Ego Nwodim, the boy began to rap about dinosaurs. And as for the women? Well, women are always dwelling on astrology, which led Momoa to point out that “the Romans were actually into astrology too.” As a whole, the sketch was well executed—the “dinosaur” interlude was a particularly cute addition—but it offered nothing new by way of commentary on the meme, which at this point has already been played out across social media. Plus, there’s nothing really subversive about saying, essentially, that men obsess over history while women look at their horoscopes. In fact, it’s a little reductive. The episode did not get all that more insightful as it went on. Later, Momoa played the hunky ex-fiancé of a woman portrayed by Chloe Fineman. She had thought him dead after a plane explosion, but he returned from being stranded on an island sexier than ever, much to the dismay of her new spouse (Andrew Dismukes). She was smitten, and it was an easy gag, a showcase of Momoa’s strong, wild-man persona and not much more. But perhaps the night’s strangest take on gender came near the end of the show. In a riff on Netflix’s Untolddocumentary series, Sarah Sherman appeared as the fictional tennis player Charna Lee Diamond, who, in this version, had a battle-of-the-sexes tournament before Billie Jean King did. Except Charna wasn’t so successful. She challenged a man to a match and got paired up with Momoa as Ronnie Dunster, who “at the time was the largest man to ever play tennis.” That’s where it verged into absurdism. When Ronnie served, the ball literally went through Charna, leaving a bleeding hole in the center of her stomach. She screamed, “Did I ruin it for women?” She pressed on. Her head came off with his second serve. Charna tried to change history and died doing it. The gross-out gruesomeness of the sketch distinguished it, but it was ultimately just another reminder of how big Momoa is, and, in turn, how manly. The underlying sentiment: Come on, a girl can’t beatthatguy. Many hosts arrive on SNLeager to subvert their public persona and show their comedic range. Momoa threw himself into the sketches with verve, but he didn’t take a lot of risks to challenge his image, and neither did the writers. With Momoa as an emblem of huge male energy, they dove headfirst into tired binaries.",2023-11-19T16:18:05Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlanticwriter reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Conor Friedersdorf, a staff writer and the author of our Up for Debatenewsletter. Conor is dreaming about a Golden Girlsreboot starring the Friendscast, reflecting on a poignant but hilarious one-man show from America’s “Roastmaster General,” and wasting time by playing chess on his phone. First, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic: The Culture Survey: Conor Friedersdorf An actor I would watch in anything:Once upon a time, I would have answered Paul Newman. I’ve long since seen everything he ever made. Then, after watching Deadwood, I thought that I’d watch Timothy Olyphant in anything––so I started watching his portrayal of Raylan Givens, on Justified. But after watching Walton Goggins portray Boyd Crowder on that same show, my new answer is that I’d watch Walton Goggins in anything.[Related:Justified:a neglected rebel amid television’s golden age] The upcoming event I’m most looking forward to:It’s premonitions of as-yet-undeclared projects that excite me––a feature-length Paul Walker return in a hypothetical Fast13 or 14 that advancing AI makes almost inevitable; the Golden Girlsreboot with Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel in retirement. My favorite blockbuster and favorite art movie:Although wildly different in so many ways,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the Paul Newman and Robert Redford classic, and The Great Beauty, directed by Paolo Sorrentino, both probe, with a keen sense of humor and strikingly gorgeous cinematography, the question of how we ought to live. Best novel I’ve recently read, and the best work of nonfiction:On Beauty, by Zadie Smith, who excels at writing novels as much as she does writing essays, and the unimaginably ambitious From Dawn to Decadence,by Jacques Barzun. Authors I will read anything by:Raymond Chandlerand Caitlin Flanagan. A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: “These Arms of Mine,” by Otis Redding,and“Good Vibrations,” by the Beach Boys. A musical artist who means a lot to me:Although renowned for his Hollywood scores, Randy Newman is highly underrated as a solo artist.[Related:Why Randy Newman is America’s foremost musical satirist] The last museum or gallery show that I loved:The historian and curator Richard Rabinowitz once walked me through his “Slavery in New York” exhibit at the New-York Historical Society, and it really stuck with me. A piece of visual art that I cherish:My late grandfather, a carpenter by trade, designed and built his own house in the late 1960s, then began producing oil paintings until all of the empty wall space was filled––at which time he stopped painting! A cultural product I loved as a teenager and still love:The Miseducation of Lauryn Hillholds up.[Related:The complicated female genius of Lauryn Hill] Something I recently revisited:Bygone Norm Macdonald appearances on TV and radio. A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic:“New York After Paris,” from the October 1906 issue. My favorite way of wasting time on my phone:The chess.com app. An online creator that I’m a fan of:Andrew Schulz and all of the other talented comedians who made it by becoming undeniable among their fans rather than by getting an early nod from industry gatekeepers. Something delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life:Dug Days, recommended for audiences of all ages. The last debate I had about culture:I was contending that Dom in the Fast & Furiousfranchise would have been a Modelo drinker rather than a Corona drinker.[Related:Fast & Furiousand pretty stale] A good recommendation I recently received:The 2008 drama The Baader Meinhof Complex, and a short film,Pony, directed by Candice Carella about a rock star babysitting his niece, played by Miko Nakano, who steals the show. The last thing that made me cry:If getting teary-eyed counts, then the last time was at the Village Underground, in New York City, watching America’s “Roastmaster General,” Jeff Ross, recount the history of his family in Take a Banana for the Ride. The poignant details were all the more impressive in the context of a one-man show that had me laughing as hard and often as in any stand-up set. The last thing that made me snort with laughter:The Huell Howserepisodethat features the avocado-eating dog always gets me.

99,Atlantic,An Unlikely Source of Greenhouse-Gas Emissions Kylie Mohr8:00 AM ET,Kylie Mohr,"This article was originally published by High Country News. Chunks of carbon-rich frozen soil, or permafrost, undergird much of the Arctic tundra. This perpetually frozen layer sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, sometimes storing it for tens of thousands of years beneath the boggy ground. The frozen soil is insulated by a cool wet blanket of plant litter, moss, and peat. But if that blanket is incinerated by a tundra wildfire, the permafrost becomes vulnerable to thawing. And when permafrost thaws, it releases the ancient carbon, which microbes in the soil then convert into methane—a potent greenhouse gas whose release contributes to climate change and the radical reshaping of northern latitudes across the globe. Researchpublished last month in Environmental Research Letters, a scientific journal, found that methane hot spots on the tundra are more likely to be found in places where wildfires burned recently. The study focused on Alaska’s largest river delta, the Yukon-Kuskokwim, an area previously identified as emitting large amounts of methane. A team of scientists with NASA’s ABo VE project (Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment), which studies environmental change in Alaska and western Canada, were curious about the cause of those methane hot spots, which were observed using aerial surveys in 2017. So the study’s lead author, Elizabeth Yoseph, an intern at the time, overlaid maps of those areas with recent fire activity. Her team found that the hot spots were almost 30 percent more likely to occur in areas that had experienced wildfire in the past 50 years than in unburned areas, a likelihood that jumped to nearly 90 percent if the fire’s perimeters touched water. Recently burned wetlands with especially carbon-rich soil had the highest ratio of hot spots. “Fires are an important influence on increasing emissions,” Yoseph says. The large-scale findings, which cover almost 700 square miles in Alaska, help complement field measurements, says Merritt Turetsky, an ecologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who was not involved in the research. “We really do need that glue between what’s happening on the ground and what we can detect from satellite images,” she says. The aerial surveys help scientists understand the expansive tundra, where field research is limited by road networks that tend to avoid marshy terrain. The effects of thawing permafrost spread far beyond the far North. Wildfire’s impact on frozen permafrost propels a climate feedback loop: Wildfires release methane, which accelerates climate change, which causes more frequent wildfires—and repeat. Tundra fires are still relatively rare but could increase due to warming temperatures and more lightning activity. Some projections indicate that wildfires in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta could quadruple by the end of the century. Without tall trees for flames to climb, tundra fires tend to creep slowly on the ground, smoldering for months and sometimes even going underground, only to reemerge later. Given the amount of carbon frozen beneath the Arctic soil, the potential consequences are enormous. Arctic permafrost is a gigantic repository, storing an estimated 1,700 billion metric tons of carbon. That’s over 50 times more than all of the carbon released as global fossil-fuel emissions in 2019. “We all need to get invested in these big episodic releases of greenhouse gases if we want to bring our climate future under some kind of certainty,” Turetsky says. Evidence suggests that portions of the tundra are transforming from a carbon sink into a carbon (and methane) source. “Wildfires are certainly not helping,” she says. “That’s a big deal. It’s a tipping point.”",2023-11-19T13:00:00Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
100,Atlantic,The Other Ozempic Revolution Helen Lewis7:30 AM ET,Helen Lewis,"On Labor Dayweekend, 35 excited guests arrived at a campground in Newark, Ohio, for a retreat dedicated to “fat joy”—a place where people could swim, dance, do yoga, roast marshmallows, and sleep in cabins with others who had been made to feel guilty about their weight. The point of Camp Round Up was “really diving into the joy of being at summer camp, the joy of being a fat little kid again,” Alison Rampa, one of the organizers, told me. She and a friend, Erica Chiseck, had created Camp Round Up to counter the shame and stigma that fat Americans report experiencing because of their size. They wanted to establish somewhere that “ladies and theydies” could feel comfortable in shorts or a swimsuit, with no awkwardness in the lunch line over portion sizes or second helpings. But even somewhere as body-positive as Camp Round Up couldn’t avoid a subject that has captivated the American media and divided couples, communities, and friendship groups. At a session called “Compassionate Conversations,” someone eventually said the word:Ozempic—the best-known name in a class of new weight-loss drugs. At Camp Round Up, the discussion began with bariatric surgery, a more established medical intervention. But the conversation quickly drifted toward Ozempic. “A couple of the girls were talking about how either they had been on it or they had been offered it by their doctor,” Chiseck told me. “They were just all sharing horror stories, basically,” Rampa told me. Known generically as semaglutide, the drug causes nausea and other side effects in some patients, a fact that Rampa found “triggering.” It meant that people “are voluntarily making themselves ill—to not look like us.” Spend any time in communities dedicated to weight and Ozempic, however, and you will also hear about the opposite experience. Kristen Hall, 52, a member of Reddit’s Ozempic forum who has taken semaglutide since May, told me she felt stigmatized by those whodidn’twant medication. As her weight loss became apparent, some of her friends peppered her with questions. “These were not questions asked out of curiosity,” she said via email. “I heard nothing but judgment in their voices … The ironic thing is that it wasn’t the naturally thin friends that I felt judged me (they were happy for me), it was the friends who ALSO struggled with their weight and/or had disordered eating. Like I was cheating.” So far, much of the news coverage of Ozempic and similar drugs has focused on whether they work—and what their side effects might be. But the real story will begin when this emergent form of treatment becomes utterly routine, as it almost certainly will. Most people in America, the richest country in the world, are fat. Almost three-quarters of adults older than 20 live withobesityoroverweight. And given the popularity of existing weight-loss treatments, we can deduce that most ofthosepeople would rather not be fat. The consequences of the Ozempic revolution will be economic and social, as well as medical. The new drugs will transform people’s relationship with eating—and with one another. Ever since aseries ofstudiesshowedsemaglutide’s effectiveness for weight loss, Novo Nordisk has developed a problem. The Danish company simply cannot make enough Ozempic and Wegovy—its other brand name for the drug. In September, Novo Nordiskovertookthe luxury-goods retailer LVMH to become Europe’smost valuable company. Its market capitalization—an estimated $450 billion as of Friday—was higher than Denmark’s annual GDP. Originally approved to treat diabetes, semaglutide falls intoa category of drugs, called GLP-1 agonists, that slow digestion, control blood-sugar levels, and suppress the appetite. Other pharmaceutical companies are now joining the gold rush by introducing their own GLP-1 agonists. On November 8, the American firm Eli Lilly got FDA approval for Zepbound, a weight-loss version of its diabetes drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide). The potential market is enormous: In Europe,59 percentof adults qualify as overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. (Throughout this article, I have used interviewees’ preferred terms. Although doctors have moved toward terms such asliving with overweight, some activists like the unapologetic nature offat.) In China, obesity ratestripledfrom 2004 to 2018. Overall, analysts estimate that by the end of the decade, GLP-1 agonists could be worth $100 billion a year worldwide. After decades of helping clients laboriously control their calories, Weight Watchers has already conceded defeat, acquiring atelehealth companyto dispense semaglutide alongside its established diet—sorry, “wellness”—plans. Chris Edson, who runs the British weight-loss-support start-up Second Nature, has made a similar pivot. “A lot of our narrative was: no drugs; we’re going to help you do this through behavioral science alone,” he told me. “And I remember pitching venture-capitalist investors and them saying,Have you seen this thing in the States?” The investors were talking about semaglutide, and that prompted Edson to look into the available research. “And then I completely changed my mind,” he said. Second Nature now offers straightforward lifestyle support, as well as supportplussemaglutide—at least, as much of the drug as it can, given the supply shortages. Spend any time in online weight-loss forums, and you will hear ecstatic reactions to the new drugs. “The first shot I took, I was cured of all the food noise that was siphoning off my mental energy,” one 35-year-old New Yorker told me, adding that she had gone from 247 pounds to 200 pounds since starting Ozempic in February. Her knees hurt less, she said; she was more focused on spending time with her friends instead of thinking about food, and she felt less “invisible.” (Many of the people I interviewed had positive experiences with semaglutide. But I was struck by how many requested anonymity to discuss their decision to take the drug, its effect on their personal relationships, or both.) Not everyone who struggles with weight will benefit from the drug. Some people have insurers that won’t cover it. Others find the results underwhelming or the side effects intolerable. “One minute I would be fine, and the next minute I would be talking to Ralph on the big white phone,” former British Prime Minister Boris Johnsonwrotein June, in typically lurid prose. “I am afraid that I decided that I couldn’t go on.” The plus-size influencer Remi Badersaidin January that after she stopped using Ozempic, she binged her way to a higher weight than before. The Ozempic revolution is, therefore, also creating an Ozempic divide. Until now, very few people living with obesity could lose enough weight, and maintain that loss, to satisfy their doctors. But now a gulf has opened up not just between naturally thin people and the plus sizers, butwithincommunities dedicated to larger people—whether those are groups for weight loss or body positivity. Do you take Ozempic or not? At the individual level, Ozempic and its sister drugs might also rewire millions of personal relationships, changing the dynamics of a family that has always had a “thin sister,” or a couple who bonded over a shared love of nachos and beer, or friends who stay in touch by sharing a restaurant meal. “I have quit drinking and my partner has not, and honestly, our relationship had a pretty strong foundation based on our shared love of wine and cocktails,” Kristen Holloway, 42, from Kansas City, Kansas, told me. (A lack of interest in alcohol is a widely reported side effect of semaglutide.) She hadn’t realized how much of their social life revolved around drinking. Even the couple’s in-jokes—such as a spoon rest that readstea is my daytime wine—were predicated on alcohol. “It’s been an adjustment, and we’re working through it,” Holloway said. Even many Ozempicenthusiasts are coy about disclosing why they’re looking slimmer. Nathan, a 41-year-old Redditor who asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss his medical history, told me that he lost 40 pounds on Rybelsus, another brand name for semaglutide. He began to notice that he could once again wear his favorite rings, button his collar, and cross his legs. His family and friends were supportive, as was his pastor, he told me via email. “Even at church, one of my priests saw me at the communion rail and she said: ‘This is the Body of Christ … BTW—you look great.’ Talk about validation.” But Nathan was still concerned about the wider reaction. “It seems like if the drug were used for diabetes, no one expressed any opposition. The moment weight loss became the goal, everyone had an opinion, and it was overwhelmingly hostile,” he said. “The general consensus was that it was a ‘cheat,’ a ‘shortcut,’ or the ‘easy way out.’” Notably, when Remi Baderspokeabout her experience with the drug, she said she had taken it because of “​​actual health issues.” The Reddit Ozempic forum has an explicit rule that states: “No posts pitting diabetic patients against weight loss only patients.” Not long after his pastor complimented his weight loss, Nathan received a text from a longtime female friend. He was on vacation, on a guided tour, and didn’t respond immediately. So the friend messaged again, Nathan recounted, “saying my silence and not texting her back fast enough was me thinking I was too important to talk to her. She actually said: ‘I’m so glad your life is getting fuller and you’re getting thinner, and now you want to cut me out of your life.’” They had never discussed his weight loss, or the methods he was using. “All I can figure is she saw my photos and side-by-sides on social media.” Nathan decided to block her number, reasoning that he cared more about his weight loss—and the health benefits it brought, such as reduced cholesterol and better sleep—than easing his friend’s hurt feelings. “It’s beyond ridiculous for her to act like this,” he said. “But as Samantha Jones said [on HBO’s Sex and the City]: ‘I love you, but I love me more.’” Envy was a drumbeat of many Ozempic stories that I heard, because guess what, lifeiseasier if you’re more conventionally attractive. “Being the chubby guy was part of my personality—my identity,” Tim, a British 40-something who asked to be identified only by his first name, told me. He had dropped from 224 pounds to 190, having been overweight since sustaining a sports injury as a teenager. He found that people were much more enthusiastic about talking to him, and he received far more attention from women at parties. “I always had the feeling of being outside everything, like there was a velvet rope.And there is.” These sentiments can be hard for Ozempic refusers to hear. Being fat is not like having high blood pressure, or cancer, or even athlete’s foot. Being fat has always meant living in a blizzard of other people’s opinions. And one of those opinions now is:Why don’t you just take Ozempic?Tigress Osborn, the executive director of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, is concerned that these drugs might roll back years of work by the fat-liberation movement, such as lobbyingtech companiesto provide more inclusive images in search results. She wants to warn people about “this narrative that weight loss is easy, anyone can do it, now there’s a magical pill; so if you’re not doing it, you deserve whatever happens to you.” In an interview, she ticked off ways in which people might be pressured to use the drugs and punished if they don’t: “Why don’t you just take that pill and lose weight, when your boss is not giving you the promotion because you’re too fat? Why don’t you just take that pill and lose weight, when your landlords are threatening to evict you because they say your footsteps are too heavy?” NAAFA believes in bodily autonomy—if you want to take Ozempic, the group doesn’t  judge—but argues that the current atmosphere is coercive. “We believe that in a culture that is so fat-hating, it’s not really an informed-consent choice to opt in to a drug like this,” Osborn told me. She also warned that even if the initial results from studies are borne out, and patients lose 20 percent of their body weight, many people “are still going to be fat, even if they lose the weight that the drug is promising them to lose.” Body-positivity communities, fat-liberation groups, and even informal support groups have been particularly challenged by Ozempic—as evidenced by the emergence of I’m only taking it for my diabetesdiscourse. Many of the disagreements are about the drugs’ long-term effectiveness. “I know how Atkins went,” Alison Rampa of Camp Round Up, who is firmly in the skeptic group, told me. “I know how South Beach went. I know howwhole foodswent. Yeah, I know how intermittent fasting went. I know how cleanses went; I know how Fiber Factorwent. I know how Slim Fast and Special K and uppers and cabbage soup—I know how all of them went.” She and Chiseck worry about people who cannot tolerate semaglutide, or cannot afford it, or just plain don’t want to tryanotherweight-loss solution after being burned before. On the other side are people like Chris Edson of Second Nature. After overcoming his own skepticism of semaglutide, he then had to win over everyone else in his business. His company was founded with the aim of getting people off diabetes drugs that have to be injected daily, by bringing down their blood sugar using behavioral interventions. For that reason, Edson’s decision to embrace weight-loss drugs alongside lifestyle changes was controversial with his employees. “We’ve had people leave as a result of it,” he told me. Personally, I’m an Ozempic optimist. I do not believe that Americans simply lost their willpower40 yearsago, when obesity rates began to climb. It seems more likely that our bodies, which evolved to navigate constant scarcity, are struggling to deal with the abundant calories and deliciously engineered food of the modern world. Our appetites push us toward sugar and fat, even if we have sedentary jobs. Semaglutide silences that mechanism. Talking with people who have taken Ozempic—many of whom note the reduction in “food noise”—is a revelation. Suddenly, they have the appetites of the naturally slender. Effortlessly thin people don’t have more willpower than the rest of us. Instead, they don’t need it.They don’t nobly refrain from another helping of cookies; they don’t even want to eat them in the first place. One of my interviewees told me that before she went on semaglutide, “the back of my mind was always focused on food:Should I eat the leftovers; should I order on Grubhub?” But even the new experience of self-restraint can be alienating. Kristen Holloway, who has lost 75 pounds since May last year, became “repulsed” by the Tik Tok cookery videos that her husband likes to watch. She also zoned out during a family discussion of restaurant recommendations: “I just found myself completely disengaged and thinking how weird it is to have a whole conversation like that—even though it’s probably not, really.” One of the most fascinating subplots in Ozempic discourse—and part of the reason that it’s tearing communities and even former friends apart—is the sheer amount of money involved. Each side suspects that the other is being hoodwinked by vested interests. “What we’re up against is the marketing budget of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk,” NAAFA’s Osborn said. “So of course, they get more media coverage. I can’t hire Queen Latifahto speak on behalf of my campaign.” On the other side, several Reddit forums I visited complained about what they saw as constant knee-jerk negativity by the media, for example in reporting every possible rare side effect, or even likening Ozempic to fen-phen—the drug withdrawn in 1997 because of its links to valvular heart disease. (Ozempic has reported no equally severe side effects, despite extensive clinical trials.) “The more rabid the opposition, the more I realized this drug might actually work,” Nathan told me. “I started to wonder, only somewhat tongue-in-cheek, who was so threatened? Big Fast Food? Big Bariatric? Big Pharma (that aren’t Novo Nordisk)? Big Gym? Big Fad Diet? Those only thrive if people stay overweight … and fail.” Rising rates of obesity have created two Americas. Most residents of the Republic of Thinness want to attribute their size to willpower and personal responsibility, rather than wealth or genetic luck. And if thinness is available to everyone, their social capital is devalued. In the Republic of the Fat, there is an unequal distribution of hope. Some people feel that the miracle they’ve been praying for is finally here, and they are glad to leave behind their identity as the “chubby friend” or the “gentle giant” and cross the border to Thinness. In turn, those who stay put feel doubly judged—by the thin people who always looked down on them, and by their former comrades who have now abandoned them. I asked Rampa and Chiseck whether anyone at Camp Round Up felt betrayed by those who took weight-loss drugs. “We would not feel betrayed by anybody who wants to choose to do whatever they want with their body,” Chiseck said. Equally, though, she expects that lack of judgment in return—even from Ozempic evangelists. “It’s my body. It’s no one else’s business. I’m not hurting anyone. The only one I’m truly hurting is the airplane creators that are making the seats smaller and smaller and telling me it’s my fault.” Gisela Salim-Peyer provided additional research.",2023-11-19T12:30:00Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
101,Atlantic,How the Hillbillies Remade America Max Fraser6:00 AM ET,Max Fraser,"On April 29, 1954, a cross section of Cincinnati’s municipal bureaucracy—joined by dozens of representatives drawn from local employers, private charities, the religious community, and other corners of the city establishment—gathered at the behest of the mayor’s office to discuss a new problem confronting the city. Or, rather, about 50,000 new problems, give or take. That was roughly the number of Cincinnati residents who had recently migrated to the city from the poorest parts of southern Appalachia. The teachers, police officials, social workers, hiring-department personnel, and others who gathered that day in April had simply run out of ideas about what to do about them. “Education does not have importance to these people as it does to us,” observed one schoolteacher. “They work for a day or two, and then you see them no more,” grumbled an employer. “Some don’t want modern facilities—if they have a bathtub, they don’t use it,” another meeting attendee claimed. And the charges they leveled only descended from there: “They let their children run wild.” They left their trash in the street and refused to go to the doctor. They misspent what little money they had. They fought and drank with abandon. Some were even rumored to disregard “laws here, such as it being a felony to have sexual relations with a member of their own family or with a girl who consents.” Marshall Bragdon, the long-serving executive director of an advisory commission to municipal government known as the Mayor’s Friendly Relations Committee, had conceived of this daylong “Workshop on the Southern Mountaineer in Cincinnati,” as the gathering was billed. Though he did not like what he heard, he was hardly surprised. A key objective of the workshop, Bragdon would explain, was to “de-stereotype the city man’s and urban agency’s views of and attitudes toward hill folks,” so that they might be better able to assist this growing population of poor rural newcomers to the city. As the litany of complaints poured forth during the workshop’s opening bull session, it was clear that there was much de-stereotyping to do. The 1954 Cincinnati workshop is a little-known episode in 20th-century American history, yet it would prove to be extraordinarily consequential. In its aftermath, municipal coalitions in a host of midwestern cities that were likewise on the receiving end of an influx of white migrants from the Appalachian South were inspired to take similar action. The workshop introduced new and influential ways of thinking about poverty in the postwar city, which would circulate broadly within liberal policy-making circles and, before long, would even come to shape the development of Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society. At the same time, the Cincinnati workshop also revealed a yawning cultural divide separating the middle-class professionals in attendance from the white working-class objects of their reform-minded concern, one that was replicated throughout the region and in Washington, and that would only grow deeper and wider over the decades to come. Although none of the workshop participants was overheard talking about a “basket of deplorables,” the resonance between their descriptions of their new hillbilly neighbors and that more recent political malapropism—which might have cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election—is unmistakable. Then, as now, liberalism found itself confronting a white working-class problem at least partially of its own creation. The sequence of events set in motion by the 1954 workshop offers important insights into our current political impasse—and into the lessons the modern Democratic Party has failed to learn for more than half a century. In the twodecades that followed World War II, when the great 20th-century migrations out of the rural South were at their zenith, the “hillbilly ghetto” appeared as a suddenly ubiquitous and more and more problematic feature on the landscape of the urban Midwest. In neighborhoods such as Over-the-Rhine and Lower Price Hill in Cincinnati, Uptown in Chicago, Stringtown in Indianapolis, Briggs and the Cass Corridor in Detroit—and in similar neighborhoods in smaller cities and towns across the region—growing clusters of poor southern white newcomers alarmed longer-term residents and amplified concerns about an onrushing crisis of the American inner city. Residents of these hillbilly ghettos, as they were commonly referred to by public officials and in media accounts at the time, stood out for their rural mannerisms and regionally alien cultural markings, for being, as Cincinnati’s director of health education put it, “different—different in speech, in dress, in culture, in habits and mores, in education, in social status, in work experience, and in health.” The neighborhoods themselves, meanwhile, were marked by rates of unemployment, housing insecurity, poverty-related medical issues, and crime and policing that more closely resembled predominantly Black urban neighborhoods such as Avondale, Paradise Valley, and Bronzeville than the postwar era’s growing middle-class suburbs. That the inhabitants of the hillbilly ghetto were white confounded many of their mid-century contemporaries, who struggled to reconcile them with their more familiar bigotries. “The so-called hillbillies, who now constitute a major slum problem in several midwestern cities … are about the only sizable group of white, Protestant, old-line Americans who are now living in city slums,” opined a columnist for Fortune. “The trouble with the latter, as with the rural Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans, is that they simply don’t know how to live in cities.” Marshall Bragdon may have felt more sympathetic to Cincinnati’s Appalachian migrants, but otherwise he largely agreed with that assessment. The 1954 workshop was intended to focus the city’s attention on what Bragdon called “the struggle for urban adjustment,” which, as he saw it, had left Cincinnati’s rural newcomers ill-prepared to succeed in the industrial city and was turning neighborhoods such as Over-the-Rhine and Lower Price Hill into intractable and dysfunctional pockets of poverty. Believing that most city agencies “don’t know how to help the migrants,” Bragdon invited Roscoe Giffin, a sociologist based at Berea College, in Kentucky, to help set the workshop attendees straight. In his talk, Giffin explained that the “pathological quality” of the city’s hillbilly ghettos could be attributed to a series of “culturally determined patterns of behavior which the Southern Mountaineers bring with them when they come to live north of the Ohio River”—among them a low regard for “formal education,” an instinctual emphasis on fulfilling “immediate” needs and desires, a “clannish” hostility toward outsiders, and a “fatalistic” resignation to present conditions. These behaviors, Giffin noted, had originated as natural and even rational adaptations to their impoverished rural circumstances. But they became counterproductive and self-defeating “when such people came to live around Liberty and Sycamore Streets of Cincinnati.” The solution, Bragdon and Giffin counseled the assembled city representatives, was time, understanding, and, above all, patient instruction in the expectations of modern urban society. “The basis of all human-relations work with all people,” Giffin reminded his audience, “is that you have first to accept them as they are before they are willing to modify their behavior.” The workshop proved to be a hit. The Cincinnati residents in attendance appreciated their new insights into the root causes of hillbilly pathology (“It gave me the positive side,” one social worker remarked; “my previous observations of them had been only on the negative”) and were further gratified to be reassured that it was the migrants’ behavior, and not the city itself, that was in need of “modification.” News of the workshop spread quickly through networks of municipal officials, and soon copycat workshops were being staged in other cities across the region, many featuring Roscoe Giffin as an invited speaker. “Urban adjustment,” meanwhile, became the prevailing paradigm for addressing the overlapping issues of migration, poverty, and inner-city decline. In 1957, Chicago created a Committee on New Residents—the first public body of its kind in the country—“based on a recognition of the adjustment problems presented by the migration to Chicago of Southern Whites, Negros, Puerto Ricans and American Indians seeking increased economic opportunity.” Detroit followed suit with its own Committee on Urban Adjustment shortly thereafter, designed “to try to change some of the values, attitudes, and behavior patterns … of the existing and continually arriving members of the rural lower class.” The Ford Foundation picked up on the urban-adjustment framework as well. Ford was then at the leading edge of the behavioral revolution in mid-century social-science research (its Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences opened at Stanford the same year the Cincinnati workshop was held), and Bragdon and Giffin’s focus on the more psychological and attitudinal ramifications of rural-to-urban migration struck a chord. Ford would agree to fund an expanded version of the Cincinnati workshop at Giffin’s home institution of Berea College in the summer of 1958, which brought representatives from seven midwestern cities down to Kentucky for three weeks to “study the mountaineer migrants in their native habitat.” The Berea workshop became, in the words of Ford’s Director of Public Affairs Paul Ylvisaker, “the first real entry point” for the foundation’s growing programmatic engagement with the complex of issues surrounding “community disorganization” and the unfolding urban crisis. The Berea workshop was restaged annually for the next nine years, during which time delegates from more than two dozen cities would attend. Subsequent initiatives spearheaded by Ylvisaker’s Public Affairs Division at the beginning of the 1960s, such as the Great Cities School Improvement Program and the Gray Areas Program, would funnel tens of millions in foundation dollars toward a variety of municipal efforts aimed largely at “citifying the in-migrant population” clustered in the country’s declining urban core. “I had the sense that we were dealing with people problems, not bricks and mortar and not power-structure problems so much, and that we were witnessing the vast migration into the central city—and I shifted at that point, to a concern with the migrant flows and what could be done about that,” Ylvisaker would reflect in a later interview. “Appalachia gave us a chance to touch off the concern with the whole process.” By the time Ylvisaker was tapped to sit on the White House’s Task Force on Poverty, convened in early 1964 to begin drafting the legislative foundations of a massive federal campaign to eliminate poverty, it was undeniable just how far and wide the ideas first introduced a decade earlier in Cincinnati had resonated. Ylvisaker’s Gray Areas Program—in its spatial focus on inner-city ghettos populated overwhelmingly by poor rural migrants, and in its programmatic emphasis on replacing deficient migrant cultures with more efficacious forms of “community action”—was the clearest prototype for what became the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, signed into law by Johnson that August. “A lot of the ideas that ended up actually in the legislation,” noted William Capron, who worked on the task force with Ylvisaker and oversaw domestic spending in Johnson’s Bureau of the Budget, “really were developed out of the Ford experience.” As unlikely as it may have seemed when Bragdon first convened his skeptical colleagues in the spring of 1954, the hillbilly ghetto had helped set in motion a series of events that had culminated in the enactment of one of postwar liberalism’s most ambitious social-policy experiments. There werealways other ways to think about the issue of urban adjustment, of course. Southern Appalachian migrants in Cincinnati, like other groups of rural migrants and low-income residents in the city, were also contending with limited employment options, predatory slumlords, and overcrowded and under-resourced public schools—not to mention an openly hostile police force, which by the middle of the 1950s was arresting white Appalachian natives at roughly four times the rate they appeared in the city’s general population. In Detroit, 10 years after pouring into the Arsenal of Democracy in search of wartime defense work, migrants from the rural South made up fully half of the population crammed into the city’s blight-ridden downtown core, an area already riddled with “thousands of dwellings in various stages of decay and deterioration, the majority of which are utterly unfit for human habitation,” according to the city’s charitable agencies. In Uptown—“seedy, dreary, congested, despairing,” as the Chicago Daily Newswould describe it, “Appalachia in Chicago”—more than one in four apartments lacked adequate plumbing, and residential overcrowding was exceeded only in the poor Black neighborhood of Lawndale. By the time the Johnson administration was rolling out the War on Poverty, fewer than half of Uptown’s adult residents were able to secure full-time work. In its focus on “culturally determined patterns of behavior” as opposed to structural factors such as these, the urban-adjustment framing introduced at the Cincinnati workshop consistently mistook the symptoms of the postwar urban crisis for its causes. Instead of recognizing the already accelerating flight of jobs and tax revenues to the suburbs as an early preview of larger-scale disruptions to come, officials used urban adjustment as a rationale for blaming rural poor people for their inability to adapt. In this way, urban adjustment also anticipated the notion of a separate and self-perpetuating “culture of poverty,” first introduced by the anthropologist Oscar Lewis in 1959 and then widely popularized by the journalist and social critic Michael Harrington over the next few years. Lewis developed his influential theory in ethnographic studies of poor families from Mexico and Puerto Rico. But the catalog of pathological behaviors and attitudes that he identified among his subjects—“a strong feeling of marginality, of helplessness, of dependence and inferiority”; “a lack of impulse control, a strong present-time orientation with relatively little ability to defer gratification and plan for the future, a sense of resignation and fatalism”—in many cases directly echoed Giffin’s portrayals of maladjusted Appalachian migrants. Before long, a distorted and punitive version of Lewis’s ideas would win both liberal and conservative adherents and find its way to the very center of postwar social policy, first as a means of explaining why certain groups of people became dependent on social assistance and then as an argument for curtailing or altogether eliminating those very forms of public support. As it did, the urban-adjustment framework’s earlier focus on the cultural habits of the rural poor, broadly defined, gave way to the culture of poverty’s near-singular association with the more and more distressed Black inner city. The consequences of that shift would reverberate to the present. For poor Black communities, the racialized discourse around poverty would be an unmitigated disaster. The slow death of federal poverty-reduction programs begun under Richard Nixon, the massive expansion of a racially targeted war on urban street crime during the 1970s and ’80s, and the culminating assault on welfare “as we know it” during the Clinton years would all be executed under the logic of eradicating a culture of poverty that was said to be the defining hallmark of a new Black underclass. The new preoccupation with race would also further obscure the one redeeming feature of the urban-adjustment framework. In its focus on the common circumstances confronted by populations of the rural dispossessed clustered around the margins of affluent society—Black, white, Hispanic, and otherwise—urban adjustment held out the prospect of a more materially grounded kind of analysis, one that might have seen beyond the cultural or racial explanations for poverty and grasped the larger social and political forces beginning to undermine the postwar economy. The window for turning the language of urban adjustment into a multiracial, bottom-up politics of the poor, though, was always small. By the end of the ’60s, it had been shut for good. As a final consequence of all this, the white poor and working classes would come to occupy a more marginal position in the worldview of Democratic liberalism over subsequent decades. After playing a crucial role in catalyzing liberal attention to the social effects of the postwar urban crisis, the hillbilly ghettos of the urban Midwest largely disappeared from view after the formal launch of the War on Poverty. Meanwhile, as deindustrialization, automation, off-shoring, and new waves of import competition brought ever-widening devastation to the blue-collar workforce of the country’s industrial heartland, professional-class interests elevated by the new knowledge-and-service economy moved to the center of the Democratic Party’s agenda. These “New Democrats” offered the occasional promise to retrain out-of-work miners and factory hands as computer programmers—but in downwardly mobile white working-class communities throughout the region, precious little came of it. Instead, right-wing politicians from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump would find a rich soil in which to plant the seeds of populist resentment, creating one of the more consequential class realignments in modern American political history. Hillary Clinton had these voters in mind, back in 2016, when she wrote off “half of Trump’s supporters” as a “basket of deplorables.” Whatever truth there was in her description of the “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it” nature of Trump’s base—and subsequent events would indicate that there was clearly some truth to it—it was the wrong message for the moment, easily construed as casually elitist and politically tone-deaf. Rightly or wrongly, Clinton seemed more interested in modifying the behavior of these voters than in trying to understand the material foundations of their grievances. When about a quarter of white working-class Obama voters forsook Clinton for Trump in that fall’s election, it was hard not to attribute the results at least in part to Clinton’s failure to convince that portion of the electorate that the party had anything to offer them beyond condescending disregard. If anybody seems to have learned the lessons of Clinton’s faux pas, it is Joe Biden. Since entering the White House, Biden has done more than any Democratic president of the past 75 years to reinvigorate American industrial policy, all while steering its focus toward those parts of the Midwest and South that suffered the effects of deindustrialization most acutely and where the Republican Party has made the most gains among working-class voters. Might this be enough to overcome liberalism’s decades of pathologizing poor and working-class whites? Recent polling suggests that Biden faces an uphill battle among these voters in crucial midwestern swing states. But to paraphrase Roscoe Giffin, a party has to first understand where it’s gone wrong before it will be willing to change its behavior.

In the faintpredawn light, the ship doesn’t look unusual. It is one more silhouette looming pier-side at Naval Base San Diego, a home port of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. And the scene playing out in its forward compartment, as the crew members ready themselves for departure, is as old as the Navy itself. Three sailors in blue coveralls heave on a massive rope. “Avast!” a fourth shouts. A percussivethwackannounces the pull of a tugboat—and 3,000 tons of warship are under way. But now the sun is up, and the differences start to show. Most obvious is the ship’s lower contour. Built in 2014 from 30 million cans’ worth of Alcoa aluminum, Littoral Combat Ship 10, the USS Gabrielle Giffords, rides high in the water on three separate hulls and is powered like a jet ski—that is, by water-breathing jets instead of propellers. This lets it move swiftly in the coastal shallows (or “littorals,” in seagoing parlance), where it’s meant to dominate. Unlike the older ships now gliding past—guided-missile cruisers, destroyers, amphibious transports—the littoral combat ship was built on the concept of “modularity.” There’s a voluminous hollow in the ship’s belly, and its insides can be swapped out in port, allowing it to set sail as a submarine hunter, minesweeper, or surface combatant, depending on the mission. The ship’s most futuristic aspect, though, is its crew. The LCS was the first class of Navy ship that, because of technological change and the high cost of personnel, turned away from specialists in favor of “hybrid sailors” who have the ability to acquire skills rapidly. It was designed to operate with a mere 40 souls on board—one-fifth the number aboard comparably sized “legacy” ships and a far cry from the 350 aboard a World War II destroyer. The small size of the crew means that each sailor must be like the ship itself: a jack of many trades and not, as 240 years of tradition have prescribed, a master of just one. On most Navy ships, only a boatswain’s mate—the oldest of the Navy’s 60-odd occupations—would handle the ropes, which can quickly remove a finger or foot. But none of the three sailors heaving on the Giffords’s ropes is a line-handling professional. One is an information-systems technician. The second is a gunner’s mate. And the third is a chef. “We wear a lot of hats here,” Culinary Specialist 2nd Class Damontrae Butler says. After the ropes are put away, he reports to the ship’s galley, picks up a basting brush, and starts readying a tray of garlic bread for the oven. Two boatswain’s mates are on hand, but only to instruct and oversee—and they too wear lots of hats, between them: fire-team leader, search-and-rescue swimmer, crane operator, deck patroller, helicopter-salvage coordinator. The operative concept is “minimal manning.” On the bridge, five crew members do the jobs usually done by 12, thanks to high-tech display screens and the ship’s several thousand remote sensors. And belowdecks, once-distinct engineering roles—electrician’s mate, engine man, machinist, gas-turbine technician—fall to the same handful of sailors. Minimal manning—and with it, the replacement of specialized workers with problem-solving generalists—isn’t a particularly nautical concept. Indeed, it will sound familiar to anyone in an organization who’s been asked to “do more with less”—which, these days, seems to be just about everyone. Ten years from now, the Deloitte consultant Erica Volini projects, 70 to 90 percent of workers will be in so-called hybrid jobs or superjobs—that is, positions combining tasks once performed by people in two or more traditional roles. Visit Sky West Airlines’ careers site, and you’ll see that the company is looking for “cross utilized agents” capable of ticketing, marshaling and servicing aircraft, and handling luggage. At the online shoe company Zappos, which famously did away with job titles a few years back, employees are encouraged to take on multiple roles by joining “circles” that tackle different responsibilities. If you ask Laszlo Bock, Google’s former culture chief and now the head of the HR start-up Humu, what he looks for in a new hire, he’ll tell you “mental agility.” “What companies are looking for,” says Mary Jo King, the president of the National Résumé Writers’ Association, “is someone who can be all, do all, and pivot on a dime to solve any problem.” The phenomenon is sped by automation, which usurps routine tasks, leaving employees to handle the nonroutine and unanticipated—and the continued advance of which throws the skills employers value into flux. It would be supremely ironic if the advance of the knowledge economy had the effect of devaluing knowledge. But that’s what I heard, recurrently, while reporting this story. “The half-life of skills is getting shorter,” I was told by IBM’s Joanna Daly, who oversaw an apprenticeship program that trained tech employees for new jobs within the company in as few as six months. By 2020,a 2016 World Economic Forum report predicted, “more than one-third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations” will not have been seen as crucial to the job when the report was published. If that’s the case, I asked John Sullivan, a prominent Silicon Valley talent adviser, why should anyone take the time to master anything at all? “You shouldn’t!” he replied. As a rule of thumb, statements out of Silicon Valley should be deflated by half to control for hyperbole. Still, the ramifications of Sullivan’s comment unfurl quickly. Minimal manning—and the evolution of the economy more generally—requires a different kind of worker, with not only different acquired skills but different inherent abilities. It has implications for the nature and utility of a college education, for the path of careers, for inequality and employability—even for the generational divide. And that’s to say nothing of its potential impact on product quality and worker safety, or on the nature of the satisfactions one might derive from work. Or, for that matter, on the relevance of the question What do you want to be when you grow up? How deep these implications go depends, ultimately, on how closely employers embrace the concepts behind minimal manning. The Navy, curiously, has pushed the idea forward with an abandon unseen anywhere on land. Within a few years, 35 littoral combat ships will be afloat, along with three minimally manned destroyers of the new Zumwalt class. The effort seemed to me a good test case for the broader questions bedeviling the economy: Can a few brilliant, quick-thinking generalists really replace a fleet of specialists? Is the value of true expertise in serious decline? I wanted to try to answer these questions—which is why, that morning in San Diego, I joined the crew of the Giffords as it prepared to set sail. A warship is,inthe words ofone Navy analysis, a highly complicated “socio-technical system.” It operates in an environment that is often hostile, even outside of war; its crew—isolated by vast waters—must be ready for every eventuality. Traditionally, navies handled this by staffing their ships amply. Spain’s wood-and-sail Santísima Trinidad carried upwards of 1,000 men at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, providing redundancy in the face of any contingency. If one system failed, there was a backup. This may not have been efficient, but it was effective. The U.S. Navy adopted that model long ago—and has not lost a ship in combat since the Korean War. But the end of the draft, in 1973, brought rising labor costs and, with them, a shift in thinking. “For my entire 39-year career,” the late Admiral Jeremy Boorda said in the early ’90s, “we always talked about buying ships and manning them with people … I think we need to think about things differently now. We need to figure out how to have the fewest number of people possible, and then build [ships] to make them as effective as they need to be.”  In 1995, Boorda converted an aging cruiser, the USS Yorktown, into an experimental “smart ship” on which watches were combined, engine rooms were unmanned, and sailors communicated by handheld radio instead of stationary telephones. The result was promising but modest: a 4 percent reduction in crew size. A series of naval reports concluded that “big dollar savings” could be achieved only with more significant changes, including greater automation and the selection and training of “generalists rather than specialists.” Then, in 2001, Donald Rumsfeld arrived at the Pentagon. The new secretary of defense carried with him a briefcase full of ideas from the corporate world: downsizing, reengineering, “transformational” technologies. Almost immediately, what had been an experimental concept became an article of faith. In what Ronald O’Rourke of the Congressional Research Service has called “an analytical virgin birth,” the Navy committed itself to developing the littoral combat ship and the Zumwalt-class destroyer, using the principles of minimal manning. The LCS came first, partly because it borrowed an Australian design for a passenger ferry and could therefore boost the fleet size quickly. “I think when the Navy started off, they had a really good plan,” Paul Francis, of the Government Accountability Office,told the Senate in 2016. “They were going to build two ships, experimental ships.” But in 2005, having assured itself that “optimal manning works,” the Navy decided to skip the experimentation and move straight to construction. From this point on, whenever the Navy tried to study the feasibility of minimal manning, its analysis was colored by the fact that—on these ships, at least—ithadto work. Dozens of littoral combat ships were on their way. The Giffords was the 10th to deploy. As the skylineof downtown San Diego receded in the distance, we found ourselves approaching a pier that lay along the final extremity of land before the open Pacific. Shimmering far off to the left was Coronado Beach, the legendary training site for Navy SEALs. To the right was the tower of a nuclear submarine. Our mission for the day was to unload ammunition from the ship to an onshore supply base. On deck I spotted a man holding a pair of high-tech binoculars and calling out distances: “Three hundred yards. Two hundred yards.” Turns out it was Butler, who, in addition to his other jobs, was working to become a certified lookout. “You have to be adaptable, very adaptable to the circumstances, or things can really take a turn in a different direction,” he told me, while estimating the distance and bearing of an approaching yacht under the tutelage of another sailor. “For me, that means thinking about the task you’re doing, not the task you’ll have to do.” That is: not dwelling on the garlic bread in the oven. “And asking the right questions. Uh, 500 yards?” He checked his eyeball estimate with the range finder. “Five hundred yards.” What other jobs did he have? Should a fire break out, Butler said, he would become a “boundaryman” and work to stop the spread of smoke to other compartments—a job that, on another ship, would be supervised by a full-time damage-control specialist. The LCS has only two of these—which is one reason it has a “survivability” rating of 1, the lowest score possible. If the ship is critically struck, crew members are expected to simply abandon ship and escape. Traditionalists hate the idea. Butler wasn’t the only character to reappear in different form. During an all-hands meeting—the smallness of the group exaggerated by the large size of the flight deck they stood on—someone pointed to the figure strolling in from stage right. It was one of the two boatswain’s mates who had been overseeing the line-handlers that morning. He had swapped his blue coveralls for head-to-toe green camo, and was walking back and forth, appearing to survey the upper deck of the ship. Such costume changes gave the whole ship the feel of a small theater troupe in which the actor playing the prince’s cousin also plays the apothecary, the friar, and Messenger No. 2. The Navy knew early on that not just anyone could handle this kind of multitasking. By the early 2000s, the Office of Naval Research was commissioning studies on how to select and prepare a crew for the new ships. One of the academics brought in was Zachary Hambrick, a psychology professor at Michigan State University. Instead of trying to understand how well naval candidates might master fixed skills, Hambrick began to examine how they performed in what are known as fluid-task environments. “We wanted to identify characteristics of people who could flexibly shift,” he told me. To that end, in 2010 he administered a test to sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes—and when I traveled to Michigan State to find out more about his work, he invited me to give it a try. In Hambrick’s Expertise Lab, I sat beforea screen divided into quadrants: One showed me a fuel gauge that I had to monitor; another displayed a set of letters I had to memorize; another gave me a set of numbers to add together; and the final one presented me with a red button to push whenever a high-pitched tone sounded. All four tasks contributed equally to my total score, which appeared at the center of the screen. Because there really is no such thing as multitasking—just a rapid switching of attention—I began to feel overstrained, put upon, and finally irked by the impossible set of concurrent demands.Shouldn’t someone be giving me a hand here?This, Hambrick explained, meant I was hitting the limits of working memory—basically, raw processing power—which is an important aspect of “fluid intelligence” and peaks in your early 20s. This is distinct from “crystallized intelligence”—the accumulated facts and know-how on your hard drive—which peaks in your 50s. In a setting where the possession of know-how is trumped by the ability to acquire it quickly, as in Hambrick’s game, fluid intelligence is paramount. (For more on fluid and crystallized intelligence, see “Your Professional Decline Is Coming (Much) Sooner Than You Think,” by Arthur C. Brooks, on page 66.) When the sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes took the test, they were thrown a curveball that I was not: In the middle of the test, the scoring system suddenly changed, so that one quadrant now accounted for 75 percent of the score. Some sailors, Hambrick told me, were quick to spot the change and refocus their attention accordingly. They tended to test high in fluid intelligence. Others noticed the change but continued to devote equal attention to all four tasks. Their scores fell. This group, Hambrick found, was high in “conscientiousness”—a trait that’s normally an overwhelming predictor of positive job performance. We like conscientious people because they can be trusted to show up early, double-check the math, fill the gap in the presentation, and return your car gassed up even though the tank was nowhere near empty to begin with. What struck Hambrick as counterintuitive and interesting was that conscientiousness here seemed to correlate withpoorperformance. Hambrick wasn’t the only one to observe this correlation. While Jeffery Le Pine, an Arizona State management professor and former Air Force officer, was doing Navy-funded research on decision making in the late 1990s, he used a computer game a lot like the one Hambrick administered. The tasks were explicitly military (for instance, assessing the “threat level” of 75 aircraft based on speed, altitude, range, etc.) but the curveball was similar: Unbeknownst to the participants, the scoring rules changed partway through the game. When this happened, he noticed that players who scored high on conscientiousness did worse. Instead of adapting to the new rules, they kept doing what they were doing, only more intently, and this impeded their performance. They were the victims of their own dogged persistence. “I think of it as the person literally going down with a sinking ship,” Le Pine told me. And hediscovered another correlationin his test: The people who did best tended to score high on “openness to new experience”—a personality trait that is normally not a major job-performance predictor and that, in certain contexts, roughly translates to “distractibility.” To borrow the management expert Peter Drucker’s formulation, people with this trait are less focused on doing things right, and more likely to wonder whether they’re doing the right things. High in fluid intelligence, low in experience, not terribly conscientious, open to potential distraction—this is not the classic profile of a winning job candidate. But what if itisthe profile of the winning job candidate of the future? If that’s the case, some important implications would arise. One concerns “grit”—a mind-set, much vaunted these days in educational and professional circles, that allows people to commit tenaciously to doing one thing well. Angela Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania psychology professor, has written powerfully about the value of grit—putting your head down, blocking out distractions, committing over a course of many years to a chosen path. Her writing traces an intellectual lineage that can also be found in Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, which explains extraordinary success as a function of endless, dedicated practice—10,000 hours or more. These ideas are inherently appealing; they suggest that dedication can be more important than raw talent, that the dogged and conscientious will be rewarded in the end. In the stable environments Duckworth and Gladwell draw from (chess, tennis, piano, higher education), a rigid adherence to routine can no doubt serve you well. But in situations with rapidly changing rules and roles, a small but growing body of evidence now suggests that it can leave you ill-equipped. Paul Bartone, a retired Army colonel, seemed to find as much when he studied West Point students and graduates. Traditional measures such as SAT scores and high-school class rank “predicted leader performance in the stable, highly regulated environment of West Point” itself. But once cadets got into actual command environments, which tend to be fluid and full of surprises, a different picture emerged. “Psychological hardiness”—a construct that includes, among other things, a willingness to explore “multiple possible response alternatives,” a tendency to “see all experience as interesting and meaningful,” and a strong sense of self-confidence—was a better predictor of leadership ability in officersafter three years in the field. Thus, Bartone and his co-authors wrote, “traditional predictors [of performance] appear not to hold in the fast-paced and unpredictable operational environment in which military officers are working today.” The world of work is full of such surprises. And as the rules change, so do ideas about what makes a good worker. “Fluid, learning-intensive environments are going to require different traits than classical business environments,” I was told by Frida Polli, a co-founder of an AI-powered hiring platform called Pymetrics. “And they’re going to be things like ability to learn quickly from mistakes, use of trial and error, and comfort with ambiguity.” “We’re starting to see a big shift,” says Guy Halfteck, a people-analytics expert. “Employers are looking less at what you know and more and more at your hidden potential” to learn new things. His advice to employers? Stop hiring people based on their work experience. Because in these environments, expertise can become an obstacle. That was the finding of a 2015 study carried out by the Yale researchers Matthew Fisher and Frank Keil, titled “The Curse of Expertise.” The more we invest in building and embellishing a system of knowledge, they found, the more averse we become to unbuilding it. Jeffery Le Pine has observed this phenomenon in another part of his life. For years, he devoted himself to understanding cars, and amassed a collection of Pontiacs that he maintained himself. But new developments—fuel injection and the like—convinced him that at times he needed expert help. When one of his cars developed a leaky engine, he called in a mechanic whose first attempt to fix the problem was to replace the rear oil seal. The leak persisted, so the mechanic replaced the engine and gave it a new oil seal. Still no luck, so he replaced the whole thing again. Finally, the mechanic read the instructions that came with the oil seal—something a novice would have done at the outset—and learned that newer engines required an extra step. By not doing it, he’d been puncturing the seals and causing new leaks himself. The Yale study nicely summed up the dynamic at play here: All too often experts, like the mechanic in Le Pine’s garage,fail to inspect their knowledge structure for signs of decay. “It just didn’t occur to him,” Le Pine said, “that he was repeating the same mistake over and over.” Yet the limitationsof curious, fluidly intelligent groups of generalists quickly become apparent in the real world. The devaluation of expertise opens up ample room for different sorts of mistakes—and sometimes creates a kind of helplessness. Aboard littoral combat ships, the crew lacks the expertise to carry out some important tasks, and instead has to rely on civilian help. A malfunctioning crane on board one LCS, for example, meant that the crew had to summon an expert to solve the problem, and then had to wait four days for him to arrive. There have been other incidents. Because of a design flaw, the LCS engines started to corrodenot long after the fleet’s launch, but for a long time nobody on board noticed, which led to costly delays and repairs. When a congressional oversight committee found out about the problem in 2011, it called the ships’ crews to task. Who was in charge of checking the engines? The answer was … nobody. The engine rooms were unmanned by design. Meanwhile, the modular “plug and fight” configuration was not panning out as hoped. Converting a ship from sub-hunter to minesweeper or minesweeper to surface combatant, it turned out, was a logistical nightmare. Variants of all three “mission packages” had to be stocked at far-flung ports; an extra detachment of 20-plus sailors had to stand ready to embark with each. More to the point, in order to enable quick mastery by generalists, the technologies on each had to be user-friendly—which they were not. So in 2016 the concept of interchangeability was scuttled for a “one ship, one mission” approach, in which the extra 20-plus sailors became permanent crew members. On it went. The crew of one LCS failed to oil the main engine gear (forcing the ship to limp home from Singapore for a $23 million repair). The crew of another put a seal in the wrong hole, flooding its engine with seawater. “Who was responsible for the training?” the late Senator John Mc Cain asked angrily at a hearing. “Wasn’t someone?” A chastened naval command quietly ordered all LCSs to stand down for several months in 2016, sent their engineering crews back to school for requalification, and bulked up its high-tech courseware, which lets LCS trainees practice tasks on a highly detailed virtual ship. (“I’m going to show you the stern tube-shaft seal assembly,” a virtual officer announces in one training video, by way of greeting.) Onboard routines were updated to include more oversight and double-checking. The ship passed its sea trials, but not with flying colors. “As equipment breaks, [sailors] are required to fix it without any training,” a Defense Department Test and Evaluation employee told Congress. “Those are not my words. Those are the words of the sailors who were doing the best they could to try to accomplish the missions we gave them in testing.” The intentionally small crew size made the ship ill-suited to forward combat, because not enough people were on board to stand watch. These results were, perhaps, predictable given the Navy’s initial, full-throttle approach to minimal manning—and are an object lesson on the dangers of embracing any radical concept without thinking hard enough about the downsides. Even if minimal manning works for a given business or institution, the ramifications for society may not be entirely salubrious. Grit and 10,000 hours of training are appealing in part because they reinforce American self-conceptions that have been present since the country’s founding, ideas about equality of opportunity, about the value of knowledge, about the importance of hard work. And while no one would suggest that effort itself is being devalued today—hard work is just as important in the workplace that’s emerging as in the one that’s receding—a world in which mental agility and raw cognitive speed eclipse hard-won expertise is a world of greater exclusion: of older workers, slower learners, and the less socially adept. “This sounds absurd,” retired Vice Admiral Pete Daly (now head of the U.S. Naval Institute) told me, “but if you keep going down this road, you end up with one really expensive ship with just a few people on it who are geniuses … That’s not a future we want to see, because you need a large enough crew to conduct multiple tasks in combat.” But it’s a future we may need to see. As the cost of computing continues to fall and artificial intelligence usurps more and more human competencies, the collapse of old jobs into new ones seems preferable to their total disappearance. (Look at the unmanned helicopter the Giffords can accommodate, and it’s distressingly easy to picture a sailorless ship. Already, the DOD worries about the vulnerability of an LCS to “swarm boats”—basically, dozens of explosive-laden speedboats, unmanned and computer-coordinated.) And while it seems fair to say that the Navy pushed the LCS forward too hard and too heedlessly, calling its minimal-manning project a failure would be premature. The viability of the aircraft carrier was not obvious to military planners in the 1920s, but then, through an extended process of on-site trial and error, engineers added catapults and arresting wires, and reconfigured flight decks, all of which turned an interesting idea into reality. The LCS is likewise the scene of everyday trial, error, and adjustment. When large vessels stop to dock, for example, they have to be tied up with ropes that are too heavy to throw. So sailors on board throw out smaller ropes that are attached to the big ones, which their colleagues on land can then pull over. On traditional Navy ships, this is done from a ship’s top deck—a sailor tosses the small rope over the side, and the rest is easy. This is how it’s taught at the Navy’s equivalent of boot camp, on a mock wooden ship near Lake Michigan. But on the LCS the ropes reside in the forward compartment, where getting a good side-arm throw out the porthole is next to impossible. One early solution—sending a boatswain’s mate up top to make the toss—proved both awkward and complicated. But this is where having a crew attracted to novel problems is useful. At some point, a sailor had the idea of not throwing but launching the line through the porthole. This unknown soul started fiddling with materials at hand, and lo, the “slingshot” came into being: a rubber bungee cord knotted into an X around four carabiners that clip to the inside of a porthole and, when pulled back and then released, have enough strength to send a bundle of rope to a sailor waiting for it on land. A triumph of found materials, it’s an indication, however small, of what a group of open-minded generalists can achieve: namely, inventing new patterns of working that turn a lack of expertise into an asset. What does all thismean for those of us in the workforce, and those of us planning to enter it? It would be wrong to say that the 10,000-hours-of-deliberate-practice idea doesn’t hold up at all. In some situations, it clearly does. Sports, musicianship, teaching—these are fields where the rules don’t change much over time. In tennis, it pays to put in the hours mastering your serve, because you know you’ll always be serving to a box 21 feet long and 13.5 feet wide, over a net strung 3.5 feet high. In medicine and law, the rules might change—but specialization will probably remain key. A spinal surgery will not be performed by a brilliant dermatologist. A criminal-defense team will not be headed by a tax attorney. And in tech, the demand for specialized skills will continue to reward expertise handsomely. But in many fields, the path to success isn’t so clear. The rules keep changing, which means that highly focused practice has a much lower return. Zachary Hambrick and his co-authors showed as muchin a 2014 meta-analysis. In uncertain environments, Hambrick told me, “specialization is no longer the coin of the realm.” So where does this leave us? It leaves us withlifelong learning, an unavoidably familiar phrase that, before I began this story, sounded tame to me—a motivational reminder that it’s never too late to learn Spanish or enroll in nighttime pottery classes. But when Guillermo Miranda, IBM’s former chief learning officer, used the term in describing to me how employees take advantage of the company’s automated career counselor, Myca, it started to sound like something new. “You can talk to the chatbot,” Miranda said, “and say, ‘Hey, Myca, how do I get a promotion?’ ” Myca isn’t programmed to push any fixed career track. It isn’t dumb enough to try to predict the future—much lessplanfor it. “There is no master plan,” Miranda said. Myca just crunches data, notices correlations, and offers suggestions: Take a course on blockchain. Learn quantum computing. “Look, Jennifer!” it might say. “Three people like you just got promoted because they got these badges.” Even as I reported this story, I found myself the target of career suggestions. “You need to be a video guy, an audio guy!” the Silicon Valley talent adviser John Sullivan told me, alluding to the demise of print media. I found it fascinating and slightly odd that Sullivan would so readily imagine that I would abandon writing—my life’s pursuit since high school—for a new line of work. More than that, though, I found the prospect of starting over just plain exhausting. Building a professional identity takes a lot of resources—money, time, energy. After it’s built, we expect to reap gains from our investment, and—let’s be honest—even do a bit of coasting. Are we equipped to continually return to apprentice mode? Will this burn us out? And will the collective work that results be as good as what came before? Those are questions for the long haul. In 20 years, we’ll know a lot more about the costs and benefits of minimal manning and lifelong learning. But nobody on the Giffords was pondering that after the crew finished its unloading job. They had to get back to base. So 26 crew members crammed into a briefing room, where they talked tides, collision avoidance, and sea lanes, which would be crawling with pleasure craft this time of day. “If action becomes necessary,” said the captain, Shawn Cowan, “take action early.” The ship’s bridge was quiet on the way home. As we sailed, I thought back to an encounter I’d had earlier in the day with two engineer’s mates. I’d found them in a quiet corner of the cargo bay, testing water samples pulled from the ship’s engines for signs of corrosion. We struck up a conversation, and they explained to me that their responsibilities also included maintaining the ship’s gas turbines, diesel engines, water jets, and various pumps—for oil, fuel, drinking water. I told them that sounded like a lot. They agreed, but then one of them added that doing so many things was just the way things go in “this LCS business.” Not only that, he added, but he was learning so much that he might soon earn a promotion that would put him up on the bridge, in charge of the whole propulsion system. Everybody I met on the Giffords seemed to share that mentality. They regarded every minute on board—even during a routine transit back to port in San Diego Harbor—as a chance to learn something new. Which is why, near the end of our trip, as we approached the Coronado Bridge, Captain Cowan gave the helm to a junior officer and asked her to steer us under the bridge and into port. The officer looked intently at the nozzles of the ship’s four water jets, took in the sight of the approaching bridge, and said, “Very well, Captain.” Then she adjusted her course.

104,Atlantic,Trump Isn’t Merely Unhinged David A. Graham,David A. Graham,"With apologies to acertain newspaper’s slogan, many of Donald Trump’s most dangerous statements hide in the plain light of day. The problem is not that they don’t get reported on—they do—but even so, they are easy to tune out, perhaps because he’s been saying outlandish things for so long that people simply can’t bring themselves to parse the new ones; or perhaps because they’ve become accustomed, or at least numb, to his utterances; or perhaps because they don’t want to let him occupy their headspace; or perhaps because he got kicked off Twitter (now X) and they had no interest in joining Truth Social. Or maybe it’s because the more sinister material gets mixed up with his strange elocutions (“We’re gonna have a great country—it’s gonna be called the United States of America”), contrarian hot takes (“You know, Hezbollah is very smart. They’re all very smart”), and gibberish (“All of these indictments that you see—I was never indicted. Practically never heard the word. It wasn’t a word that registered”). Whatever the case may be, Trump has continued to make plainly dangerous and stunning remarks. Notwithstanding his rival Governor Ron De Santis’srecent claimthat Trump has “lost the zip on his fastball,” the former president continues to produce substantive ideas—which is not to say they are wise or prudent, but they are certainly more than gibberish. In fact, much of what Trump is discussing is un-American, not merely in the sense of being antithetical to some imagined national set of mores, but in that his ideas contravene basic principles of the Constitution or other bedrock bases of American government. They are the sorts of ideas that would have been shocking to hear from any mainstream politician just a decade ago. And yet, today, Trump—arguably the single most influential figure in the United States—says these things, and they hardly register. Consider the following examples, all from just the past few months: Trump has beenpromising in speechesto “demolish the deep state.” What he means by that is to end the federal government as it exists today, eliminating the civil-service jobs that have been in place since the late 19th century. This is clear because former Trump aides who are designing the effort, part of a sort of shadow government housed at conservative think tanks,are open about what they have in mind, as my colleague Russell Berman reports: a federal workforce that can be fired by the president at will and must follow his personal whims. That would be a major departure from the current system, where employees are permanent professionals who work for administrations of both parties and are meant to focus on effective implementation, rather than political hacks chosen for their loyalty. While attempting to dodge the 91 criminal indictments against him, Trumpargued in a July 10 courtfiling that he shouldn’t have to deal with the hassle of a federal trial, because running for president “requires a tremendous amount of time and energy.” This goes directly against the idea that no U.S. citizen is above the law. Trump hasn’t just made arguments in court related to thecriminal and civil cases against him; he has also produced a steady stream of invective directed at anyone involved in the cases, to the point of seeking to intimidate witnesses, court staff, and even prosecutors’ family members. Subjects of his threats include the federal judge Tanya Chutkan; New York Justice Arthur Engoron; Engoron’s law clerk (for which Trump was slapped with a gag order); New York Attorney General Letitia James, including his inscrutable andmaybe racistnickname for her; Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff and a possible witness; Special Counsel Jack Smith; and even Smith’s wife, a documentary filmmaker. Smith’s team successfully convinced Chutkan that some of these infractions could threaten the likelihood of a fair trial, and she ordered Trump to stop, though she permitted him to attack her and President Joe Biden, among others, and to call his prosecution political. Trump appealed the order but lost, then promptlyattackedanother potential witness, former Attorney General Bill Barr. (An appeals court has now paused the order once more.) Trump continues to insist, despite presenting no real evidence and losing every relevant court case, that he actually won the 2020 election. “I don’t consider us to have much of a democracy right now,”he said on Meet the Presson September 17. Perversely, Trump now has some incentive to keep lying about the election rather than acknowledge that he lost: Part of Smith’s case is premised on the idea that Trump knew he had been defeated. A functioning democracydepends on the consent of the losers; throughout U.S. history, losers of elections have sometimes grumbled fiercely and other times taken losses gracefully, but none has ever tried to stay in office and then continued to claim he was the rightful winner in the manner Trump has. On Meet the Pressand elsewhere, Trump has continued to excuse the riot on January 6, 2021, and to argue that people charged in the riots are political prisoners. He told the Meet the Pressmoderator, Kristen Welker, that he might pardon people convicted of federal crimes for their involvement in the assault on the seat of U.S. government: “Well, I’m going to look at them, and I certainly might if I think it’s appropriate. No, it’s a very, very sad thing. And it’s—they’re dividing the country so badly, and it’s very dangerous.” He has since referred to these people as “hostages,” a description that makes sense only if you find the very idea of policing the insurrection illegitimate. Trump also continues to flirt with the idea of granting himself a pardon, typically saying he doesn’t see any need for it butrefusing to rule it out. Most mainstream scholars say a self-pardon is probably not constitutional and certainly not something the framers intended. During Rosh Hashanah, on September 17, Trumpshared a memethat read, “Just a reminder for liberal Jews who voted to destroy America & Israel because you believed false narratives! Let’s hope you learned from your mistake & make better choices going forward!” As my colleague Yair Rosenberg wrote, Trump has often made such offensive remarks about the loyalties—perceived or desired—of American Jews, but this was “particularly ugly in the way it deliberately singled out a specific constituency during that constituency’s holiest season.” Apparently outraged by the Atlanticeditor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg’s profileof General Mark Milley, whom Trump appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Trump on September 22 accused Milley of treason andsuggested that he deserved the death penalty. “This guy turned out to be a Woke train wreck who, if the Fake News reporting is correct, was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States. This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!”Trump wrote. Trump’sloose and sloppy treason accusationshave alwaysundermined the Constitution, and many past comments like this have precipitated threats and evenattacksfrom Trump supporters. Trump has never had any interest in upholding the First Amendment, buthis remarks on September 24 were unusually sharp. Trump wrote that NBC News, and especially MSNBC, “should be investigated for its ‘Country Threatening Treason.’ Why should NBC, or any other of the corrupt & dishonest media companies, be entitled to use the very valuable Airwaves of the USA, FREE? They are a true threat to Democracy and are, in fact, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” This sort of demonization of the press is dangerous per se—as demonstrated by attacks on journalists—as are Trump’s casual accusations of treason, but this one carries a clear threat to try to use the power of the federal government to punish a news organization for reporting he doesn’t like. This contradicts even the most limited, basic understanding of the importance of a free press, as protected by the First Amendment. (Set aside the dissonance of saying this shortly after granting an in-depth interview to NBC News!) During a September 28 interview, Trump said he would imprison his political adversaries if he is reelected. Glenn Beckasked Trump, “You said in 2016, you know, ‘Lock her up.’ And then when you became president, you said, ‘We don’t do that in America.’ That’s just not the right thing to do. That’s what they’re doing. Do you regret not locking her up? And if you’re president again, will you lock people up?” Trump replied, “Uh, the answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.” Because Trump believes, or claims to believe, that he is being prosecuted for purely political reasons, he’s vowing to go after his political opponents for the crime of being his political opponents—a violation of both free-speech and due-process protections. At a rally two days later, on September 30, Trump once againadvocatedgoing around the criminal-justice system to administer vigilante punishment. “Very simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store,” he told the California Republican Party, adding: “Shot!” (The Associated Press, either too nonchalantly or with dry understatement,described it this way: “Trump animates California Republicans with calls to shoot people who rob stores.”) This, too, violates the basic concept of due process for accused criminals. Among Trump’s many fulminations against Justice Engoron, Trump told reporters on October 2 not only that the judge should be removed from the bench, but that he should face prosecution—for no apparent crime other than being assigned to Trump’s case and ruling against Trump. “This is a judge that should be disbarred,”he said. “This is a judge that should be out of office. This is a judge that some people say could be charged criminally for what he’s doing. He’s interfering with an election.” During an October 23 rally in New Hampshire,Trump told attendees, “You don’t have to vote, don’t worry about voting. The voting, we got plenty of votes, you gotta watch.” As is sometimes the case with Trump, it’s hard to tell whether this is intended as a joke; or a statement that if all votes were counted, he would win; or as some sort of intimation of stealing the election himself. In any case, discouraging civic participation contradicts the basic principle of a government by, for, and of the people. At the same rally, Trump talked about his love for one of the most repressive leaders in Europe: “There’s a man, Viktor Orbán, did anyone ever hear of him? He’s probably, like, one of the strongest leaders anywhere in the world. He’s the leader of Turkey,” Trump said, adding that he had a “front” on Russia. In fact, Orbán is the leader of Hungary (Trump later corrected himself), and neither country shares a border with Russia. More to the point, Orbán—who proudly describes himself as “illiberal”—is an authoritarian who has become a darling of the Trumpist right, as my colleague Anne Applebaum has explained. The biggest headlines out of Trump’s October 29 rally in Sioux City, Iowa, came from his confusing the city with Sioux Falls, South Dakota—the sort of slipup that undermines his attacks on Biden as senile. But the more substantively disturbing thing Trump said at the rally was that his own indictments would give him permission to politically prosecute his predecessor. “They brought our country to a new level, and, but that allows—think of this—that allows us to do it to Biden, when he gets out,”Trump said. “And that would be very easy.” In a Univision interview that aired November 9, headded: “They have done something that allows the next party—I mean, if somebody, if I happen to be president and I see somebody who’s doing well and beating me very badly, I say ‘Go down and indict them.’ They’d be out of business, they’d be out of the election.” This goes beyond Trump’s suggestion of going after his opponents in a general way. Few things could be more directly counter to the idea of a democratic republic, and more redolent of a failed state, than a pretextual prosecution of one’s predecessor.",2023-11-13T12:30:00Z,13.0,11.0,2023.0
105,Atlantic,The Plight of the Eldest Daughter Sarah Sloat,Sarah Sloat,"This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday.Sign up for it here. Being an eldest daughter means frequently feeling like you’re not doing enough, like you’re struggling to maintain a veneer of control, like the entire household relies on your diligence. At least, that’s what a contingent of oldest sisters has been saying online. Across social-media platforms, they’ve described the stress offeeling accountablefor theirfamily’s happiness,the pressureto succeed, and the impression that theyaren’t being cared forin the waythey care for others. Some are still teens;othershave grown up and left home but still feel over-involved and overextended. As oneviral tweetput it, “are u happy or are u the oldest sibling and also a girl”? People have even coined a term for this: “eldest-daughter syndrome.” That “syndrome” does speak to a real social phenomenon, Yang Hu, a professor of global sociology at Lancaster University, in England, told me. In many cultures, oldest siblings as well as daughters of all ages tend to face high expectations from family members—so people playing both parts are especially likely to take on a large share of household responsibilities, and might deal with more stress as a result. But that caregiving tendency isn’t an inevitable quality of eldest daughters; rather, researchers told me, it tends to be imposed by family members who are part of a society that presumes eldest daughters should act a certain way. And the online outpour of grievances reveals how frustratingly inflexible assumptions about family roles can be. Research suggests some striking differences in the experiences of first- and secondborns. Susan Mc Hale, a family-studies professor emeritus at Penn State University, told me that parents tend to be “focused on getting it right with the first one,” leading them to fixate on their firstborn’s development growing up—their grades, their health, the friends they choose. With their subsequent children, they might be less anxious and feel less need to micromanage, and that can lead to less tension in the parent-child dynamic. On average, American parentsexperience less conflictwith their secondborn than with their first. Mc Hale has found that when firstborns leave home, their relationship with their familytends to improve—and conflict then commonly increases between parents and their younger children, because the spotlight is on them. Birth order can also create a hierarchy: Older siblings are oftenasked to serveas babysitters,role models, and advice-givers for their younger siblings. To be clear, birth orderdoesn’t influencepersonality itself—but itcaninfluence how your family sees you, Brent Roberts, a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told me. Eldest kids, for example, aren’t necessarily more responsible than their siblings; instead, they tend to be given more responsibilities because they are older. That role can affect how you understand yourself. Corinna Tucker, a professor emerita at the University of New Hampshire who studies sibling relationships, told me that parents frequently compare their children—“‘This is my athlete’; ‘this is my bookworm’; … ‘so-and-so is going to take care of me when I’m old’”—and kids internalize those statements. But your assigned part might not align with your disposition, Roberts said. People can grow frustrated with the traits expected of them—or of their siblings. When Roberts asks his students what qualities they associate with firstborns, students who are themselves firstborns tend to list off positives like “responsible” and “leadership”; those who aren’t firstborns, he told me, call out “bossy” and “overcontrolling.” Gender introduces its own influence on family dynamics. Women are usually the “kin keepers,” meaning they perform the often invisible labor of “making sure everybody is happy, conflicts are resolved, and everybody feels paid attention to,” Mc Hale told me. On top of that emotional aid, herresearchshows, young daughters spend more time, on average, than sons doing chores; the jobs commonly given to boys, such as shoveling snow and mowing the lawn, are irregular and not as urgent. Daughteringis the term that Allison Alford, a Baylor University communication professor whoresearchesadult daughters, uses to describe the family work that girls and women tend to take on. That can look like picking up prescriptions, planning a retirement party, or setting aside money for a parent’s future; it can also involve subtler actions, like holding one’s tongue to avoid an argument or listening to a parent's worries. Daughtering can be satisfying, even joyful. But it can also mean caring for siblings and sometimes for parents in a way that goes above and beyond what children, especially young ones, should need to do, Alford told me. Research on eldest daughters specifically is limited, but experts told me that considering the pressures foisted on older siblingsandon girls and women, occupying both roles isn’t likely to be easy. Tucker put it this way: Women are expected to be nurturers. Firstborns are expected to be exemplars. Trying to be everything for everyone is likely to lead to guilt when some obligations are inevitably unfulfilled. Of course, these conclusions don’t apply to all families. But so it is with eldest daughters: Although not all of them are naturally conscientious or eager to kin-keep, our cultural understanding of family roles ends up shaping the expectations many feel the need to rise to. The people describing “eldest-daughter syndrome” are probably all deeply different, but talking about what they share might make their burdens feel a little lighter. And the best-case scenario, Alford told me, is that families can start renegotiating what daughtering looks like—which should also take into account what eldest daughters want for themselves.",2023-11-14T12:00:00Z,14.0,11.0,2023.0
106,CNN,Israel-Hamas war,MJ Lee,"A recent draft of a possible deal to secure the release of hostages that Hamas is holding in Gaza proposes a four- to five-day pause in fighting for the initial release of 50 hostages, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. An agreement has yet to be struck and the text of a deal has been traded back and forth for weeks. But negotiators from various countries, including senior Biden administration officials, are expressing rare optimism about the progress. Gaps in some of the major sticking points have begun to close, sources say, and while the talks could still break down, an agreement may now be days away. “We think that we are closer than we have been perhaps at any point since these negotiations began weeks ago,”deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN’s Jake Tapperon “State of the Union” on Sunday. Finer did not get into details of the talks and stressed that there is no final deal in place. In a sign of how tenuous the talks have been, two sources told CNN that in recent days, Hamas had put the negotiations on hold at least once. One of the many issues that the terrorist group raised, and that appeared to have prompted Hamas abruptly going dark amid the talks, was Israel’s raid of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. But the discussions eventually picked back up. One key issue yet to be finalized is how to implement the deal, including around aid shipments to Gaza, one source familiar with the negotiations said Sunday on the heels of a meeting between Qatar’s prime minister and Brett Mc Gurk, the White House coordinator for Middle East affairs. Qatar has served as a main interlocutor in the talks. The most recent discussions have proposed the staggered release of civilian hostages, with pauses potentially increasing after Hamas allows for an initial release of a significant number of those captured, according to the sources. Israel has presented a list of approximately 100 civilian hostages it wants included in the agreement, one source told CNN. Israel has publicly demanded that all hostages be released. Hamas indicated it would be willing to release 50 hostages over a multiday pause. More hostages, around 20 to 25, could be released after that as the pauses are extended. Hamas has said it needs pauses in fighting to gather the hostages who are being held in different places and by different Hamas-allied groups in Gaza. The National Security Council and the Israeli embassy to the US declined to comment for this story. The Qatari Embassy to the US didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment. There are still details to be worked out over aid, with Israel expressing concern that aid could go to help Hamas rather than civilians. Hamas initially requested 500 trucks of aid per day, one of the sources said. One source said no agreement has been reached on how many aid trucks could enter Gaza but that more than 200 trucks was logistically challenging. There are also questions about how to inspect the trucks and which points of entry would be used. The aid, including fuel and cooking oil for bakeries, would continue to flow in after the initial pauses for hostages.

107,CNN,Rosalynn Carter,Unknown,"Rosalynn Carter, who as first lady worked tirelessly on behalf of mental health reform and professionalized the role of the president’s spouse, died Sunday at the age of 96, according to The Carter Center. Rosalynn Carterpassed away peacefully with family by her side at her home in Plains, Georgia, the center said in a statement. “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” her husband, former President Jimmy Carter, said. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.” The Carter Centerannounced Friday that the former first lady had entered hospice care. She was diagnosed with dementia in May. Her husbandbegan home hospice carein February, following a series of hospital stays. Jimmy Carter was defeated in a landslide by Ronald Reagan four years after being elected. His single term in the White House included forging a rare peace agreement between Israel and Egypt that continues to this day, but it was also marked by soaring inflation and the Iran hostage crisis. Through it all, Rosalynn was by his side, and often whispering in his ear. The Carters redefined and revolutionized the post-presidency and, through their joint efforts, they worked on world peace and human rights on behalf of The Carter Center, a nongovernmental Atlanta-based organization founded to “wage peace, fight disease and build hope.” First lady Jill Biden celebrated Rosalynn Carter’s life on Sunday, telling service members and their families at a Naval Station Norfolk holiday event, “The former first lady Rosalynn Carter has just passed. And she was well known for her efforts on mental health and caregiving and women’s rights.” “And so I hope that during the holidays you’ll … include the Carter family in your prayers,” Jill Biden said. President Joe Biden praised the Carter family while speaking to reporters after the holiday event. “They’re really an incredible family because they brought so much grace to the office,” he said. Former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush similarly praised Rosalynn Carter as “a woman of dignity and strength.” “There was no greater advocate of President Carter, and their partnership set a wonderful example of loyalty and fidelity. She leaves behind an important legacy in her work to destigmatize mental health. We join our fellow citizens in sending our condolences to President Carter and their family,” the pair said in a joint statement. After leaving the White House, the couple traveled to hot spots around the world, including visits to Cuba, Sudan and North Korea, monitoring elections and working to eradicate Guinea worm disease and other neglected tropical diseases. Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. “The Carter Center is a shared legacy. She’s been there digging latrines right next to him,” said the Carters’ friend Jill Stuckey, a leader at Maranatha Baptist Church, where both Carters attended and where Jimmy Cartertaught Sunday school. Rosalynn Carter’s most lasting individual legacy will be her efforts to diminish the stigma attached to people with mental illnesses and her fight for parity and access for mental health treatment. She also devoted her time to the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving at her alma mater, Georgia Southwestern State University, to help families and professional caregivers living with disabilities and illnesses. In 1999, then-President Bill Clinton presented both Carters with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country’s highest civilian honor. He said they had “done more good things for more people in more places than any other couple on Earth.” Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter shared what many would call a true American story and a genuine lifelong partnership. In 2015, when the 39th president announced his brain cancer diagnosis, he was asked of which accomplishment he was proudest. He did not hesitate to say that it was marrying Rosalynn: “That’s the pinnacle of my life.” He shared at another point the secret of his enduring marriage. “Rosalynn has been the foundation for my entire enjoyment of life. … First of all, it’s best to choose the right woman, which I did. And secondly, we give each other space to do our own things,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “The Lead” in July 2015. It was likely that Eleanor Rosalynn Smith would cross paths with Jimmy Carter in their small hometown of Plains, Georgia. They grew up at a time when candy cost a nickel and everyone in town knew one another. “Occasionally someone would open a restaurant, but it would never last very long,” Rosalynn wrote in her memoir, “First Lady from Plains.” Rosalynn did not grow up with much money. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father was an automobile mechanic who died from cancer when she was 13. She helped raise her younger siblings and considered her father’s death the end of her childhood. The Carters met through Jimmy’s sister, Ruth, who was Rosalynn’s closest friend. When Rosalynn saw a photo of Carter on Ruth’s bedroom wall she thought, “He was the most handsome man I’d ever seen.” She even asked Ruth if she could take his photograph home with her. Both devout Southern Baptists, Jimmy and Rosalynn met after a church meeting and soon began dating. They were married not long after his graduation from the Naval Academy when she was 18 and he was 21. “When we got married, I think I was kin to everybody that Jimmy wasn’t,” Rosalynn wrote in her memoir. “Once we got married, we were kin to everybody in town.” As the wife of a naval officer, Rosalynn moved frequently and she managed a large household. The Carters had three children in quick succession: John William (“Jack”), the year after their wedding in Norfolk; James Earl (“Chip”) III, less than three years later in Hawaii; and Donnel Jeffrey (“Jeff”) in New London, Connecticut, in 1952. Their only daughter, Amy Lynn, was born in 1967, a year after Carter lost his first bid for Georgia governor. Jimmy Carter had been accepted to an elite nuclear submarine program but resigned his commission in Schenectady, New York, after his father died so that they could return to Plains in 1953 to look after the family farm. He decided to relocate the family without asking Rosalynn’s opinion. Rosalynn was so furious that she refused to talk to him the entire drive south. After that, Jimmy Carter said he consulted with his wife on all major decisions. Later nicknamed the “Steel Magnolia” by the press – a reference she did not mind, saying once in an interview with C-SPAN that “steel is tough and magnolia is southern” –  Rosalynn was naturally shy and her knees would knock together when she had to give a speech in the early days of her husband’s political career in the 1960s. But by the time he announced his presidential campaign in December 1974, she was a seasoned politician herself. Describing her transformation from housewife to political partner, Carter aide Stuart Eizenstat said, “This shy woman blossomed in the most wonderful way.” It was not long before she would number the president’s jokes so that he would not repeat any of them to the same group. She even started taking memory classes to remember faces and names and typed thank you letters to people her husband had met on the campaign trail. She stayed up until the early hours of the morning to work on her speeches. Former President Donald Trump made specific note of the Carters’ long marriage in a statement Sunday praising her years of service to the country. “Melania and I join all Americans in mourning the loss of Rosalynn Carter. She was a devoted First Lady, a great humanitarian, a champion for mental health, and a beloved wife to her husband for 77 years, President Carter,” Trump posted on social media. Carter ran for president as a Washington outsider seeking to distance himself from the paranoia and cynicism of former President Richard Nixon. He had a group of Georgia volunteers, known as the “Peanut Brigade,” campaign for him. Rosalynn hit the road with a vengeance, and when she arrived in a small town, she scoped out the tallest antennae and headed there – the local television and radio stations – to offer herself up for an interview. In her memoir, she wrote that some of the smaller stations with few employees had no idea who Jimmy Carter was. Rosalynn came prepared, carrying a list of five or six questions she wanted asked. Nine times out of 10, she said, the station used the questions she suggested. “I was getting my message across,” she said in her memoir. For 18 months during the presidential campaign, she went to 105 communities in Iowa and spent 75 days in Florida in support of her husband. “My nervousness began to disappear when I realized people seemed pleased to meet me, though I still had trouble with a dry throat and sometimes a trembling voice when I approached an interview or a speech,” she wrote in her memoir. Carter won a narrow victory, capturing just 51% of the popular vote and 297 electoral votes to defeat President Gerald Ford, who had assumed the presidency upon Nixon’s resignation in 1974. The Carters ignored security concerns and broke with tradition when they decided to walk hand-in-hand with their daughter Amy down Pennsylvania Avenue after the inauguration ceremony. It was part of their mutual desire to connect with people and move away from what they saw as Nixon’s imperial presidency. Rosalynn even wore the same gold-embroidered sleeveless coat over a blue chiffon dress that she wore to her husband’s inauguration as governor in 1971 to the galas for his 1977 inauguration as president. It was designed by Mary Matise for Jimmae and she bought it from a store in Americus, Georgia. As a young girl, she had admired then-first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, an influential global leader who took on issues such as civil rights and poverty. Once in the White House, Rosalynn helped to transform the office of first lady and became the first to hire a chief of staff whose government salary and rank were equal to the president’s chief of staff. She was the first first lady to work out of the East Wing. Before her, first ladies worked from an office on the second or third floors of the White House in the family’s private residence. And under her watch, full-time positions in the East Wing grew by almost 20%. But her ambitious approach to the role drew criticism, particularly her controversial decision to sit in on her husband’s Cabinet meetings. As first lady she fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to outlaw civil rights discrimination based on sex. Steven Hochman, who has worked with the Carters since 1981 and is director of research at The Carter Center, said Rosalynn did not hesitate to disagree with her husband in public as the years went on. During speeches, the former president liked to tell audience members that one of his elementary school teachers used to tell her students that “any child could be president.” “Mrs. Carter would correct him,” Hochman recalled in an interview. “She’d say, ‘No, she never said that. She said, anyboycould be president.’” In her memoir, Rosalynn recalled eating lunch with her husband in the Oval Office every Wednesday, similar to the vice president’s weekly lunch with the president. The ritual came about because Rosalynn had pressing topics to discuss, including their personal finances, their children and the issues she deeply cared about, including mental health. Before those weekly lunches, when the president stepped off the elevator on the second floor at the end of the day, she would approach him with an onslaught of questions and suggestions. She talked to mothers about how high fuel prices were affecting their family budgets and she met with children in struggling schools, and she wanted to bring these issues to his attention. Once he suggested a weekly lunch, she began to organize such conversations, putting important notes in a brown leather folder. The folder sat on her desk in her bedroom and she stuck notes in it throughout the week. By the time she brought it with her to their Wednesday lunch, it was packed. In a statement Sunday, former first lady Michelle Obama highlighted how Rosalynn Carter understood that the role of first lady is “largely shaped by the passions and aspirations of the person holding it” and said “she reminded me to make the role of First Lady my own, just like she did.” “Today, Barack and I join the world in celebrating the remarkable legacy of a First Lady, philanthropist, and advocate who dedicated her life to lifting up others,” Michelle Obama added. Rosalynn Carter’s signature issue was mental health. When she was campaigning for her husband during his 1970 race for governor, she was overwhelmed by the number of people who asked her what she would do for a relative dealing with mental illness. “One day, when Jimmy was speaking at a rally, I got in line with everybody else to shake hands with him,” she recalled decades laterin an interview with The Carter Center. “He saw who I was, grinned, and asked, ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘I came to see what you are going to do about mental health when you are governor,’ I replied.” She had a distant cousin with mental illness and she remembered running and hiding when she would hear him coming down the streets of their small town singing loudly. “He probably wanted nothing more than friendship and recognition, yet he was different, and when I heard him, my impulse was to flee,” the former first lady wrote in her memoir. The experience left such a deep impression on her that she devoted much of her time in the White House to advocating for better care for people with mental illnesses. As Georgia’s first lady, she helped shift treatment to community mental health centers, and in the White House, she helped her husband create a Presidential Commission on Mental Health. The day the commission was announced, Rosalynn Carter told the press that she had just gotten a note informing her that the Department of Justice prohibited the president from appointing a close relative, such as a wife, to a civilian position. Up until then, she had been planning to chair the committee. “There is, however, no problem with you being designated as honorary chairperson,” she said, amid laughter from reporters. “So I’m going to be a very active honorary chairperson.” In 1979, she became the second first lady to testify before Congress (Eleanor Roosevelt was the first) when she spoke about the need for mental health reform. “Throughout her long, remarkable life, she was an unwavering voice for the overlooked and underrepresented,” former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Sunday. “Thanks to her mental health advocacy, more people live with better care and less stigma.” As first lady, she tried to be in the family’s private quarters to greet 9-year-old daughter Amy by 4 p.m. on school days, and at 6:30 p.m. they had dinner together most nights. Amy was the first presidential child to attend a public school since Theodore Roosevelt’s son. In the White House, Rosalynn would urge her husband to put off controversial decisions until after his reelection. She freely admitted, “I am much more political than Jimmy and was more concerned about popularity and winning reelection.” She lobbied to have her husband fire Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joe Califano. According to longtime Carter family friend and White House aide Jerry Rafshoon, she was angry at Califano over an anti-smoking campaign, fearing that it would hurt Carter’s standing in tobacco-producing North Carolina. “I wanted Jimmy to fire Joe Califano long before he ever did,” she wrote in her memoir, “and my reasons were purely political.” She opposed Carter’s Rose Garden strategy not to campaign against his 1980 Democratic primary challenger, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, and instead to stay holed up in the White House negotiating the release of American hostages in Iran. She also did not agree with Carter’s decision to bar alcohol from White House social events, though they did ultimately serve wine and spiked punch. The impression of out-of-touch Southern Baptists in the White House created a “stereotype that we never lived down,” she said. She was sent to Central and South America to deliver a serious message on human rights. At first, leaders and the press were skeptical about a first lady taking such an important political trip, but eventually they realized that she had a direct line to the president. She brought home tangible achievements: Ecuador pledged to sign and ratify the American Convention on Human Rights; the military leader of Peru vowed to give up power (four years later Rosalynn attended the inauguration of the democratically elected president of Peru); and the president of Colombia pressed to move negotiations forward on the Panama Canal. Rafshoon recalled that it was Rosalynn’s idea to hold the Middle East peace talks at Camp David, which became her husband’s greatest achievement as president. She wanted the negotiation to happen there because of Camp David’s tranquil and isolated location in the Maryland mountains. At the 13-day Camp David summit, Rosalynn took almost 200 typed pages of notes. But any accomplishments of the Carter presidency were ultimately overshadowed by a 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, in which revolutionary students stormed the US Embassy in Tehran and took more than 60 Americans hostage. The brunt of campaigning in 1980 fell to Rosalynn as Jimmy Carter decided to stay in the White House to handle the crisis. She checked in several times a day from the campaign trail, and when she could not speak with her husband, she talked with Carter’s national security adviser, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who discussed how to handle the crisis. “I kept her abreast because I knew she would be discussing those issues with the president,” Brzezinski said in an interview. Her biggest regret in life was her husband losing reelection in 1980. “I’d like people to know that we were right, that what Jimmy Carter was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him,” she said in her memoir. Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter had four children, 12 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. When the Carters left the White House in 1981, they returned to Plains and embarked on the longest and most ambitious post-presidency in American history. With the exception of Harry and Bess Truman, the Carters are the only post-World War II president and first lady to return to their hometown and, since their return, Rosalynn worked to revitalize the working-class community, revamping the local inn and adding a butterfly garden. She and her husband were active members of the Maranatha Baptist Church, where she served as a deacon. But they are perhaps most famous for their humanitarian work with The Carter Center, to which they devoted 51 weeks a year (the remaining week they spent working for Habitat for Humanity). “The global staff of The Carter Center grieves the passing of our visionary co-founder, former U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose compassion, strength, and leadership inspired us all,” the Atlanta-based organization said in a statement Sunday. “For more than 50 years, Mrs. Carter was a tireless advocate for those living with mental illnesses, supporting practical measures and policy reforms to create parity for mental illnesses with physical illnesses in Georgia, the United States, and the rest of the world.” In a 2016 interview, Rosalynn reflected on the nearly four decades that had passed since leaving Washington. “I missed having Jimmy in the Oval Office taking care of our country,” she said. “I have never felt as safe as I did when he was there. I still have a bully pulpit to work on issues I like, and because he was president, I have unlimited opportunities. It is a good life.” This is a breaking story and will be updated.

108,CNN,Russia’s war in Ukraine,Unknown,"On the global stage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been consistently on message: In visits to Washington and other Western capitals, he has focused onkeeping Kyiv suppliedwith more advanced arms, ammunition and financing. At home, however, he faces a human resources problem. The war is approaching the end of its second year, and Ukraine’s military needs more manpower to sustain a bloody war of attrition against Russia, a country with more than three times the population of Ukraine. In arecent essay, Ukraine’s top military commander,Valery Zaluzhny acknowledged that training and recruiting troops was becoming a serious challenge. “The prolonged nature of the war, limited opportunities for the rotation of soldiers on the line of contact, gaps in legislation that seem to legally evade mobilization, significantly reduce the motivation of citizens to serve with the military,” he said. The essay acknowledged a bleak reality: Ukraine needs more people in uniform, and it needs them now. So, how serious is Ukraine’s mobilization challenge? The issue is clouded, in part, by official secrecy. Kyiv does not publicly disclose its manpower targets; nor does it reveal the total number of dead and wounded, although casualties on both sides since February 2022 are estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands. Ukraine fills its ranks with volunteers but also has a system of conscription that allows the state to draft men of military age. After Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine imposed martial law, under which all males between the ages of 18 and 60 were considered liable for military service and could be mobilized unless they were eligible for a deferment. In 2023, the rules of military registration were updated to include women. But the measures stopped short of full conscription. Martial law introduced draconian travel restrictions. Men between 18 and 60 are generally barred from exiting the country, although there are a wide range of exemptions, covering everything from single parents of young children to professional athletes. While it is difficult to get an exact portrait of how far Ukrainians are responding to the call to serve in the military, officials have acknowledged publicly that evading military service and enforcing mobilization rules are an issue. At a briefing on November 9, State Border Service of Ukraine spokesperson Andriy Demchenko said that over the last 10 months, 43,000 citizens of Ukraine were refused exit at the border. “The reasons were different, but mostly because they did not qualify,” he said. The war is sometimes simplified as an industrial contest: Ukraine’s Western backers are racing to produce ammunition for Kyiv, as Moscow ramps up domestic production of artillery shells andseeks fresh supplies from North Korea. But it’s also a recruitment contest against Russia. Mobilization is a matter of survival for Ukraine. A long-awaited counteroffensive across a broad front has failed to yield any major breakthroughs on the battlefield, and Western support is at risk of wavering,especially as events in Israel and Gaza in the last month divert attention from the prolonged conflict in Europe. CNN spoke with several individuals of fighting age to get snapshots of their motivations to fight – or to avoid enlistment. Interviews are condensed and edited for length and clarity. Some of those interviewed did not want to give their full names. Maj. Viktor Kysil serves with the “Khartiia” brigade. Until recently, he was involved in recruiting for his unit. All those who wanted to serve voluntarily have already served somewhere. There are still people who do not want to serve of their own free will. If a person hasn’t come under the attention of the military enlistment office by 16-18 months into the war, then he or she obviously hopes that he or she won’t be drafted into the army for the next 18 months. From what I can see, there is a shortage of military personnel, sometimes a critical shortage. Besides, a variety of military positions require different skills - some require physical training, some require intellectual skills. Everybody has different skills. As a military man, I was served with a (draft) summons in the street several times. I have encountered people who were recruited online. When a person learns that he or she has a chance to go to the war zone, the desire to earn (a monthly army salary of) UAH 20-30,000 ($550-$830 per month) or even UAH 100,000 ($2,750) immediately disappears. If the war continues with the same intensity as it is today, there is no way to avoid conscription. Mark Holovei, 29, works as a civilian volunteer supporting the military. He is willing to be mobilized. In general, I cannot be drafted due to my health problems. I have chronic polycystic kidney disease. It is not treatable. I’m on a special diet and have to be admitted to the hospital every six months as a preventive measure. I also have type 2 diabetes. I have to take medication all the time. But I think that now if someone gets a draft notice, then no one will consider the health problems, for the purpose of filling the ranks. Anyway, I’m not afraid of it. If I get a draft notice, I am ok with being mobilized. It’s just that now I actually know where I want to be mobilized. I want to join the brigade of my boys, who I’ve been volunteering for. In the very beginning of the full-scale invasion a friend of mine asked to help and bring something to the military. At first, I was mainly bringing food, drinks, some cookies, cigarettes, etc. And I mainly helped my friends and friends of friends. Later I started helping with the medicine - I was gathering the first aid kits and the tourniquets. At first I was coming to the units 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) away from the front line, then I was getting closer and closer to the front line. Civilians have become too relaxed. The dance clubs are working, night taxis are working. Until there’s a missile attack on their city, people tend to forget that we’re actually in the middle of the war. Maria Zaika, 31, is the marketing manager of a pharmacy network. She is ready to register for service. “I went to my local military enlistment office to find out more (about mobilization). I wanted to register. I asked the recruitment officer whether it was voluntary for women, to which he replied it was ‘voluntary-compulsory.’ “I am ready to register for service, I am not afraid. Now women are starting to be recruited. In general, a lot of female pharmacists voluntarily join the army. “I’ve talked with my husband about me registering in the military enlistment office. He supported me. “In general, military men are not being very supportive of their girlfriends or wives joining the army, as the level of sexism is still pretty high in the army. “In general, I’m sure we have problems with reserves. My (military) husband tells me about the situation on the front line and I understand that we’re running out of people. A lot of Russians (are) getting killed, yes, but their numbers don’t seem to run out.” Yevhen, 32, is an IT specialist. He plans to challenge any draft summons. “I think that everything that happens with mobilization is illegal and unfair. Legally, there are no grounds for many actions in the recruitment centers. Therefore, I have a negative attitude to everything that is happening. Of course, it is not about supporting Russia, it is clear that they attacked us. But… if I get a draft notice tomorrow, I will consult a lawyer and challenge it. “Everyone talks about responsibilities. But I have a question: What has this country given me that I owe it anything? My parents paid for my education, although I was an excellent student and had to study on a budget. It turns out that no one adheres to the law, but everyone talks about obligations. “What good am I at the front if I have no military training? I will either be killed in two minutes, or I will work here and pay taxes and support the economy.” Oleksandr Dyadyushkin, 36, an HR consultant before the full-scale war and a lecturer in philosophy and the history of religion, volunteered for this year’s counteroffensive last month. “I understood that (this) would be a rather protracted conflict, with guys coming to the front, gaining experience, but the enemy would work in the same way. That is why the number of professional troops participating in the fighting will be constantly growing, both on our side and on the enemy’s side. “We need to focus on the long game. Not in the sense that I am ready to lay down my life, but in the sense that I will improve my skills from month to month, year to year. That’s why I don’t regret coming here now. I see a job for me. “The role of people in this war is crucial. As you know, it is not steel that wins, it is the spirit that wins. The spirit, the intellect.” Vlad, 30, an IT worker, wants to avoid conscription. I think that Ukraine, unfortunately, is not ready to fight Russia. We do not have the strength, money or weapons to do so. We were not prepared for it at all. Who is to blame for this is another question. Russia has strengthened its position in the east, so it is a senseless killing of our citizens. I don’t want to go to fight. I am neither morally nor physically ready. I’ll try to avoid getting a draft notice. If I get it, the company will try to organize that I will be in the rear. I believe that I help the country, I get my salary from outside and bring foreign currency to the territory of Ukraine. So I strengthen the GDP of the country. I am more useful in this than in the war. Dmytro Kostyuk, an army lieutenant is currently undergoing rehabilitation after being wounded in July. He is willing to return to active service. I went to serve from the very beginning of the Russian invasion on February 24 (2022). At that time there was no mobilization as such, many guys rushed to the military commissariats, and I did the same. But they only accepted people if they had draft notices. I didn’t have one. However, later I found out that they were accepting people for the territorial defense, and I went there. We were in the area between Bakhmut and Klishchiivka. We were attached to the 5th Assault Brigade. The brigade was storming the Russian positions, and we went in and held those positions. That’s where I got wounded. My platoon was short of people, so we were replenished with foreign fighters, 12 in total. For some it was the romance of war, for others it was a professional activity. Many of such people are now coming to Ukraine because it is a good line in their resume. As a rule, they do not realize what they are getting into. Many people imagine our war as a gunfight with the enemy, but they don’t realize how much artillery there is, and that you sit under fire all day, every day, and may not see the enemy at all. Foreigners are a different story, because they can easily terminate a contract, unlike Ukrainians. It happened to me - almost half of the people saw everything and said, “No, no, this is too much. This is not the kind of war we signed up for.” The way it (mobilization) is done now – when they try to force someone to join, the way they hand out draft notices is very bad. For example, I am a platoon commander, why do I need a person who does not want to join the army? I don’t think very highly of such people (draft evaders), but everyone has their own way. It’s hard to judge someone without knowing their situation. Not everyone can serve, someone has to hold the notorious ‘economic front.’ We are stuck in this war and we need to replace people.","        12:00 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
109,CNN,Open AI,David Goldman,"Open AI’s overseers worried that the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that herisked a global catastrophe. So the board fired him. That may ultimately have been the logical solution. But the manner in which Altman was fired – abruptly, opaquely and without warning to some of Open AI’s largest stakeholders and partners – defied logic. And it risked inflicting more damage than if the board took no such action at all. A company’s board of directors has an obligation, first and foremost, to its shareholders. Open AI’s most important shareholder is Microsoft, the company that gave Altman & Co. $13 billion to help Bing, Office, Windows and Azure leapfrog Google and stay ahead of Amazon, IBM and other AI wannabes. Yet Microsoft was not informed of Altman’s firing until “just before” the public announcement, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the board’s ousting of its CEO. Microsoft’s stock sank after Altman was let go. Employees weren’t told the news ahead of time, either. Neither was Greg Brockman, the company’s co-founder and former president, who saidin a post on Xthat he found out about Altman’s firing moments before it happened. Brockman, a key supporter of Altman and his strategic leadership of the company, resigned Friday. Other Altman loyalists also headed for the exits. Suddenly, Open AI was in crisis. Reports that Altman and ex-Open AI loyalists were about to start their own venture risked undoing everything that the company had worked so hard to achieve over the past several years. So a day later, the boardreportedly asked for a mulliganand tried to woo Altman back. It was a shocking turn of events and an embarrassing self-own by a company that its widely regarded as the most promising producer of the most exciting new technology. The bizarre structure of Open AI’s board complicated matters. The company is a nonprofit. But Altman, Brockman and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in 2019 formed Open AI LP, a for-profit entity that exists within the larger company’s structure. That for-profit company took Open AI from worthless to a valuation of $90 billion in just a few years – and Altman is largely credited as the mastermind of that plan and the key to the company’s success. Yet a company with big backers like Microsoft and venture capital firm Thrive Capital has an obligation to grow its business and make money. Investors want to ensure they’re getting bang for their buck, and they’re not known to be a patient bunch. That probably led Altman to push the for-profit company to innovate faster and go to market with products. In the great “move fast and break things” tradition of Silicon Valley, those products don’t always work so well at first. That’s fine, perhaps, when it’s a dating app or a social media platform. It’s something entirely different when it’s a technology so good at mimicking human speech and behavior that it can fool people into believing its fake conversations and images are real. And that’s what reportedly scared the company’s board, which remained majority controlled by the nonprofit wing of the company. Swisher reported that Open AI’s recent developer conference served as an inflection point: Altmanannouncedthat Open AI would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of Chat GPT. For Sutskever and the board, that was a step too far. By Altman’s own account, the company was playing with fire. When Altman set up Open AI LP four years ago, the new company noted in itscharterthat it remained “concerned” about AI’s potential to “cause rapid change” for humanity. That could happen unintentionally, with the technology performing malicious tasks because of bad code – or intentionally by people subverting AI systems for evil purposes. So the company pledged to prioritize safety – even if that meant reducing profit for its stakeholders. Altman also urged regulators to set limits on AI to prevent people like him from inflicting serious damage on society. “Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power, and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all two greater liberty?” he said in a May Senatesubcommittee hearing, pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb – huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” Proponents of AI believe the technology has the potential to revolutionize every industry and better humanity in the process. It has the potential to improve education, finance, agriculture and health care. But it also has the potential to take jobs away from people –14 million positions could disappearin the next five years, the World Economic Forum warned in April. AI is particularly adept at spreading harmful disinformation. And some, including former Open AI board member Elon Musk, fear the technology will surpass humanity in intelligence and could wipe out life on the planet. With those threats – real or perceived – it’s no wonder the board was concerned that Altman was moving at too rapid of a pace. It may have felt obligated to get rid of him and replace him with someone who, in their view, would be more careful with the potentially dangerous technology. But Open AI isn’t operating in a vacuum. It has stakeholders, some of them with billions poured into the company. And the so-called adults in the room were acting, as Swisher put it: like a “clown car that crashed into a gold mine,” quoting a famous Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg line about Twitter. Involving Microsoft in the decision, informing employees, working with Altman on a dignified exit plan…all of those would have been solutions more typically employed by a board of a company Open AI’s size – and all with potentially better outcomes. Microsoft, despite its massive stake, does not hold an Open AI board seat, because of the company’s strange structure. Now that could change, according to multiple news reports, including the Wall Street Journaland New York Times. One of the company’s demands, including the return of Altman, is to have a seat at the table. With Open AI’s Chat GPT-like capabilities embedded in Bing and other core products, Microsoft believed it had invested wisely in the promising new tech of the future. So it must have come as a shock to CEO Satya Nadella and his crew when they learned about Altman’s firing along with the rest of the world on Friday evening. The board angered a powerful ally and could be forever changed because of the way it handled Altman’s ouster. It could end up with Altman back at the helm, a for-profit company on its nonprofit board – and a massive culture shift at Open AI. Alternatively, it could become a competitor to Altman, who may ultimately decide to start a new company and drain talent from Open AI. Either way, Open AI is probably left off in a worse position now than it was in on Friday before it fired Altman. And it was a problem it could have avoided, ironically, by slowing down.","        2:33 AM EST, Mon November 20, 2023",20.0,11.0,2023.0
110,CNN,Fighting in Myanmar,Unknown,"Renewed fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Arakan Army (AA) has displaced more than 26,000 people in the country’s western Rakhine state since Monday, according to the United Nations. In astatement Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures bring the total number of internally displaced people due to conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000. Eleven deaths and more than 30 injuries have been reported since an informal ceasefire agreed a year ago broke on November 13, the statement read. More than 100 people have reportedly been detained by the MAF and five by the AA, it added. Battlesbetween the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war. The most recent fighting began when the AA reportedly attacked two border posts near the Maungdaw township, which is near the border with Bangladesh. The two parties had previously established an informal ceasefire in November 2022, according to the UN body. It added that there have been reports of MAF shelling in AA-controlled areas and that the military had conducted at least one operation backed by air and naval support. Most humanitarian activities have been suspended due to the fighting and “virtually all roads and waterways” between Rakhine townships have been blocked, the statement read. Airstrikes and ground attacks on what the MAF calls “terrorist” targets have occurred regularly since 2021 and killed thousands of civilians, including children, according tomonitoring groups. Whole villages have been burned down by junta soldiers and schools, clinics and hospitals destroyed in the attacks.","        3:16 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
111,CNN,Airplane etiquette,Marnie Hunter,"Planes are going to be packed. Patience will be tried. Some level of aggravation is all but inevitable. Throw in a seat-kicker, a tipsy stranger and someone who’s blissfully barefoot in November and the Thanksgiving odyssey becomes a little more challenging. And this year is poised to be arecord-setter for air travel. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen more people on the Sunday after the holiday (November 26) than any day in its more than 20-year history, and some airlines are expecting their busiest Thanksgiving travel season ever. It’ll all go more smoothly if every passenger brings some common courtesy along for the ride, so CNN Travel spoke with experts about the best approaches to airplane etiquette. The missing ingredient, in many cases, is self-awareness. People tend to get wrapped up in their own journey and forget that there’s a whole planeload of other passengers. “It’s always kind of mind-blowing to see that because it’s my bag, and my overhead bin, and my seat, and my flight, my connection and, you know, my drink, and it’s very me me me when it comes to just how people behave on an airplane. “And it’s like, there’s hundreds of you,” said Rich Henderson, who’s been a flight attendant for a decade. “You’ve got to be aware of your surroundings, you’ve got to be respectful of the people around you.” Be polite to the flight crew greeting you. “It goes a long way when you’re pleasant to the first person you see on the plane,” said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas. Andrew Henderson, a flight attendant with 20 years of experience, seconds that notion. “A simple ‘hello’ or ‘thank you’ or acknowledgment of our existence is polite. I think that’s some of the etiquette that’s being lost these days with all the noise-canceling headphones and devices we’re on. We’re all so busy that we forget that humans exist in the world,” said Andrew Henderson. He is married to Rich Henderson and together they run the website and social media accounts Two Guys on a Plane, where “the sass is complimentary.” Earbuds and noise-canceling headphones are a double-edged sword: great for blocking out the world when it’s intrusive, but not so great for paying attention when it matters. “We’re there primarily for safety reasons as flight attendants and you know we often joke, but it’s not really a joke, that if there was an emergency situation, half the people would still be on the plane because they have noise-canceling headphones on and they’re in their phones and they’re not paying attention to what’s going on around them,” said Rich Henderson. “And it’s kind of scary to think about.” Passengers lost in their own world also tend to miss things like beverage service and then get annoyed that they’re skipped. “If you see a cart, a flight attendant approaching your row, take your headphones off, look up, acknowledge that they’re there so that we don’t have to have challenging situations in the future,” said Andrew Henderson. But noise canceling devices, which Gottsman called “the universal sign of ‘I don’t want to be bothered,’” obviously come in handy. Neighbor talking your ear off? Put on headphones. And they’re a savior when babies are crying. So put them on your ears and be kind. “I feel like we really need to give grace to traveling parents because we all know … it’s not the baby’s fault, and it puts the parent in such an uncomfortable situation to see people rolling their eyes,” said Gottsman. “They don’t want the baby to cry any more than we do.” But kids-gone-wild scenarios are another story. Inattentive parents frequently make lists of the most annoying behaviors on planes. “The flipside of that is parents — much like in any public space — should be expected to keep an eye on their children,” Gottsman said. “If they’re at a restaurant, if they’re in a grocery store, certainly when they’re in an airplane, for the safety of the child, for the comfort of fellow passengers. You know, be attentive to them kicking the seat in front of them.” Seat-kicking is a frequent passenger complaint, along with armrest-hogging and alaundry list of other grievances. “I think that we all just have to be a little kinder to each other. If someone’s kicking your seat, you have to be an adult and turn around and speak to the person,” said Andrew Henderson. These situations require communication to head off frustration before it happens. “So, if I know I’m a passenger that wants to have the window shade closed the whole flight, I’ll turn to my neighbor and say, ‘Does anyone want the window shade open? It’s my preference to have it closed,’” he said. And if someone else would like it open, there’s room for negotiation. Maybe they like having it open to see out during takeoff and landing but otherwise are fine having it closed. Samantha Brown, TV host and travel expert, takes a more unilateral approach to the window shade question: The window seat occupant decides. “If they would like the shade up, they keep the shade up. The aisle seat person cannot tell the window seat person to put the shade down,” she told CNN recently, and emphatically. Andrew Henderson cautions against such an approach. “If you just get on and are self-absorbed and ‘It’s my window, I’m going to close it if I want to,’ of course you’re going to start a fight that way,” he said. Proceed carefully, window seaters. As for armrests, Gottsman said the middle seat gets priority. “I always say the middle person gets both armrests – gets to choose, let’s put it that way,” she said, adding that the middle seat’s occupant should be able to decide which way they want to lean. Samantha Brown said the middle seat occupant definitely gets both armrests. “The middle seat — they get anything they want.” The seat-reclining question certainly cannot be resolved here. To recline or not to recline is a hot-button issue with many travelers on both sides. But bringing courtesy to whichever way you lean is key. Leaning backwards? “If you’re going to recline your seat back, it’s important to look backwards first and see if somebody’s knees are up against the seat, see if the tray table is down, see if they’ve got food [on the tray table],” said Gottsman. Rich Henderson believes in reclining, with a caveat. “As a general rule, I feel like a person should be able to use their seat the way that it’s designed to be used,” he said, adding that “the right thing to do” on a flight that offers meal service is to put your seat forward during that time. Some of the most egregious air rage incidents of the past few years have involved alcohol. A passenger who’s had a few drinks at the airport bar and has a few more on the plane may not make the best seatmate or customer.Some end up facing hefty fines. “I think that it’s important to drink in moderation,” said Gottman. “If you are going to drink, and that’s fine, don’t over imbibe.” There’s no escaping unpleasant odors in tight quarters, so be conscious of what you choose to bring on a plane. Think twice about fish and hard-boiled eggs, for example. “What’s smelly food to me is not smelly food to someone else, so if you hear people grumbling about your food, maybe the airplane isn’t the best place to eat your fish tacos,” said Andrew Henderson. “Or, know that you have fish tacos and apologize to the group around you that that’s what sounded good to you, ‘I’ll be as quick as I can with eating it.’” Do your personal grooming at home — do not clip your nails en route to grandma’s house. But do tend to your personal hygiene pre-flight. Smelly passengers – from poor hygiene or too much perfume or cologne, are a common complaint,surveys say. Gottsman urges passengers to choose a pair of shoes that will be comfortable throughout the flight — even if your feet swell. “It’s not OK to kick off your shoes and take a little nap,” she said. “The nap is fine, but shoes should stay on. And you don’t want to walk up and down the cabin, to the restroom and back, barefooted or in socks.” Do not, under any circumstance, put your bare feet on another person’s armrest. This happened to Brown in what she called “the most annoying passenger experience I have ever had.” “Right away I feel no problem just turning around and saying, ‘Please don’t do that,’ but first, you need to document,” she said, showing CNN viewers photos of the offending passenger’s bare feet (yup, both feet) with red toenails. That also gave the other passenger’s partner time to say, “Uh, you should remove your feet. She’s taking pictures of them.” Bottom line? “We could all do a little bit better to be nicer to each other,” said Rich Henderson, “especially in such tight quarters.”","        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
112,CNN,Sudan conflict,Unknown,"Mahdi, 16, was blindfolded when a strange man felt for his biceps. He was looking for a “strong” boy to use as a farmhand. The size of his muscles helped the man determine Mahdi’s price as he bought him from a militiaman who had captured him in the West Darfur capital of El Geneina. “They hit me and called me a slave. And they kept hitting me,” Mahdi said of his captors and other unknown men. “I’d crouch down and they’d smack me in the neck.” His harrowing testimony was among dozens – including accounts from women who alleged sexual enslavement – collected as part of an exclusive documentary by CNN about the humanitarian toll exacted by the ongoing fight between Sudan’s ruling military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The documentary, which will air this Sunday on “The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper,” exposes an RSF-led campaign to enslave men and women in El Geneina, the largest city controlled by the paramilitary group in Sudan’s Darfur region. A CNN team in the Chadian refugee camp of Adre, across the border from El Geneina, spoke to over a dozen witnesses who described the abduction of people en masse, with women forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for food and water and both men and women being traded by their captors. Their accounts shed further light on the violence in the genocide-scarred western Sudanese region over the past five months. To protect the witnesses and survivors, CNN is not identifying them by their real names. The apparent atrocities peaked after the RSF — which a CNN investigation has shown is backed by Russian mercenary group Wagner —captured El Geneina in mid-June. In the days that followed, a man named Khalid said he saw RSF-uniformed fighters escorting over a dozen shackled women into the El Geneina Industrial School, where he worked as a teacher. “They flogged them with whips that they use on animals while the girls were screaming,” said Khalid, who told CNN he watched the scene unfold from his hiding place behind a pile of chopped wood in the school compound. He only came out of hiding when night fell. Throughout the day, he said, he saw the fighters forcing women into classrooms at gunpoint, after which he said he heard sounds that indicated torture and rape. Many of the women, Khalid said, appeared to have been trafficked from further north in Sudan — where women’s style of dress can display relative affluence, and where the tribal and racial mix is typified by generally lighter complexions. Several Sudan-based rights groups, including the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA) and the government’s Combating Violence Against Women Unit, have told CNN that they believe the RSF abducted dozens of women from the capital, Khartoum, trafficking them to the paramilitary group’s strongholds in Darfur. Rights group activists say they have spoken to scores of local sources who said the women appeared to have been sexually exploited by the RSF. In Adre, CNN spoke to four other witnesses, in addition to Khalid, who said they saw evidence of RSF trafficking women from northern Sudan. One former abductee from Darfur— who CNN is not naming — said she saw a 4x4 vehicle roll up into an Arab neighborhood in El Geneina, carrying four women who appeared to be northern Sudanese women in the back. She said she saw an RSF fighter approach the driver and ask how much he was willing to “sell” the women for. She recalled hearing the driver boast that he had “handpicked the women” and that “no amount of cash” would make him release them to the RSF fighter. ‘To us you are all slaves’ The trafficking of women from Arab-majority areas in the north of the country has become a widely discussed practice in Sudan, with widespread reports of RSF fighters demanding ransoms for their release. In Darfur, captured women from non-Arab tribes appear to have been treated differently — the apparent sexual exploitation of women tends to involve shorter periods of captivity, and their abuse is reported by dozens of witnesses, survivors and activists to be racially fuelled. The RSF, a largely Arab fighting force that has been accused of ethnically cleansing non-Arab tribes in Darfur, is widely named as the culprit of wide-scale sexual exploitation there. The RSF has not responded to CNN’s request for comment about allegations of sexual enslavement. The paramilitary group has previously denied allegations of conducting an ethnic cleansing campaign and committing sexual violence, in Darfur. According toa Human Rights Watch reportpublished in August, the RSF raped “several dozen women and girls” in El Geneina between late April and late June. “The assailants appear to have targeted people because of their Masalit ethnicity and, in some cases, because they were known activists,” the report said. Several former Darfuri abductees told CNN that fighters from the RSF and their Arab militia allies hurled racist abuse at them during their captivity. One 22-year-old woman named Raghm said she was kidnapped by an RSF-uniformed fighter from her home and detained in a brothel. She said she heard her captor receiving money in exchange for her enslavement in the brothel — up to 7,000 Sudanese pounds, the equivalent of $10. “He said to me: ‘To us you all are slaves. To us you are not free,’” said Raghm, who belongs to the Masalit tribe, the main target of the RSF’s revived apparent ethnic cleansing campaign. Between beatings, she said she recalled him saying: “You are dirt. You are a disgrace.” In Arabic, the word for ‘slave’ is a racial slur equivalent to the n-word. Another woman told CNN she and the female members of her family were raped in captivity for four days. “They locked my mother, myself, and my sisters up for four days and they raped us,” said 20-year-old Hawa. “On the fifth day, we fled. We saw some of (the Arab militia) on the street and they flogged us with whips. They told us to run for our lives, and cursed us, calling us donkeys and goats. “The children were exhausted, barely walking a few steps before they collapsed,” she said. CNN also found evidence of the enslavement of males as part of the attack on El Geneina. Mahdi, the 16-year-old boy, told CNN he was kidnapped by the RSF with his brother and that he heard RSF fighters negotiating his “price” to work as a farmhand. He listened to the back-and-forth between his captors and other men while he was blindfolded, his hand and feet bound by rope. They felt his biceps because they said they “wanted a strong one,” he told CNN. He said he spent 10 days in the house that he was sold to before escaping and making it to the relative safety of Chad. The brother who was taken at the same time as him was killed by the RSF, he said. The documentary to be aired Sunday is the latest in a series of CNN investigations into atrocities committed by the RSF in Sudan. In recent months, CNN has uncovered how the Russian mercenary group Wagner has backed the RSF throughout this war, as well as evidence of arbitrary executions, wholesale destruction of homes, and forced displacement of Sudanese civilians.","        6:19 AM EST, Mon November 20, 2023",20.0,11.0,2023.0
113,CNN,World’s ‘most sought-after’ whisky,Unknown,"For those who appreciate the finer tipples in life, a bottle of the world’s “most sought-after Scotchwhisky” sold for more than £2.1 million ($2.7 million) Saturday at Sotheby’s in London. The Macallan 1926 is one of just 40 bottles drawn after ageing in sherry casks for 60 years, making it the oldest Macallan vintage ever produced,according to the auction house. Sotheby’s had expected it to raise between £750,000 and £1.2 million ($934,274 and $1.4 million), but were in for a shock when the prized bottle fetched a whooping £2,187,500 ($2,724,967), making it a “new record for any bottle of spirit or wine sold at auction,” the auction house told AFP news agency. Ahead of the sale, Sotheby’s head of whisky Jonny Fowle told AFP that he had tried a small sample. “I tasted a tiny drop - a tiny drop - of this. It’s very rich, it’s got a lot of dried fruit as you would expect, a lot of spice, a lot of wood,” he said, calling it an “incredible” whisky that should not be taken lightly. Of the 40 bottles filled in 1986, none were made available for purchase, with some instead being offered to The Macallan’s top clients, a luxury that adds to its appeal, as evidenced in previous sales of the bottles, its description on Sotheby’s website added. In 2019, Sotheby’s sold a bottle of The Macallan 1926adorned with one of 14 Fine and Rare labels, for £1.5 million ($1.9 million), at the time making it the most expensive bottle of wine or spirit ever auctioned. Saturday’s sale was one of 12 bottles covered with a label designed by Italian painter Valerio Adami, a bottle of which is also believed to have been destroyed during the 2011 Japanese earthquake. This bottle is also the first of The Macallan 1926 bottles to have undergone reconditioning, carried out by The Macallan Distillery in Scotland before the auction. A further 12 were labelled by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, while the remaining two were released unlabelled. Of the unlabelled, one was hand painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon, and became the first bottle of whiskey to surpass £1 million ($1.2 million) when itsold in 2018 for £1.2 million($1.5 million), the auction house said on its website.","        9:12 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
114,CNN,Israel Defense Forces,"ByHeather Chen,Andrew Raine, Antoinette Radford and Seán Federico O'Murchú, CNN"," Our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has moved here.   Even in the darkness, the utter devastation in northern Gaza is clear as day. The empty shells of buildings, illuminated by the last shreds of light, lurch out of the landscape on the dirt roads across the Gaza Strip. At night, the only signs of life are the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles that rumble the landscape, tightening the military’s grip on the northern sector. On Saturday night, we traveled with the IDF into Gaza to see the newly exposed tunnel shaft discovered at the compound of Al-Shifa Hospital, the enclave’s largest medical facility. The IDF had promised “concrete evidence” that Hamas was using the hospital complex above ground as cover for what it called terror infrastructure underneath, including a command and control hub. Standing on the edge of the tunnel shaft, it was apparent that the structure itself was substantial. At the top, the remains of a ladder hung over the lip of the opening. In the center of the round shaft, a center pole looked like a hub for a spiral staircase. The shaft itself extended down farther than we could see, especially in the meager light of our headlamps. Video released by the IDF from inside the shaft is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Gaza’s largest hospital, but it is clear that there is a tunnel down below. Seeing what connects to that tunnel is absolutely critical. Hamas has repeatedly denied that there is a network of tunnels below Shifa hospital. Health officials who have spoken with CNN have said the same, insisting it is only a medical facility. As is so rarely the case in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this answer truly is black and white. Either there is an underground series of tunnels below the hospital. Or there is not. Some context:CNN reported from inside Gaza under IDF media escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join this embed, media outlets had to submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review and agreed not to reveal sensitive locations and soldiers’ identities. CNN retained editorial control over the final report. Read more here.   Doctors from Al-Helal Al-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah, in southern Gaza who are treating 31 neonatal babies who were evacuated from Gaza City say all the babies are fighting serious infections, according to a statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday.  Eleven of the young babies are in ""critical condition,"" the WHO said in their statement.  The WHO said the babies had fallen ill due to a lack of medical supplies at Al-Shifa Hospital and the difficulty of continuing infection control measures in Al-Shifa Hospital amid an ongoing Israeli assault.  Dr. Mohammad Salamah at the Al-Helal Al-Emirati Maternity Hospital told CNN: ""We are conducting tests on all those babies and they were given fluids and needed medication according to their condition. For now, they are in a difficult, stable condition, but this condition might deteriorate, especially given that we might run out of electricity at any time now as long as fuel doesn’t get into Gaza.""  ""Six health workers and 10 of their family members, who had been sheltering at the hospital, were also evacuated,"" WHO said.  It was hoped that the parents of the newborns would be able to travel to safety with their children, but the WHO said very few of the infants were accompanied by family members.  This was because Gazan officials were not easily able to find close family members due to the intense fighting between Israel and Hamas and communications blackouts.  CNN spoke to one father, Ali Sbeiti, who managed to be reunited with his young son, Anas, who was born three days before the war.  ""Thank God. We now feel that our son is safe after not seeing him for more than two weeks. We didn’t know whether he was dead or alive, especially when communications were disconnected with the doctors,"" Sbeiti said.   The Israel Defense Forces has released CCTV videos and still images it says show Hamas fighters bringing hostages into the Al-Shifa Hospitalon October 7. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari presented two short videos, along with several still images, which he said show Hamas fighters moving the hostages – one Nepali, one Thai – through the hospital, Gaza's largest. One of the CCTV videos shows a hostage being brought into the hospital through the main entrance, Hagari said. The hostage is being marched by force through the building. Hagari, at a news conference Sunday, said the second CCTV video shows a second hostage – who has a bandaged hand and is clearly bleeding – being pushed on a gurney down a hallway and into a room. Hagari did not spell out how the IDF had acquired the videos, although he did say Israeli intelligence officers were part of the operation inside the hospital to try to locate the hostages. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the videos and the stills.   Opposing narratives:The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry responded to the IDF briefing by questioning the authenticity of the videos and stills — but went on to say that, if true, the pictures showed that hospitals were providing medical care to anyone who needed it. The IDF spokesman dismissed suggestions the hostages had been brought to the hospital because they were wounded, claiming one of the two hostages was not injured and did not need medical treatment. They had been brought to the hospital first, before being later moved to hiding spots, like nearby apartments, he said. “If medical care had been given at the hospital, if the hostages had remained there, then the Red Cross would have come, and the people would have been released. None of these things happened,” he said. In a statement issued Saturday before the release of the CCTV videos, Hamas said it had brought several hostages to hospitals for medical treatment after they were injured in Israeli airstrikes. Hagari said the latest videos had been shared with diplomats of the hostages’ countries of origin, adding the IDF has not yet located the Nepali and Thai hostages in Gaza. The Nepali Embassy in Israel and Nepal’s Foreign Ministry had confirmed with CNN before the publication of the video that one Nepali citizen remained missing after the October 7 attack and was believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Ten Nepali citizens were killed and several others injured when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, Nepal's ambassador to Israel told CNN after the attack. More context:After raiding Al-Shifa Hospital last Wednesday, the IDF isunder tremendous pressureto prove its long-standing assertion that Hamas uses Gaza's largest medical center for combat and command purposes. The military also released video Sunday from inside an exposed tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa compound, showing an underground tunnel extending downward from the shaft opening. Thekilling of civilians in Gaza schoolsand largeevacuations from Al-Shifa Hospitalare actions that fly in the face of basic protections civilians are afforded under international law, the United Nation's top human rights official said Sunday. The Israeli military has previously pushed back againstaccusations of war crimes, saying its strikes on what it says are Hamas targets follow international law and that it seeks to minimize civilian casualties. Türk called the events of the past two days horrendous, saying they beggar belief. He said hundreds of people have fled Al-Shifa Hospital and were seen heading south, but warned, “Nowhere is safe in Gaza.”   He also said that in Khan Younis in southern Gaza — where hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled — the IDF has beendropping leaflets, telling residents to go to unspecified shelters, but he stressed, “Irrespective of warnings, Israel is obliged to protect civilians wherever they are.” Türk again called for an immediate ceasefire on humanitarian and human rights grounds. “The pain, dread, and fear etched on the faces of children, women and men is too much to bear,” he said. “How much more violence, bloodshed and misery will it take before people come to their senses? How many more civilians will be killed? This must stop.” The Israel Defense Forces released videofrom inside an exposed tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza City, showing an underground tunnel extending downward from the shaft opening. For weeks, the IDF has said Hamas uses Gaza’s largest hospital as cover for what they call terror infrastructure underneath, which Hamas and hospital leaders deny. But having entering the hospital itself, the IDF is under significant pressure to prove the long-standing assertion with its promise of “concrete evidence.” Here’s what you need to know:   A recent draft of a possible deal tosecure the release of hostagesthat Hamas is holding in Gaza proposes a four- to five-day pause in fighting for the initial release of 50 hostages, two sources familiar with the talks tell CNN. An agreement has yet to be struck, and the text of a deal has been traded back and forth for weeks. But negotiators hailing from various countries, including senior officials in US President Joe Biden's administration, areexpressing rare optimismabout the progress. While the talks could still break down and sticking points remain, an agreement may now be days away, sources say. In a sign of how tenuous the talks have been, two sources told CNN Hamas has at least once abruptly put the negotiations on hold recently over various objections, one of which is Israel’s raid of Al-Shifa Hospitalin Gaza. But the discussions eventually picked back up. Sticking points:There are still details to be worked out over aid, with Israel expressing concern that aid could go to help Hamas, rather than civilians. Hamas initially requested 500 trucks of aid per day, one of the sources said. One source said that, while discussions are ongoing, a deal involving more than 200 trucks would be logistically challenging. There are also questions about how to inspect the trucks and which points of entry to use. The aid would include fuel and cooking oil for bakeries, and continue to flow in after the initial pauses for hostages. Staggered releases:The most recent discussions involve plans for staggered releases of the hostages, with pauses potentially increasing after an initial release of a significant number of civilians, according to the sources. Israel has presented a list of about 100 names of civilian hostages that it wants included in the agreement, one source told CNN. Israel has publicly demanded that all hostages be released. Hamas has indicated it would be willing to release 50 hostages over a multi-day pause. More hostages, around 20 to 25, could be released after that, as the pauses are extended. Hamas has said it needs pauses in fighting to gather the hostages who are being held in different places and by different Hamas-allied groups in Gaza. The US National Security Council and Israeli Embassy to the US declined to comment for this story. The Qatari Embassy to the US didn’t respond immediately for comment. CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed reporting to this post.  CNN's Oren Liebermann went to the scene of what the Israel Defense Forces says is an exposed Hamas tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa Hospital compound. For weeks, the IDF has said Hamas uses Gaza’s largest hospital as cover for what they call terror infrastructure underneath. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied that the hospital, which the IDF raided last Wednesday, is anything other than a medical complex. CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join the embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for review. Watch Liebermann's report from the hospital compound below:  The Israeli military has released video from inside an exposed tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza City, showing an underground tunnel extending downward from the shaft opening. The video, which runs 3 minutes and 27 seconds and was filmed on Friday, Nov. 17, begins outside the tunnel shaft with several Israel Defense Forces soldiers visible in the opening shot. The video then shows the soldiers preparing to lower equipment into the shaft to examine the interior. There is no audio throughout the clip. As the camera is lowered into the shaft, a set of spiral stairs becomes visible around a central pole. The camera then begins advancing along the tunnel before coming to a sharp left turn. The walls of the tunnel appear to be made of vertical slabs of concrete, with an arched concrete roof. After the turn, the tunnel continues before coming to a closed metal door with what appears to be a small viewing window. The IDF says it has not yet opened the door because the military fears it may be booby-trapped. The IDF says the tunnel shaft extends 10 meters (just over 30 feet) underground and the tunnel itself continues for 55 meters (180 feet). “This type of door is used by the Hamas terrorist organization to block Israeli forces from entering the command centers and the underground assets belonging to Hamas,” the IDF and the Israel Security Agency claimed in a statement Sunday evening. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied that the hospital is anything other than a medical complex. Key context:For weeks, the IDF has said Hamas uses Gaza’s largest hospital as cover for what they call terror infrastructure underneath. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Hamas has a command and control center or headquarters underneath the hospital, which other senior Israeli officials have also insisted on. But having entering the hospital itself, the IDF is under tremendous pressure to prove the long-standing assertion with its promise of “concrete evidence.” The exposure of the tunnel shaft and video of the tunnel underground is part of the IDF trying to build its case that Hamas uses the hospital for its own purposes. The IDF’s ability to continue its operation in Gaza, and the credibility of Israel, are at stake as the number killed in Gaza surpasses 12,000, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. The IDF says one of its missions in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, but withinternational criticism mounting, Israel has to show conclusively that the terror organization is using Gaza’s civilians and infrastructure as cover in order for Israel to justify an ongoing war.","November 20, 2023 14:00",,,
115,CNN,Biden threatens visa bans against ‘extremists attacking civilians’ in the West Bank,Aileen Graef,"President Joe Bidencalled for a stop to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank in an op-ed published Saturday, signaling that the US is prepared to issue visa bans, and again committed to pursuing a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. “This much is clear: A two-state solution is the only way to ensure the long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people,”Biden wrotein The Washington Post. The president’s warning comes amid concerns over Israel violating the Visa Waiver Program, which allows eligible travelers to apply to enter the US without a visa.Israel joinedthe program in late October. “I have been emphatic with Israel’s leaders that extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and that those committing the violence must be held accountable,” Biden wrote. “The United States is prepared to take our own steps, including issuing visa bans against extremists attacking civilians in the West Bank.” The State Department acknowledged the concerns earlier this week, with spokesperson Matt Miller sharing that “there are remedial measures that are available to us” if Israel does not comply with the program. Biden also in the op-ed rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, maintaining a position he has held since the Israel-Hamas conflictbegan early last month. Instead, the president stressed the need for a two-state solution and governance under the Palestinian Authority in the meantime. “A two-state solution — two peoples living side by side with equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity — is where the road to peace must lead. Reaching it will take commitments from Israelis and Palestinians, as well as from the United States and our allies and partners,” he wrote. Biden has previously endorsed a two-state solution to the decadeslong tensions between Israel and Palestinians. “We must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely and securely in dignity and in peace,”he said last monthduring an address in Tel Aviv. “For me, that means a two-state solution. We must keep working for Israel’s greater integration with its neighbors.” The Washington Post op-ed is the latest effort from the White House to remind Americans that conflicts abroad affect US national security as the administration’s supplemental request remains stalled. Last month, the Biden administration requested more than $105 billion from Congress as part of a package it said will provide security assistance for the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. At the time, Biden made an impassioned plea for the funding in aprime-time Oval Office address, calling the moment “an inflection point” in American history. The president underscored that message in his op-ed Saturday and attempted to highlight the similarities between the two wars. “Both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe a neighboring democracy off the map,” Biden wrote. “And both Putin and Hamas hope to collapse broader regional stability and integration and take advantage of the ensuing disorder.” “America cannot, and will not, let that happen. For our own national security interests — and for the good of the entire world,” he added. Biden closed with condemning the rising antisemitism and Islamophobia since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began. “We can’t stand by when hate rears its head,” he said. “We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate and bias. We must renounce violence and vitriol and see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.” This story has been updated with additional information.","        9:50 PM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
116,CNN,Video shows dozens of bodies after alleged attack at UN-run school in Gaza,Jo Shelley,"A school run by the United Nations in northern Gaza has been hit with apparently devastating impact, the UN confirmed Saturday, in what a top UN official described as a “horrifying” incident. Video from al-Fakhoura School in Jabalya – which was being used as a shelter for displaced people – shows bloodied bodies across a series of rooms on two floors of the two-story building. Many women and children are among the dead. One room appears to contain about a dozen bodies lying on the floor covered in dust. Desks are strewn and smashed up and a huge hole can be seen in one of the room’s walls. In the building courtyard, a canopy roof across a metal structure appears to have been torn off, and debris is visible on the ground. Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which runs the schools in Palestinian refugee camps and serves as the main UN relief agency in Gaza, confirmed the incident. The total number of casualties remains unclear, she said, as information is still coming in. Touma could not confirm what caused the incident, nor who was responsible. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, who called the images “horrifying” in a post on X (formerly Twitter), saidthousands of displaced peoplehad been sheltering there at the time of the incident. The Israeli military is reviewing the incident, it told CNN, but had no further comment. Egypt and Qatar have already blamed Israel’s military campaign in the battered enclave for the incident. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry called it a “bombing”, and said it was the latest in a series of Israeli violations against civilians in Gaza. Qatar called onindependent investigatorsfrom the United Nations to go to Gaza to examine what it described as the “ongoing targeting of schools and hospitals.” Saturday’s incident was the second time in twenty-four hours an UNRWA school in northern Gaza had been hit, the agency said. Another school in Zaitoun was sheltering 4,000 people when it was struck multiple times on Friday, Touma told CNN. She added that ambulances had reportedly been unable to get to the school, which she said was most likely due to the fighting and the communications blackout. Dozens of people were likely killed in that incident, according to Lazzarini, who wrote: “These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop. A humanitarian ceasefire cannot wait any longer,” he added. The UN’s Secretary-General António Guterres reiterated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in a statement on Sunday. “I am deeply shocked that two UNRWA schools were struck in less than 24 hours in Gaza. Dozens of people – many women and children – were killed and injured as they were seeking safety in United Nations premises,” Guterres said. “Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians are seeking shelter at United Nations facilities throughout Gaza due to the intensified fighting. I reaffirm that our premises are inviolable.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk also called for an immediate ceasefire, saying that the killing of civilians in Gaza schools and large evacuations from Al-Shifa Hospital fly in the face of basic protections for civilians under international law. “Rules of international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out the attacks, must be strictly adhered to,” he said. “Failure to adhere to these rules may constitute war crimes.” Türk said that in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, the IDF has been dropping leaflets, telling residents to go to unspecified shelters. However, he stressed that warnings alone are not enough under international law. “Irrespective of warnings, Israel is obliged to protect civilians wherever they are,” he said. The Israeli military has previously pushed back against accusations of war crimes, saying its strikes are intended to target Hamas, and that it tries to minimize civilian casualties.

117,CNN,Matias Delacroix/AP,David Shortell,"Javier Milei has won Argentina’s presidential elections in provisional results, wrenching his country to the right with a bombastic anti-establishment campaign that drewcomparisonsto that of former US President Donald Trump – all against the backdrop of one of the world’s highest inflation rates. His rival Sergio Massa conceded the run-off vote on Sunday evening in a brief speech even before official results were announced. “Milei is the president elected for the next 4 years,” said Massa, adding that he had already called Milei to congratulate him. Provisional results so far show Milei with over 55% of votes (13,781,154) with more than 94% of votes counted, according to data from the country’s National Electoral Chamber, which has not yet declared an official winner. Milei’s victory marks an extraordinary rise for the former TV pundit, who entered the race as a political outsider on a promise to “break up with the status quo” – exemplified by Sergio Massa. His campaign promise to dollarize Argentina, if enacted, is expected to thrust the country into new territory: no country of Argentina’s size has previously turned over the reins of its own monetary policy to Washington decisionmakers. Shortly after the results were announced, Milei was greeted by cheers and thunderous applause from his supporters as he took to the stage and gave a fiery speech, pledging to take the country into a new political era. “Today we turn the page on our history and we return to the path that we should never have lost,” Milei said. “Today we retake the path that made this country great.” Milei, a social conservative with ties to the American right, opposes abortion rights and has called climate change a “lie of socialism.” He has promised to slash government spending by closing Argentina’s ministries of culture, education, and diversity, and by eliminating public subsidies. “Make Argentina great again!” Trump posted on his platform Truth Social Sunday, in reaction to Milei’s win. “I am very proud of you,” he wrote. Similarities to Trump have not gone unnoticed in the United States as it prepares for its own presidential elections. Milei succeeded in attracting attention at home not only because of his political style – including wielding chainsaws and raging outbursts – but also because of the novelty of his positions and eagerness to upset the status quo. Echoing the Trumpian slogan, ‘Drain the swamp’, Milei’s supporters shout “¡¡Qué se vayan todos!!” which translates as “May they all leave!” – an expression of fury at politicians from both sides of the spectrum. Argentina’s left is currently in government, following rule by the right from 2015 to 2019. Outside of his controversial plan for dollarization, Milei’s political program includes slashing regulations on gun control and transferring authority over the penitentiary system from civilians to the military; both measures part of a tough-on-crime approach. He proposes using public funds to support families who choose to educate their children privately and even privatizing the health sector, which in Argentina has always been in public hands. Several outspoken comments landed Milei in hot water, without deterring his most ardent supporters. He triggered an uproar when it appeared Milei was in favor of opening a market for organ transplants, although he later retracted his declarations. He was similarly forced to apologize after calling Pope Francis, who is from Argentina and is seen as an icon of progressive politics in South America, “an envoy of Satan” in 2017. Milei’s unexpected political ascent will be closely scrutinized around the world as a potential sign of a resurgence of far-right populism in the region. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro endorsed Milei’s candidacy, while leftist leaders in the region – including current Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro – abandoned a tradition of non-intervention to back Massa in the election run-up. Public opinion polls had shown the two candidates neck-and-neck in recent weeks. The candidacy of Massa, a lifelong politician, came to represent Argentina’s political establishment over the course of the race against Milei. Inflation reached painful heights during his tenture as economy minister, at 142% year on year, but Massa argued that the current government’s actions were working to temper the pain – an argument that failed to convince voters exhausted by a cost-of-living crisis. This is a breaking news story and will be updated.","        1:58 AM EST, Mon November 20, 2023",20.0,11.0,2023.0
118,CNN,Milei’s victory puts the peso’s future in doubt,Unknown,"Libertarian Javier Milei’s victory Sundayin Argentina’s presidential run-off contesthas far-reaching consequences for the country’s struggling economy, including the fate of the peso. A political outsider who ran on a promise to “break the status quo,” Milei’s economic platform rested on a desire to dollarize the Argentinian economy.Dollarization means the country wouldgive up the Argentine pesoand use the US dollar as its currency. If enacted, the policy would hurl the nation into unknown territory: No country of Argentina’s size has previously turned over the reins of its own monetary policy to Washington decisionmakers. Ecuador and El Salvador have also dollarized their economies to combat inflation. Argentina has one of the world’s highest inflation rates; data released last week showed that prices rose 142% year-over-year.Milei’s proposal to switch Argentina’s currency from the peso to the US dollar rests on the argument that the dollar is stronger than the peso and, unlike the peso, cannot be printed at will. His vision has drawn international attention and a number of warnings from critics, who refer to the move as a straightjacket, saying that dollarization results in a country losing autonomy to influence the economy through monetary policy moves such as interest rate changes. Sergio Massa, the country’s current economy minister and Milei’s run-offopponent, had criticized the plan for dollarization as a surrender of national sovereignty. Proponents of the plan, including analysts from the Cato Institute, a libertarian economic think tank based in Washington, DC, favor the move as a practical strategy to tame what has been a decades-long problem.

119,CNN,Opinion Here’s what was magic about the Carter marriage,Unknown,"Editor’s Note:Kate Andersen Brower is the author of “The Residence,” “First Women,” “Team Of Five” and “First In Line.” She covered the Obama administration for Bloomberg News. The views expressed here are her own. Readmore opinionat CNN. President Biden and Jill Biden traveled to Plains, Georgia in April 2021 to meet with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter —their first meeting since the recently-inaugurated Biden had taken office. But when the get-together was over, it was Rosalynn — not Jimmy — who took the lead escorting the first couple out the door of the Carters’ modest ranch home. As with so many things, Rosalynn — a true equal in all things over the course of the Carters’ 77-year marriage — took the reins in matters great and small, including seeing out their illustrious guests so that her husband could enjoy his regularly scheduled swim. It also allowed the famously media-averse former president to avoid the scrum of reporters waiting outside to hear how the visit had gone. Rosalynn Carter was a paragon of strength and resilience in a marriage that was in all ways a true partnership. Herdeath was announced by the Carter Centeron Sunday, which said she had passed away with loved ones at her bedside. Carter once referred to his marriage to Rosalynn as “the pinnacle of my life.” On Sunday, the former president eulogized his late wife as a consummate companion and unwavering support. “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Carter said. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.” Rosalynn Carter’s death at the age of 96 came two days after the Carter Centerannouncedthat the former first lady had entered hospice care. She was diagnosed with dementia in May. Former President Carter began home hospice care in February, following a series of hospital stays. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were married for more than 77 years — longer than any president and first lady in US history. They were wed at a Methodist church in their tiny town of Plains, Georgia, on July 7, 1946, when she was 18 and he was 21. At the time of her death, the former first couple had lived as husband and wife for about the same amount of time as the average American’s life expectancy. Jimmy Carter was the son of a peanut farmer with little name recognition outside of Georgia before he ran for president, and Rosalynn was his most ardent supporter. Ahead of the 1976 Democratic nomination a group of Georgia volunteers, known asthe Peanut Brigade,campaigned door-to-door for him, while Rosalynn traveled to television and radio stations around the country, surprising them by offering herself up for interviews so that she could slowly, town by town, state by state, introduce voters to her husband. Growing up, boys never interested Rosalynn much. “I didn’t know how to talk to them, I didn’t want to go out with them,”she once said, adding  that she used to urge her mother to tell prospective suitors who called on the telephone that she wasn’t around. It was different however, when she visited her neighbor’s house and saw a photo of Jimmy Carter on the bedroom wall. Ruth — Carter’s sister -— happened to be Rosalynn’s best friend. “[A]long came Jimmy Carter and my life has been an adventure ever since,”she said, sitting by her husband’s side at their large anniversary celebration a couple of years ago. Rosalynn always felt that her most important job as first lady was to convey people’s biggest concerns to her husband. And once they got to the White House, the first couple had weekly lunches together so that they could have uninterrupted private time to discuss what was happening in the country. “Whatever secrets there were,” Carter’s late Vice President Walter Mondale once told me, “she knew about all of them.” That kind of intimacy could be unnerving, even for longtime aides. “They used to read the Bible in Spanish,” said Carter’s communications director Gerald Rafshoon, in awe but somewhat rueful of their close relationship. “Hamilton [Hamilton Jordan, Carter’s chief of staff] and I would really get worried when we’d be in a meeting with the Carters and if the subject was a little bit touchy, if we were advocating something — all of a sudden they’d start speaking to each other in Spanish,” Rafshoon said, noting that neither he nor Jordan spoke the language. She was always his tireless champion. When her husband lost his reelection bid to Republican challenger Ronald Reagan in 1980, Rosalynn said that she was “bitter enough for both of us.” Even years later, in a 1999 interview with the New York Times, she said that the “biggest regret in life was that Jimmy was defeated.” And when I interviewed her in 2018, she said she still thought the American people had made a mistake. After the Carters left the White House in January 1981, they made the unusual decision to return to their hometown, where they embarked on the longest, most ambitious, and most successful post-presidency in American history. Jimmy Carter was not interested in following the playbook of other former presidents who make enormous amounts of money through paid speeches and sitting on corporate boards. “How much money I make a year is not important to me,” he said after leaving the White House as he tried to decide on next steps. The low-profile but deeply impactful life that they ultimately chose for Carter’s post presidency was also very much in keeping with Rosalynn’s understated style. The former president came up with the idea for the Carter Centerand based the organization in Atlanta, about two-and-a-half hours from Plains. The Center’s mission is far-reaching; it works to “wage peace, fight disease and build hope.” Throughout the decades, the couple could be found many Sundays at the Maranatha Baptist Church, where the former president always drew large crowds for his Bible study class. “Most of us in the church would jump in front of a bullet to protect either of them,” said longtime friend Jill Stuckey. Through everything, they were always unflinchingly honest about the challenges of their unique and enduring partnership. But that’s not to say it was always easy for them. In a1987 interviewwith the Los Angeles Times, the couple joked that the closest they ever came to getting a divorce was when they worked together on the self-help book “Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life.” Rosalynn was a slow and methodical writer, while husband wrote at a quick clip. Neither could appreciate the other’s methods and writing style. Things got so bad that the two barely spoke while they were working on the book. Passages in the manuscript were labeled “Jimmy” and “Rosalynn” to indicate who was responsible for which paragraph. Somehow, though, their fabled partnership survived that trial. In Jimmy Carter’s post-presidency, the Carters have championed democracy and political stability,traveling to hot spotsincluding Cuba, Sudan and North Korea. They arranged peace talks between Ethiopian leaders and Eritrean rebels, and they denounced rigged elections in countries around the world. They’ve also made incalculable contributions to global public health. The Carter Center has helped fight several preventable diseases, includingguinea worm. In 1986, the disease afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people a year in 21 countries in Africa and Asia. Since the Carter Center and its partners have been involved,guinea worm has been nearly eradicated. The former president won the Nobel Peace Prizein 2002 for “for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.” But those who know the couple best say that it’s an honor that Rosalynn should have shared. They were always — and in all ways — a team. “The Carter Center is a shared legacy,” Stuckey told me. Throughout it all, Rosalynn has “been there digging latrines right next to him.”","        8:51 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
120,CNN,"Gripped by drought, this island is running out of drinking water",Unknown,"When Racha Mousdikoudine opens her kitchen faucet, she never knows what will happen. “Maybe I won’t get any water at all,” she told CNN. “Maybe I’ll get 30 minutes of water. Maybe the water will only come after hours of waiting.” For the last four months, Mousdikoudine and her two children have had little or no running water in their home on the French territory of Mayotte, and island of around 310,000 people in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa, between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Mayotte is facing an unprecedented water crisis amid one of the worst droughts in its history, as the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis collide with a chronic lack of investment in the water system. The island is grappling with itsworst drought since 1997. Its two water reservoirs have reached a “critical level of decline” – one is at 7% of capacity and the other at 6%, according to the most recent estimates, and they are on the verge of drying up. It has led to drastic water cuts. Residents only have access to water foraround 18 hours at a timeevery couple of days, according to a schedule published by the Prefecture, the local subdivision of the French government. Many say what little water they have is often contaminated and undrinkable. Residents have had to cope with school closures and a growing health crisis, all while water bottles become a rare – and expensive – commodity on supermarket shelves. Though 5,000 miles away from mainland France, under French law, Mayotte is as French as the suburbs of Paris. Colonized by France in1841, the island was formally recognized as a French department in 2011, meaning it has the same legal status as the 96 departments that make up mainland France. The French government has responded to the crisis. In September, it shipped 600,000 liters of bottled water to the island for its most vulnerable residents and has deployed  soldiers and civil servants to help with water distribution. The government has also suspended water bills for all residents. But many Mahorais – the term used to refer to people from Mayotte – still feel abandoned. Douainda Attoumani, 27, is scared of what the future might hold. She lives in a household of 10, with her parents, her sister, four brothers and two cousins. Every day is harder than the last, she told CNN. “The authorities seem absent in our daily suffering,” she said, adding, “when we have no water, what are we actually going to do? We’re going to die of thirst.” Many, like Mousdikoudine, are angry. “I’m a French woman, but one without any autonomy, because I have no water,” she said. “I have to choose between going to look for water for my family and going to work. In a country like France, having to make these kinds of decisions, it’s unimaginable.” The simple acts of washing or pouring glasses of water for her daughters, ages 7 and 9, became such a huge challenge she and her husband decided to send the children to live with their grandmother in the French territory of La Réunion, about a two-hour flight from Mayotte. The decision was extremely difficult, Mousdikoudine said, but she felt she had no choice. “It got to the point where I could no longer ensure the safety of my children. Cook them proper meals, take care of their hygiene, things like going to the toilet, washing.” Water in Mayotte is not only scarce, but what’s available is often contaminated. Online, residents use the hashtag#Mayotte ASoif(Mayotte is thirsty) to share videos of the brown, sediment-filled liquid that emerges from their taps. Some, including Mousdikoudine, have taken to the streets in protest. The Regional Health Authority (ARS) in Mayotte has identified several instances of contaminated water. As of mid-October, the cases of “non-compliant” water were at around 3%, ARS general manager Olivier Brahic told CNN. Many residents, however, believe the water quality issue to be a much bigger problem. Estelle Youssouffa, a lawmaker for Mayotte in the French National Assembly, told CNN the reason authorities are able to say the water is drinkable is because they perform tests only once it’s been flowing for several hours after an interruption. The ARS confirmed to CNN that tests are undertaken after water has been running for 12 hours following a cut. Mousdikoudine and Attoumani both said that after a cut, the water only starts to flow clear after it’s been running for hours. But most residents can’t forgo water during that time when it is rationed. As the water crisis continues, so do the health risks. The island has been experiencing anacute gastroenteritis epidemic, according to Dr. Soumeth Abasse, president of the medical committee of Mayotte’s Hospital. Gastroenteritis epidemics are not unusual in the summer months, Abasse said, but this one is extending well into the fall. “We’ve also had a worsening of cases,” he added. “Some cases were a little more difficult, more complicated, with a lot of cases ending up in intensive care.” He said the causes of the epidemic are both contaminated water and lowerhygiene standards resulting from people having less access to water, which affects their ability to wash their hands, shower, flush their toilets and clean their homes. “We’re always afraid of a possible explosion of these water-borne diseases,” Abasse said. “At any moment, things can get out of hand, and we don’t have enough staff to deal with it.” Mayotte’s understaffed hospital is only one of many infrastructural issues the French department is facing. Mayotte’s population hasnearly doubledsince 2007, and infrastructure improvements haven’t kept pace, Youssouffa said. Even outside periods of drought, water production on the territory is insufficient, according to the Prefecture, with water cuts a regular occurrence on the island, long before this year’s exceptionally low rainfall. The increased demands of a larger population coupled with the impacts of climate change, which is making droughts both more frequent and more severe, has put a huge amount of pressure on the island’s water resources. “The rains have been diminishing for years,” said Youssouffa. “We’ve seen the path of cyclones and the path of rains changing in the region … and that’s directly the impact of climate change.” For years, talks have been underway to build a third water reservoir anda second desalination plant to increase Mayotte’s drinking water production capabilities. But neither project has begun, according to the Prefecture. Mayotte has received funding to help with its dire water situation. In 2014, the European Commission allocated 22 million euros ($24 million) to Mayotte for its water supply, as part of a larger funding package. But in 2021, payments of the whole fund were suspended after an audit found “serious irregularities and shortcomings” in the management of the money, before resuming again this year. So far less than half of the money earmarked for water has been spent, the Prefecture told CNN. Mahorais continue to struggle with the financial repercussions of the dire water crisis. In July, the French government introduced aprice freezeon bottled water, but a pack of six 1.5 liter bottles can still cost as much as 12 euros ($13), according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. This makes it unaffordable for the majority of the island’s population. And that’s if bottled water is even available in the first place. Elsa Leduc, a humanitarian worker who moved to Mayotte from Paris in September, said trying to find bottled water has become a daily chore. “Every time I go to the supermarket, there’s no water,” she said. “I have to go to smaller shops that are a lot more expensive.” Leduc is lucky that she is able to afford the high prices, but most on the island can’t. According to INSEE,77%of Mayotte’s inhabitants live below the national poverty line, a figure that is five times higher than in the rest of France. “The difficulty with the water crisis is that it’s making Mayotte unlivable,” said Youssouffa. “The crisis is so bad that it’s interrupting public services. It’s interrupting schooling. It’s interrupting businesses. It’s not a normal life.” Mousdikoudine and Attoumani, like many Mahorais, wonder why authorities failed to prepare for it. “Since 2018, we’ve had small (water) cuts and we could see that there wasn’t any rain,” said Attoumani, “so they should have anticipated, found solutions.” “The whole system is falling apart literally before our eyes, because it’s shutting down,” said Youssouffa. “You cannot function without water.” All hopes are on the rainy season, which starts in December. But Mousdikoudine worries it won’t be enough. “I know things are going to get worse.”","        1:30 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
121,CNN,"Suzanne Shepherd, ‘Goodfellas’ and ‘Sopranos’ actor, dead at 89",Alli Rosenbloom,"Suzanne Shepherd, veteran actress known for playing the mother of Edie Falco’s Carmela Soprano on“The Sopranos,”has died. She was 89. A representative for Shepherd told CNN in a statement on Sunday that the actress had died at her home in New York City on Friday. A cause of death has not yet been determined, but Shepherd had been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to her representative. Shepherd’s decade-spanning career includes a number of iconic film and TV roles, including “The Sopranos,” “Goodfellas,” “Requiem for a Dream” and “Mystic Pizza.” Her first official Hollywood credit came in 1988 when she appeared as Aunt Tweedy in “Mystic Pizza” alongside Julia Roberts and Vincent D’onofrio. She went on to appear in movies such as “Working Girl” and “Uncle Buck” in the late 1980s. Her breakout role came in 1990 when she appeared as the mother of Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco) in “Goodfellas,” which starred Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. The film was nominated for six Oscars, with Pesci taking home a statue for his performance in a supporting role. Shepherd went on to appear in films such as “Lolita,” “Living Out Loud,” and “Trees Lounge” throughout the 1990s, before she took on her iconic role as Mary De Angelis in the Emmy-winning HBO series “The Sopranos.” ​​(HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery). She appeared in 20 episodes of the mob drama as the mother of Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco) between 2000 and 2007. “Sad to hear of the passing of Suzanne Shepherd,” her “Sopranos” co-star Ray Abruzzowroteon X (formerly Twitter) Sunday, adding that Shepherd was “a force of nature.” Her most recent credit, according to IMDb, came this year when she appeared with Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Piven and Maimie Mc Coy in the war-era film “The Performance.” Shepherd is survived by her daughter, Kate Shepherd, son-in-law Miles Mc Manus and granddaughter Isabelle Shepherd, according to her representative.","        4:36 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
122,CNN,Host India falters under nationwide pressure in Cricket World Cup final,Unknown,"Australia won a record-extending sixth men’s Cricket World Cupon Sunday, defying the odds and a partisan home crowd in Ahmedabad, to defeat host nation Indiaby six wickets. India fell just short of fulfilling its country’s expectations after it had dominated much of this tournament, cruising to 10 consecutive wins and ratcheting up the pressurein this cricket-obsessed nation that has waited 12 years for another one-day trophy. But its near impregnable batting line-up faltered in the face of Australia’s savvy bowling while Travis Head’s spectacular 137 off 120 balls anchored Australia’s run chase as it cantered towards victory and another World Cup trophy. The host nation had won the last three World Cups. With India occupying the No. 1 spot in the world rankings, it was widely expected that pattern would continue, particularly at the 132,000-seat Narendra Modi Stadium. India enjoyed a lightning fast start, scoring 80 runs in the first powerplay, equaling the record for a men’s World Cup final. Captain Rohit Sharma in particular produced metaphorical and literal fireworks that exploded above the stadium when he hit an enormous six into the stands. But Rohit fell shortly thereafter, out to a brilliant Head catch as Glenn Maxwell’s bowling induced a leading edge. Shreyas Iyer was out soon after that, stunning the Indian crowd and recalibrating the game. The run rate slowed as the pressure built, and Virat Kohli and KL Rahul sought to patiently rebuild India’s innings. But as soon as it seemed the pressure was waning when Rahul hit a boundary for the first time in 16 overs, Kohli was out for 54, chopping on to his stumps after a delivery from Australia captain Pat Cummins. Cummins rotated his bowlers frequently, preventing India’s batsmen from settling into a rhythm, and after Kohli’s dismissal, no partnership really formed to contribute a big score. Rahul battled to 66 off 107 balls, and the tail added some crucial runs to haul India to a respectable total but it always seemed like a difficult one to defend. All the momentum had shifted to Australia, and that initially carried into the batting. David Warner and Head put on 15 runs in the first over before Warner got out in the second over to Mohammed Shami, giving India a sliver of hope. Mitchell Marsh and Steve Smith fell shortly afterwards to leave Australia 47-3 and suddenly it was India with the momentum. Every play and miss provoked deafening cheers from the crowd, willing India to take another wicket and press home its advantage. But an outstanding Head, who was named player of the match, and Marnus Labuschagne, who scored 58, built a partnership that tore the game away from India. Head’s innings ended prematurely when he holed out two runs shy of victory leaving Maxwell to come on and hit the winning runs, prompting wild celebrations among the Australians.","        11:58 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
123,CNN,Opinion The vital mission to report on Sudan’s conflict,Nima Elbagir,"I have reported on conflicts around the world for over two decades, but nothing prepares you to cover a war at home. To see familiar places occupied and demolished. To fully plunge the depth of your helplessness. Yet my team and I set out to do just that this summer, working on a documentary about Sudan’s conflictand the hidden hands ultimately responsible for the atrocities that have come to define this war. Two separate voices fought for space in my head. One voice – the journalist – asked questions, took down notes and talked through testimony. I worked with my team to tackle the enormity of the logistical and editorial challenges that comes with filming an investigative documentary in a country ravaged by war. The second voice,which I tamped down while working, was closer to a babble, looping round and round in my head, reminding me that I could never truly run away from the fact that this was home, this was personal. “You, a people, whose spirit of revolution is ablaze” The music accompanying these words is sometimes joyful, sometimes somber, sometimes martial, interpreted as they have been by so many of Sudan’s musical maestros. To so many Sudanese, though, they are instantly recognisable as the words of the people’s poet: Mahjoub Sharif. “The depth of your sense of freedom will become a defining trait, running down the line of your descendants.” Even now, I hear his words and I’m instantly transported back to being five years old. To the first time I watched my mother cry in our London kitchen, as she copied tapes over on our double cassette deck, one reel playing out the songs as the other recorded. We’d then pass the original on to whoever was next in line in their small community of exiles. Sharif’s weren’t the only tapes that she and my father waited for impatiently. There were love songs from their youth, traditional tribal music for my village-boy father, and the latest songs taking over weddings and parties in Sudanese cities. It was the music of home, transporting them back to the country they’d loved so much that they’d been forced to leave it. I was warned to never, ever play with any of the tapes in the cassette deck, especially the tapes of Sharif’s songs. What I didn’t know at the time is that the tapes of his songs were contraband, smuggled out at risk of execution – his words deemed as dangerous as the protests they inspired. Nonetheless, I learned at an early age that words could get you killed. My mother’s and father’s words, as journalists, forced them into exile. My words – and my team’s work – investigating the RSF’s alliance with Russia got me indicted by pro-RSF authorities. For a year, it was too dangerous to go home. Yet, the moment the war broke out earlier this year, home was the only place I wanted to be. I am a child of exile because my parents aspired to practise journalism in a country where basic freedoms were withheld. In one of the interludes of stability between our bouncing around – Khartoum, Cairo, Jeddah and London – my parents set up a newspaper, initially in Sudan. That was during a lull between periods of military rule. Its publication later moved to Cairo, then back to Sudan in 2000, when my parents were persuaded to return home by a promise of democratization by then-dictator Omar al-Bashir. I am now past the age my mother was when we were in that kitchen in London. Over the past few years, I have been watching and reporting on the upheaval back home in Sudan, in the aftermath of the overthrow of Bashir. This has been the first time I’ve seen my country through my parents’ eyes. In 2019, I watched in awe as people flooded the streets and resisted gunfire to defy Bashir, and I watched in tears as the very soldiers Bashir had nurtured and elevated seized back control. What it’s brought home to me is that everything I am as a journalist stems from everything my parents are and still aspire to: the belief that we all – even those of us living far from Western capitals – deserve to dream of better. Everyone deserves a country that feels like it belongs to its people, not strongmen and soldiers. Everyone deserves the freedom to raise their voices. That is what has informed my work and the investigations we do. In April, when fighting broke out between Sudan’s army and the leadership of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, implicated in a previous genocide in Sudan’s western Darfur region, the team and I jumped straight in. We were broadcasting live. I was on air almost non-stop and in between those reports, I was messaging with my siblings around the world on how we would convince our parents to leave their home. Then the best news came. CNN’s US documentary strand “The Whole Story” wanted to commission an hour on Sudan. It was more than the team and I could have hoped for. We began to plan and I began to retreat into my place of experience and comfort, my journalist self. Who is behind this? Who is supporting and sustaining the fight? How do we get the world to care? The kind of questions we ask at the start of any investigation. Questions, though that hit a little differently because for me it was home. When the very act of seeking answers has implications for people you love, when the answers cast doubt on your family’s ability to ever return home again, the equation changes. For hours, the team and I workedunder the raffia mat roof of a traditional wooden structure near the Chad-Sudan border, setting up and rearranging ourselves as best we could, as interviewee after interviewee sat down in front of our cameras. There were almost two dozen in just one of the sittings. They were all bravely willing to record their testimony, what they had witnessed, what they had been forced to endure just across the border in Darfur. We arrived here after almost three weeks spent crossing through Sudan, and the months prior, investigating how Emirati backing, and Russia’s provision of support via its Wagner proxy militia and regional meddling, had enabled this war. This was also the moment when we finally got to hear from the victims themselves. I saton the ground listening to witness testimony, to young girls describing holding their younger brothers as the blood drained out of them, to litanies of rape, humiliation and enslavement, to descriptions of the depth and expanse of people’s loss. I found that I was furious. My journalist self was no longer a place I could hide. Even now back home in London, I find my rage is sometimes hard to contain. Again and again and again, I turn their stories over in my mind. I’ve never been ashamed of crying but for too long the tears wouldn’t come. Forty years after I watched my parents sing and cry and laugh to the Sudanese songs smuggled out to them, I find myself searching through Spotify for Sudanese playlists. I must not be the only one because almost every day I find new ones: love songs, pop songs about girls running barefoot to answer the door to aspiring suitors. Songs likening a beloved’s smile to a string of pearls, threaded to match the beauty mark on her cheek. Listening to those songs – the poetry of Sharif and Mohammed Mekki Ibrahim, the soaring vocals of Mohammed Wardi and Abdelgadir Salim – that is the only time I find myself able to cry. Those songs and what they meant for my parents, for the generations before them and the generations fighting for freedom today remind me that we, as a people, have been here before. That we overcame. That even now, surrounded by horror and bloodshed, so many Sudanese still believe in change. We still talk about democracy as a right. As an inevitability.","        4:39 AM EST, Mon November 20, 2023",20.0,11.0,2023.0
124,CNN,Civilians caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates between Myanmar military and armed group,Unknown,"Renewed hostilities between the Myanmar military and ethnic minority armed group the Arakan Army (AA) have spread to various townships in western Myanmar, including Pauktaw, where civilians have been caught in the crossfire as fighting escalates. A former member of parliament from Pauktaw township, who asked not to be identified due to safety concerns, told CNN on Saturday that he had lost contact with people from the town and did not know what is happening. “I left the town the day the fighting broke out. But there are elderly people, sick people and families with young children left as they could not make haste,” he said. “It’s raining and a storm is coming too. It’s a devastating situation. It breaks my heart to see people in such a situation.” Ongoing clashes between the Arakan Army and the military began in the Rathedaung township on November 13 and have since spread to the townships of Maungdaw, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Pauktaw, Ponnagyun, and Paletwa, according to a statement from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) on Friday. Therenewed fightinghas displaced more than 26,000 people in the country’s western Rakhine state since Monday, according to UNOCHA. The two parties had previously established an informal ceasefire in November 2022, according to the UN, but fighting broke out after the Arakan Army reportedly attacked two border posts. In astatementreleased on Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said the latest figures brought the total number of internally displaced people due to the conflict between the two sides to approximately 90,000. It added that there had been reports of military shelling in Arakan Army-controlled areas. Myanmar’s military had also conducted at least one operation backed by air and naval support, UNOCHA said. Myanmar military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said during a briefing Friday that the Myanmar army and police force had retaken the Pauktaw police station and that the town “was already under control” of the military. Most humanitarian activities have been suspended due to the resurgence of the conflict and “virtually all roads and waterways” between townships in Rakhine have been blocked, according to OCHA. Battles between the military and resistance groups have unfolded almost daily across Myanmar since army general Min Aung Hlaing seized power in February 2021, plunging the country into economic chaos and fresh civil war. Airstrikes and ground attacks on what the Myanmar military calls “terrorist” targets have been occurred regularly since 2021 and have killed thousands of civilians to date, including children, according tomonitoring groups. Whole villages have been burned down by junta soldiers and schools, clinics and hospitals destroyed. The son of a man from Pauktow who was killed as a result of the latest hostilities, told CNN that his father had been “hit by pieces of artillery at a meditation center” after Myanmar’s State Administration Council (SAC) soldiers started shooting at him “constantly.” “I was told he was crying out of pain, I can’t imagine how he would be suffering in a pool of blood. The next morning, I got a call that he passed away at night,” the man said. U Nan Diya, Chaung Suak village’s abbot monk, told CNN that he had been assisting three fellow villagers – a father sick with heart disease, accompanied by his daughter and son-in-law. Despite the family reaching a hospital two days before hostilities resumed, they remained stranded in a house in Pauktaw after the town “turned into a war zone,” U Nan Diya said. The sick man’s daughter had attempted to look for a boat to return to their village but was arrested by soldiers on Friday, he added. U Nan Diya said the 60-year-old man with heart disease was getting worse without medication. “(His) family wants him at their home instead of letting him die at a stranger’s house but nobody can go out or use the water route because the military navy is stationed in the sea, shooting everyone they see,” he said. “The sick man can’t die peacefully.”","        11:19 PM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
125,CNN,De Santis refuses to condemn Musk for endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theory,Unknown,"Republican presidential candidate Ron De Santis on Sunday refused to directly condemn Elon Musk for publiclyendorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theorypopular among White supremacists. The Florida governor first told CNN’s Jake Tapper he did not see the comment, which Musk responded to on X Wednesday, but said Musk has had a “target on his back” ever since purchasing the platform. The Xpost, which Tapper showed De Santis, said: “Jewish communties (sic) have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” The post also referenced “hordes of minorities” flooding Western countries, a popular antisemitic conspiracy theory. In response, Musk said: “You have said the actual truth.” The antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews want to bring undocumented minority populations into Western countries to reduce White majorities in those nations has been espoused by online hate groups and echoed by Robert Bowers, the convicted killer of 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. It was the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. Tapper asked if antisemitism among the political right concerns De Santis, to which De Santis responded, “across the board.” The Anti-Defamation Leaguesaid last monththat antisemitic incidents in the US increased 388% in the weeks following the Hamas attack in Israel on Oct. 7,according to preliminary data. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has also seen an uptick in reports following the attack, but it did not have numbers to release. After Tapper pushed back on the characterization of “fringe,” considering Musk and other political figures on the right who have shared White supremacist tropes have large platforms, De Santis stood by his position and continued to reference universities, rather than Musk. “You’ve seen this become part of a left-wing movement, a very significant pro-Hamas movement. And it is backed by institutional power,” he said. Pressed by Tapper again on Musk’s tweet, De Santis maintained: “I have no idea what the context is.” “I know Elon Musk, I’ve never seen him do anything. I think he’s a guy that believes in America. I’ve never seen him indulge in any of that. So it is surprising if that’s true. But I have not seen it. So I don’t sit there and pass judgment on the fly,” he said.

126,CNN,Opinion An 11-year-old who survived Uvalde says he and his friends will ‘never be the same’,Unknown,"On May 24, 2022, then-fourth-grader Daniel Ruiz managed to escapethe Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texasthat claimed the lives of19 of his classmates and two teachers.  Daniel climbed out of classroom 109 to safety through broken glass. But Daniel, now 11, says the fun-loving kid he was, prior to that fateful day, did not survive the massacre. He doesn’t know anyone who is the same person after that experience. “Sometimes, when my anxiety makes me zone out, I wish that I would just be back in the fourth grade and wake up and this would just be a bad, bad dream,” Daniel told me. “My friends, cousins and I will never be the same again … I miss how happy I used to be. I hate how I can’t stop my head from spinning or thinking of things that can go bad.” Gun violence is theleading cause of deathfor children living in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), andaround 132 people succumb to gun-related injuries each day.Yet these harrowing statistics do not fully or adequately encapsulate the true, ever-lasting harm caused by acts of gun violence. The children left behind — kids with mental, physical and emotional scars, like Daniel — lose a piece of their former selves, too. And even when they have access to quality mental, physical and emotional support, they face numerous uphill battles that impact their quality of life. Sometimes, forever. According to a recent study published inthe journal Health Affairs,in the one-year period after a shooting, survivors’ health care costs increased by about $34,884, or a 17.1-fold increase. The study, which only evaluated children who had associated health insurance claims, does not include those who do not have access to health insurance or who cannot afford any out-of-pocket costs for physical, mental and emotional care. From the needs of children who were injured to those for whom the scars of gun violence are not visible, simply having access to health care coverage in the US—already inaccessible to far too many— does not guarantee that a child will fully recover from an act of gun violence. “I’m a single parent doing it on my own, so any appointments he has or even my other children have, means I have to miss work and it makes it so hard,” Briana Ruiz, Daniel’s mom, told me. “It cost me so much and got to the point where I was afraid I was going to lose (our) home … When Daniel has bad days, I can’t always afford to keep him home and make sure he’s OK mentally, because if I do, I’ll fall behind on my bills and I can’t let that happen.” Dr. Chethan Sathya, a pediatric trauma surgeon and director of the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at Northwell Health, told me that if US legislators lack the political will to pass common sense gun legislation that curbs the epidemic of gun violence, health care supports for children needs to change in order to adequately meet an increase in pediatric gun violence patients. “So few resources have been poured into this issue,” Sathya told me. “A lot of the services we’re talking about are beyond surgical care… If someone comes in with a gunshot wound, our trauma team is activated and we care for them surgically.” Her team is not resourced to provide ongoing care for disability, PTSD, substance use or other behavior health issues that may present in the aftermath of a shooting. As a result, Sathya says that when he has a patient with a gun injury and they survive, he does not know if that patient is “going to have everything they need for rehabilitation.” “How am I going to know that they have adequate follow-up and social work and case management?” he asks. “A lot of patients who aren’t even able to come in for follow-up care for their wounds get secondary infections — complications that are totally preventable just from the surgeries that we do to repair the wounds.” In addition,pediatric gunshot victims are often cared for by a burnt out and overworked hospital care system, where doctors, nurses and support staff are facing their own mental health issues, staffing shortages and inadequate workplace environments. “There is intense trauma among healthcare workers themselves, normalizing — unfortunately — the fact that kids do come in with bullet wounds,” Sathya says. “(Gun violence) affects everybody.” It is also impactinga crippling mental health care systemthat is already facing staffing issues, particularlyamong clinicians of colorand at a time when Black children are five times more likely to be a victim of gun violence than their White peers, according to data from PEW Research Center. “We need people to have more access to not only training programs but creating good training programs. We need to have more diversity and training of diverse groups of people providing (mental health) services,” Dr. Jill Emanuel, vice president of clinical training for the Child Mind Institute, told me. In addition to a larger and more diverse clinician population, Emanuel says society at large needs to focus more on the mental and emotional needs of young people who manage to escape an act of gun violence with their life. “Our job as adults and as caretakers of children is to provide as much support for them as possible and to restore their sense of psychological safety.” She notes that people may assume a child is fine if they have access to therapy, but their caretakers also need to be having ongoing conversations with them. How clinicians are licensed, she adds, can also make a difference. “Right now, we are all licensed in our individual states and there are some initiatives to figure out licensing across state lines,” Emanuel says, noting that making telehealth more accessible and allowing for more reimbursement for health insurances will also eradicate some of the many barriers to long-term care for pediatric gun violence survivors. For Briana Ruiz, she simply wishes more people understood that just because a child wasn’t struck with a bullet doesn’t mean they’re “perfectly fine and (can) get on with their lives.” Perhaps then, she hopes, with some societal understanding, her son can start to become the boy he used to be. “Nobody sees all the anger and uncertainty that these children have to live with for the rest of their lives now … Their worlds were turned completely upside down in a matter of seconds … My son to this day says he can still hear the bullets bouncing off things in his class,” Briana Ruiz says. “He recalls the noise the bullet made when striking a classmate and hearing her and his teacher in pain from being shot. These are the things that are not just going to go away.”","        2:37 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
127,CNN,France makes history with 14-0 Euro 2024 qualifier win,Unknown,"It was a night that will live long in the memory for Francefans as Les Bleusthrashed 10-man Gibraltar by an astonishing 14-0 in their European Championship qualifying match, with Kylian Mbappéscoring a hat trick. This was the world’s No. 2-ranked team playing against a country ranked 198 in the world and the gulf between the two was evident on the pitch. It was the biggest winning margin in the history of the qualifiers, surpassing Germany’s 13-0 thumping of San Marino in 2006, and marked the first time a European team had scored 14 goals in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match, according to Reuters. Mbappé’s long-range effort to complete his hat trick was the pick of France’s goals in the Allianz Riviera, Nice, on a night where seven goals were scored in each half. Warren Zaïre-Emery, aged 17 years, eight months and 11 days, also made history as he became France’s youngest player since 1914 and marked his debut with a first-half goal. The night started badly for Gibraltar when Ethan Santos put the ball into his own net after just three minutes and from there on things unraveled for the visitors as Santos was shown a red card in the 18th minute for a foul on Zaïre-Emery, which ended the teenager’s participation. Marcus Thuram, Jonathan Clauss, Youssouf Fofana, Adrien Rabiot, Ousmane Dembélé all scored for France, while Olivier Giroud and Kingsley Coman got two goals apiece. “Being down to 10, already with 11 it’s complicated for them, but it doesn’t take away the credit for us even if we could have been more efficient, it’s as much about respecting the opponent as scoring goals,” France manager Didier Deschamps said, per Reuters. “Fourteen is not bad.” France had 39 attempts on goal, 19 of which were on target, while Gibraltar failed to muster a chance. France, already qualified for Euro 2024 in Germany, is top of Group B while a winless Gibraltar is bottom on zero points without having yet scored a goal during qualification.","        9:41 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0

Anntonia Porsild of Thailand placed as first runner-up. Palacios’ win marks the first-ever time a Nicaraguan woman has won Miss Universe. She had previously represented Nicaragua in the 2017 Teen Miss Universe pageant, placing in the top 10, and in the 2021 Miss World pageant. The winners of 84 countries’ national pageants had competed at this year’s Miss Universe, judged by a panel including model Halima Aden, “Queer Eye” star Carson Kressley, Tik Tok influencer Avani Gregg and two former Miss Universe winners, Janelle Commissiong of Trinidad & Tobago (Miss Universe 1977) and Iris Mittenaere of France (Miss Universe 2016). Twenty semi-finalists were announced at the beginning of Saturday night’s proceedings following the results of the preliminary competition (and a global fan vote). After the swimsuit round, the field was narrowed to 10 — seeing the elimination ofthe first “curvy” contestantto make the pageant’s semi finals, Miss Nepal, as well as the first contestant to choose a burkini as their swimsuit, Miss Pakistan. The evening gown round cut the number of contestants in half again. Two rounds of hot topic Q&As then left just three women in contention: Palacios, Porsild and second runner-up Moraya Wilson of Australia. Asked in the final round who she would choose to spend a day in the life of, Palacios chose the 18th-century British philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who she said broke boundaries and “gave an opportunity to many women.” “There are no limitations for women today,” she added, via a translator. Miss Colombia, Camila Avella, and Miss Puerto Rico, Karla Guilfú, rounded out the top five, while another member of the top 10, Spain’s Athenea Pérez, was crowned the pageant’s Miss Congeniality.

129,CNN,Auguste Toulmouche/From Wikipedia,Scottie Andrew,"Behold, a woman fuming. Though she’s dressed in an opulent, fur-trimmed gown in a palatial French home sometime in the mid-19th century, her silent fury is recognizable to women the world over who’ve contained their ire to an eye roll. She’s “The Hesitant Fiancée,” the eponymous subject of the painter Auguste Toulmouche’s 1866 painting. The realist work, which had been overshadowed in art history by the arrival of French Impressionist painters soon after, is being reappraised more than 150 years later byart buffson Tik Tok. She’s inspired scores ofinterpretationsfrom users who imagine the undoubtedly irritated thoughts going through her mind when she was painted — “you’d look so much prettier with a smile on your face”— becoming something of ameme template. She’s appreciated by women who share her disillusionment with confining gender roles. And she’s inviting feminist reassessments of the painting itself. When “The Hesitant Fiancée” was first exhibited, works depicting the quiet indignation of women were sometimes seen as unserious, and much of the popular art at the time satirized single women, said Kathryn Brown, associate professor of art history and visual culture at Loughborough University in the UK. But seen through contemporary eyes, “The Hesitant Fiancée” shows women in solidarity, supporting each other in “negotiating oppressive systems,” noted Brown, who wrote about Toulmouche’s work in the monograph “Women Readers in French Painting 1870–1890.” “Over a century and a half later, perhaps we’re still discovering the full political significance of that kind of unity,” she said in an email. Toulmouche painted scenes of elegant, wealthy French women in domestic settings, often chronicling their romantic exploits. The women in his paintings were, on the surface, little more than sumptuously dressed debutantes — the French novelist Émile Zola in 1874 called Toulmouche’s subjects “delicious dolls,” Brown said. Toulmouche’s paintings were successful in their day partly because of the “fantasy of female life” they depicted: The women in his works are wives, mothers, sisters and daughters who don’t stray from their roles in the domestic sphere, Brown said. “The Hesitant Fiancée,” also translated to “The Reluctant Bride,” was originally exhibited under the title “Un mariage de raison,” or “A Marriage of Convenience” at the Académie des Beaux-Arts’ Paris Salon in 1866, Brown said. Toulmouche’s work was popular for a time, with his paintings often recreated as etchings in newspapers, Brown noted. But he was eventually overshadowed by Impressionist painters like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas, she said. While Toulmouche was “by no means a painter of feminist art,” Brown said, the women in his paintings are interpreted today as slyly subversive. In the 1865 painting“Forbidden Fruit,”three young women excitedly pore over books in a library while a fourth appears to guard the door. They’ve snuck into this room searching for information — “undoubtedly about sex,” Brown added, based on their wry smiles — that’s been kept from them. Brown suggests that the four women in “Forbidden Fruit” reappear in “The Hesitant Fiancée,” now supporting one of their own in her unhappy slog toward the altar. “One of the four young women from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ is now about to be married, perhaps to the ‘wrong’ person or because she doesn’t want to marry at all,” Brown said. “Read as a narrative that unfolds across the two works, it looks like the young woman from ‘Forbidden Fruit’ knows what’s about to happen to her.” The revival of “The Hesitant Fiancée” has been centuries in the making. Popular art accounts on Tik Tok started posting about it over the last few weeks, discovering it with glee, though at least one user, art enthusiast Kira (@The Art Revival),shareda video about Toulmouche in February. She said in an email that she’s long loved his work. “One of my favorite subjects in art is fancy ladies lounging around, living life with apathy,” she said. “Few can relate to their lives but nearly all can relate to their disdain.” The popular user Tatyana About Art said that “The Hesitant Fiancée” is really a tragedy. The subject of the painting is likely depicted moments away from — or moments after — marrying the husband she’s less than in love with. She’s flanked by two women who gently attempt to comfort her while another plays with a flower crown in the mirror, perhaps dreaming of her own wedding day. “The bride is completely alone in her sentiment of doom and unwillingness,” art historian Tatyanasaidin a video about “The Hesitant Fiancée.” Today, though, some Tik Tok-ers view the titular fiancée as a rebel, not entering quietly into a marriage she’s unhappy about. Some users havetheorizedthat she may not have been attracted to men at all, and since homosexuality was still viewed as immoral in 19th-century France, living openly would’ve been near-impossible at the time. While we may never know the full story of the woman skulking in the armchair, her fed-up mien is familiar to anyone who’s ever had to swallow their anger. She’s trapped, said Kira, and “we’ve all been there.” That she’s expressing it within the confines of her rigid societal role is still captivating over a century later. “I see her and think, ‘Yes babe, roll those eyes,’” Kira said.","        4:00 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
130,CNN,Mike Blake/Reuters,Unknown,"After spending much of the build-up to the Las Vegas Grand Prixmaking it clear he wasunenthusedby the event, Max Verstappen decided it was time for a little less conversation and a little more action on Saturday as he did what he does best – winning Formula One races. The Red Bull driver, wearing a race suit inspired by Elvis Presley,sang the King of Rock and Roll’s famous “Viva Las Vegas” song as crossed the chequered flag first, giving the impression that, in the end, he couldn’t help but fall in love with Sin City after a thrilling night race under the bright lights. Plenty had been written about the Grand Prix, the first in Vegas since the 1980s, and not all of it was good, with the first practice session cancelled due to a loose drain cover and Verstappen making headlines for describing the event as “99% show, 1% sport.” But once the lights went green, the race delivered, with three-time world champion Verstappen securing a record-extending 18th win of the season and his Red Bull team achieving a single-season record 20th race win. Verstappen also became the first man to win three races in the same country in a season, having already won in Austin and Miami, and is now third on the all-time list for career wins, level with Sebastian Vettel and behind only Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton. Unlike in many of the season’s previous races, however, Verstappen did not cruise to victory. Starting second on the grid, it wasn’t until lap 37 that the Dutchman passed Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc to take the race lead. A five-second penalty for the Dutchman for pushing Leclerc off the track at the start of the race curtailed the Red Bull driver initially before he took control towards the end of the race – surviving a damaged front wing after a late clash with George Russell and numerous safety cars. Verstappen said afterwards that the race was “definitely a lot of fun.” “It was a tough one. I tried to go for it at the start,” he told reporters of his attempt to pass Leclerc at Turn 1. “I think we both braked quite late, then I just ran out of grip and we ended up a bit wide, so the stewards gave me a penalty for that.” Leclerc finished second, his fifth podium finish of the season, after impressively overtaking Sergio Perez on the final lap to deny Red Bull a one-two finish. Perez, however, did secure second place in the drivers’ championship to ensure Red Bull will end the season with a one-two in the drivers’ championship for the first time. It was another disappointing performance for Mercedes with Hamilton in seventh and Russell eighth, the latter causing a safety car appearance and incurring a five-second penalty for clashing with Verstappen. As expected, there were plenty of celebrities in attendance, from former England soccer captain David Beckham to Hollywood actor Brad Pitt. And pop star Justin Bieber waved the chequered flag, adding more razzmatazz to a weekend that was already filled with glitz. “A great crowd. I hope everyone enjoyed it.  We definitely did,” said the Verstappen, per F1. “I’m already excited to come back here next year and hopefully try to do something similar.”","        6:08 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
131,CNN,Christopher Hopefitch/Digital Vision/Getty Images,Unknown,"Editor’s note:Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. If you’re struggling to start or maintain a regular exercise regimen, the answer may be sitting faithfully at your feet. Walking your dog is a fantastic way to get in shape, and it benefits both you and your pooch. Some69 million US householdsare home to at least one dog. Yet many dog owners never take their pets on a walk, or do so infrequently. Additionally, while 61% of dog owners walked their pup at least 10 minutes at a time, according to a 2011 survey in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health, only 27% walked their dog 150 minutes per week — the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’srecommendation for adults’ weekly, moderate-intensity physical activity. If you’re among those who are not that physically active, use your pooch as inspiration to head outside and start moving. “If you can keep your dog happy and healthy at the same time that you’re keeping yourself healthy and bettering the dog-man bond, that’s great,” said Dr. Jerry Klein, chief veterinary officer with the American Kennel Club. Canine obesity is the No. 1 preventive health problem in American dogs, Klein added. Various studies indicate those who walk their dogs are more than 2.5 times as likely to achieve moderate-intensity physical activity, according to a2015 journal article. That’s one reason the American Kennel Club created the AKC Fit Dog program. Any dog owner who walks their pet at least 30 minutes five times per week for at least three months receives a free magnet. You’re also eligible if you walk your dog at least 15 minutes 10 times per week for a minimum of three months. As with humans, regular walks are crucial for a dog’s mental and physical health. “Getting your dog out in nature, getting fresh air and sunlight, is just as beneficial for dogs as for people,” said Dr. Victoria Tomasino, owner and medical director at Good Vets Boynton Beach and Good Vets Delray in Palm Beach County, Florida. “It awakens the senses in both parties.” This combination of mental and physical stimulation can also help quash problematic canine behaviors. “Most dogs are bored to death,” said Dawn Celapino, founder of Leash Your Fitness, a San Diego-based business where clients and their dogs work out together. “They need mental stimulation and bonding with their owner, but a lot of people don’t realize that.” Before grabbing a leash, keep some things in mind, Klein said. Your dog should know basic commands such as sit, stay and come. Make sure to slowly increase your walking time and mileage, as dogs need to acclimate to new levels of exercise just as humans do. Flat-faced breeds such as pugs have breathing issues and can’t do a lot of high-intensity or lengthy workouts, while a vet should sign off on any new activity for older dogs. All breeds can struggle with excessive heat or cold, too, so always check the weather. “You also have to be able to read your dog,” Klein said. “If your dog isn’t cooperating or doesn’t seem interested in a walk, try to find something different.” Tomasino agreed that not all dogs enjoy walks. “You see quite often that dogs who are supposed to be high-energy prefer to be couch potatoes,” she said. “It comes down to personality, and you have to respect that.” Thankfully, there are plenty of other ways to be active with your pooch. You can hike, swim, bike, in-line skate , play Frisbee or do circuit training with your dog. There are herding and retrieving events, both organized and competitive, that mimic the activities certain dogs were bred to do. You can harness yourself to a larger-breed dog and cross-country ski together, a sport known as skijoring, or try canicross. Also known as urban mushing, it involves attaching yourself to your dog via a waist harness and bungee leash, then going for a run. READ MORE:Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts. No matter the exercise, be mindful of your pet’s health and safety. Biking, for example, is much easier for the human who is peddling than the dog that’s running. “I see people riding bikes with a dog, and the dog is gasping for breath and limping,” Tomasino said. “But the person is so focused on biking, they’re not paying attention to their dog.” She also nixed using retractable leashes during higher-speed activities such as in-line skating. “With retractable leashes, you have no control over that dog,” Tomasino said. “If another dog is coming at you, for example, that’s dangerous for you and the dog. You need them close to you so you can correct and change course if need be.” Remember to be patient when your dog is learning a new activity, too. “Start slow,” Celapino said. “They might not understand what you want them to do, and they need to work up to things. But don’t discount your dog. Dogs can do a lot of things.” Celapino cited her canine-human fitness classes as an example. During a recent session at a local park, dogs had to sit while their human was performing an exercise, then both ran a lap around the park. “We’re constantly moving, then stopping in my classes, which makes your dog have to think about everything they do,” she said. “That’s what tires them out.” No matter the activity you land on, always tune into your pet. “Exercising is really good bonding for you and your dog, as long as you stay off your phone,” Celapino said. Klein agreed. “What dogs enjoy most is spending time with their people,” he said.","        1:43 PM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
132,CNN,Charlie Riedel/AP,Unknown,"It’s already a vital American truth that Dolly Partonis a national treasure, and has been for decades. When the accolade of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was heaped onto the septuagenarian singer-songwriter-actress-theme park owner and entrepreneur last year, a curious thing happened:Parton said no thank you, as politely as you’d imagine she would, because she didn’t think of herself as a luminary in the world of rock ‘n’ roll. From there, Parton saw a challenge to become a rockstar in her own right, and afterher husband suggested she do a rock album, she embarked on the journey, culminating with Friday’s release of her appropriately titled forty-ninth (!!) solo studio album, “Rockstar.” The record is an event, clocking in at over 140 minutes with 30 tracks, plus three bonus songs on the limited edition CD. It calls to mind a not-too-long-ago era when albums were cohesive pieces of content (remember the concept of a “concept album”?). “Rockstar” starts out gamely enough, with the original opening title track featuring Richie Sambora and including some spoken vocals that clue the listener in to the idea this is a rock album Parton wanted to make since she was a young thing. The second track is also an original song, “World on Fire,” which dutifully tries to ruffle some feathers (like a rockstar would) by commenting on the state of the world today. From there, the album dips heavily into some covers, and because Parton is who she is, it has the distinction of attracting an insane number of collaborators, many coming back to perform their most recognizable song, something most of them would probably not rehash if it weren’t for the chance to rehash with Dolly herself. The results are a mixed bag. “Magic Man (Carl Version)” with Ann Wilson of Heart sounds incredible, while the less energetic “Long As I Can See the Light” with John Fogerty feels somewhat unnecessary. Other missteps include working with Kid Rockon an original track, as well as an equally unnecessary update of Queen’s “We Are the Champions/We Will Rock You.” But it can all be forgiven by some of the “Rockstar’s” shiniest baubles, like Parton’s transcendent rendition of Prince’s “Purple Rain,” a version that feels respectful and pared down in a way that showcases her still-steely vocals. The thought occurred to me that I hadn’t heard a cover of “Purple Rain” … perhaps ever, because who would dare attempt such a thing since Prince left us? Dolly would, and it’s a good thing she did. Another shining moment is Parton’s duet with her goddaughter Miley Cyrus for a gorgeous rework of the latter’s 2013 hit “Wrecking Ball” we didn’t know we needed. To say Dolly lets her hair down on “Rockstar” would be an understatement, with fun moments including original team-ups with Stevie Nicks, Melissa Etheridge and Ronnie Mc Dowell – the latter for a spirited tribute to Elvis Presley – in which their banter back and forth is just as engaging as the actual singing. Her cover of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by The Rolling Stones benefits from some new blood, brought by Pink and Brandi Carlile, while the immediate recognizability of songs like “Baby I Love Your Way” by Peter Frampton and “Keep on Loving You” by Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon make the album almost feel like a piece of sterling karaoke – and why should it be considered a bad thing?? (And yes, Frampton and Cronin come back for their respective ballads with Parton.) Some song selections, like Elton John’s “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me,” resuscitate the age-old conversation of what actually defines a rock ‘n’ roll song, but the experiment pays off thanks to Parton’s commitment. Then there’s the nearly 8-minute-long take on “Stairway to Heaven,” featuring none other than Lizzo on her flute, which has its own name, Sasha Flute. It’s a combination of elements leading to something magical, even with the marked absence of the surviving members of Led Zeppelin. All in all, it’s clear this was a labor of love for Parton, as heard evidently enough on tracks such as her revisit of 4 Non Blondes’ “What’s Up?” featuring Linda Perry and “Heartbreaker” with Pat Benatar and Neil Geraldo. While the immediate effect of listening to covers like these may elicit a smirk – like, really? She chose that one?! – Parton’s trademark ever-earnest nature comes through on the record in a way that is entirely hers, even with a staggering 21 cover songs in the tracklist.","        10:01 PM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
133,CNN,Peter Frank Edwards for High Wire Distilling Co,Unknown,"Hurricane Florence was targeting Campbell Coxe’s farm. Days earlier, the 2018 storm had rapidly intensified in the Atlantic, and now Darlington County, South Carolina, was in the path. Coxe had to make a quick decision: Which of his family’s crops was he going to save? “When you only have 24 hours, you pick the most valuable one,” recalled Coxe. He chose the Jimmy Red corn, an heirloom crop that generations of moonshiners knew for its nutty sweet flavor and high oil content. But scientists also know it as one of a few plants that could help society grow food amid the climate crisis, as temperatures get hotter, fresh water becomes scarce and storms get stronger. In what would normally take a week to accomplish, Coxe frantically harvested, through daylight and darkness, his 50 acres of Jimmy Red just before the storm hit and destroyed the remaining crops. What he saved he delivered to his only Jimmy Red customer two hours down the road in Charleston. “Not only was I counting on it, but High Wire Distilling was absolutely counting on it,” explained Coxe. “(Florence) sobered us up and scared us into thinking, ‘Hey, this is too much for one man and we need to kind of spread (Jimmy Red corn) out.’” It wasn’t Jimmy Red’s first brush with catastrophe. In September 2008, nearly two decades before Florence hit Coxe’s farm, Ted Chewning stood in a Colleton County shop holding two ears of the blood-red corn. “I was fascinated by it,” said Chewning, a farmer and heirloom seed collector. “It was a beautiful corn on the cob.” They were the last two ears of Jimmy Red. A local moonshiner – and the last known grower of Jimmy Red corn – had just died, and the family no longer wanted to grow corn for whiskey distilling. They gave the ears to the shop owner, who figured Chewning could do something with them. “I held onto it through the winter, saved one ear, and planted the seeds from the second in the spring,” said Chewning. Years later, scientists realized Chewning likely saved Jimmy Red from extinction and with it, a genetic code that may help commercial corn growers combat a rapidly changing climate. It’s not just the climate that’s changing – global population is soaring, hitting 8 billion late last year and predicted to peak over 10 billion in the 2080s. The world is going to have to grow more food on half the land with half the resources, said Brian Ward, a research scientist at Clemson University. “The genes in heirloom corn can help us do that,” he said. Jimmy Red dwindled because it’s not the kind of corn that is edible straight off the cob. It has to be dehydrated to extract its flavor and high oil content – ideal for making moonshine, but not valuable for large commercial farming. Its value is in its genetics. Heirloom grains, vegetables and fruits have developed traits that make them less vulnerable to climate change, Ward said, because they have been grown over hundreds of years in wildly different conditions. Those traits can be used to breed cultivars that will withstand harsher growing environments. “An heirloom may have that gene that can produce well in extreme conditions,” explained Ward. “We have a geneticist that’s breeding out an heirloom snap bean. It may not be the best-looking pod or have the highest yield, but it can produce in the heat and we’ll ultimately breed it into a variety that’s higher yielding.” Ward has been growing Jimmy Red corn for a little more than a decade to better understand its viability and biosecurity, or how well it withstands disease. It can be grown with less water, Ward said, and requires less fertilization. Its root system is incredibly stable, making the plant less susceptible to falling over in storms – something Ward believes it developed from years of enduring strong coastal storms while growing on James Island, South Carolina. “If the only plants that stay standing and bear fruit are the ones that (farmers) saved seed from, generations later, you have a plant with characteristics that withstand high winds,” Ward said. Knowing the genetic trait of Jimmy Red corn, Ward said, scientists can now breed that genetic code into other commercially grown corn varieties that have been susceptible to high winds. Ward also pointed to his research on another heirloom grain, Carolina Gold Rice, as an example of using genetic breeding to combat high salinity water in South Carolina and the Mississippi River Delta, where most of the rice in the US is grown and where extreme drought has pushed saltwater upstream from the Gulf of Mexico. “Japanese scientists found some genetic markers that code salt tolerance,” said Ward. “Carolina Gold has some salt tolerance. But we’re breeding it now to maintain the characteristics of Carolina Gold but have the addition of higher tolerance. We’re building on their research.” This September, Coxe harvested his 50 acres of Jimmy Red at his normal pace. He’s no longer the lone grower for High Wire Distilling, which turned about 1.1 million pounds of the red corn into a whiskey co-founders Ann Marshall and Scott Blackwell call extremely complex, with those familiar nutty, sweet flavors. “I call it reverse pioneering,” said Marshall. “This grain is tens of thousands of years old. It’s survived a lot and done so without human input. We’re returning back to the old ways, and there’s a lot to learn from.” High Wire has sent kernels to farms around the region to lower the odds that one natural disaster, like a hurricane, will wipe out the entirety of Jimmy Red. Ward believes having a company like High Wire driving demand for heirlooms will ensure scientists can study the past for answers to an uncertain climate future. “If we lose that genetic material, we can’t replace it,” he said.","        2:00 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
134,CNN,Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times/Redux,Unknown,"You would be forgiven for referring to the 2023 NBA rookie cohort as the “Victor Wembanyama draft class.” After all, the 7-foot-4-inchesteenageris the most hyped prospect since Le Bron James. He is a walking cheat code who is unlike anything basketball has ever seen before, with 2014 MVP Kevin Durant among those alreadysinging the Frenchman’s praisesthis season. However, “Wembymania” is not the only unprecedented narrative from thisdraft. Amen and Ausar Thompson have their own story to tell. Though multiple pairs of twins have played together in the NBA, the Thompson brothers became the first siblings to be drafted in the top five of the same draft. They were even drafted back-to-back. Amen was selected fourth overall by the Houston Rockets, while Ausar came off the board at No. 5 to the Detroit Pistons. “We really haven’t seen a pair of brothers like this in a long time, maybe ever in the NBA,”Kelly Iko, an NBA and Houston Rockets writer for The Athletic, told CNN Sport. “It just seems like everything they do translates to winning basketball. Crashing the glass, if it’s helping on defense, rotating, communication, ball movement, facilitation, just trying to find guys and get to great spots.” The twins had an unorthodox path to the league. After deciding to forgo their last year of high school and renounce their college eligibility, they signed with Overtime Elite (OTE), a startup basketball league for 16 to 20-year-olds based in Atlanta. They spent two seasons in OTE, playing on separate teams in their first year before Amen joined his brother on the City Reapers, where they were coached by Dave Leitao. He describes the twins as having “insatiable” work ethics and says they are “very humble, tremendous people.” “This is my 40th year in basketball, so I think I’ve been around some pretty special individuals,” Leitao said to CNN Sport. “Amen and Ausar, two or three times a week, would do something that I’ve never seen before. “I’ve been caught on camera saying: ‘I’ve never seen that before, like, did you just see what I saw?!’” Amen and Ausar were born on January 30, 2003, in Oakland, California, with Amen being the older twin by a solitary minute. They share the middle name XLNC (pronounced “excellence”), which was given to them to convey a sense of power and greatness, according to their father Troy, who is also their agent. The brothers have often spoken about how inseparable they are, and told the New York Times earlier this year that they had never spent more than two days apart. Making it to the NBA had always been a shared dream – the twins created avision boardwhen they were nine years old, with one of the central goals being to “become the greatest NBA player of all time.” They played high school basketball together at Pine Crest School after moving to Florida and were both five-star recruits after graduating. They were still very much a duo at OTE (even though they played on different teams during their first year) and are each other’s biggest fan. However, life in the league means that they now often find themselves on opposite sides of the country, something that the twins made sure to prepare for. “They were adamant about understanding that they were going to have to separate,” Leitao said. “Now that they’re apart, they talk every day.” The college path has long been the traditional way of making it to the league for American basketball players. Nationally televised games, the allure of the NCAA tournament and a plethora of NBA scouts watching you are all part of the appeal. However, in recent years, we have seen aspiring hoopers choose alternative routes, such as overseas competitions and the developmental G League, to the NBA. It is not that the Dukes, UCLAs and North Carolinas of the world are losing their shine – March Madness will always be March Madness – more so that the next generation is increasingly exploring opportunities off the beaten track. Overtime Elite was launched in 2021 as another option for young players. It is operated by Overtime, a media company aimed at Gen Z sports fans. Players receive a minimum $100,000 wage (which they can waive if they wish to retain college eligibility) and access to state-of-the-art training facilities in the 103,000 square-foot OTE Arena in Atlanta. They also get an education that includes “applicable professional skills training” classes, which focuses on topics such as financial literacy, media training and mental wellbeing. Amen and Ausar became the highest profile players to sign up for the league’s inaugural season back in 2021. They skipped their final year of high school and sacrificed college eligibility after agreeing to be paid a salary. It was a huge gamble to take: OTE had not yet been established as a viable option for young players, yet here were two highly-rated prospects blazing a trail and taking a risk. It paid off in a big way for the twins, who dominated the league as high-jumping, shot-swatting, consistently viral, highlight machines that moved at an electric pace and stifled offenses on the defensive end. Their draft positions were also a huge boost for OTE, which saw two of its prospects selected in the top five after only its second season. “It’s a really big vote of confidence for OTE,” said Omari Sankofa IIof the Detroit Free Press to CNN Sport. “[The coaches] talked about how they wanted to come in and really give athletes a modern platform to improve their skills and translate to the pros pretty quickly.” Leitao agrees that it helped to launch the twins’ careers, saying: “Whether they wanted to be, or we wanted them to be, they’ve become the face of Overtime Elite. It’s great for the growth of basketball, knowing that there’s not just one avenue to take to get to your dream.” Amen and Ausar are so frequently referred to as “the Thompson twins” that it is almost as if they are one unit. They are identical: both are 6 foot 7 inches tall and both possess otherworldly athletic ability. “If you’re not careful, you’re looking at the same person!” Leitao said. On the court is where they begin to diverge. “Although they have come up together their entire lives, they still have differences,” said Iko. “Amen is more of a primary ball handler, whereas Ausar is more of a point forward type role.” Amen, who plays the point guard position, recently suffered an ankle injury but showed flashes – both in preseason and in his brief first string of NBA games off the bench – of what he can provide for a team. Iko has been impressed by the “poise” he has shown. “His vision is through the roof,” he said. “The biggest thing that’s caught my attention is how quickly he moves the ball and how much he encourages unselfish team play.” His athleticism almost goes without saying at this point. “We’re talking about one of the top 10 most explosive players in the league by age 21,” Iko continued. Ausar, meanwhile, has started every regular season game at small forward for the Pistons and his rebounding and suffocating defensive ability (not typically a characteristic associated with rookies) have caught the eye. “It just seems like defensively, everything just moves really slow for him,” said Sankofa. “He has really good anticipation as far as knowing where the ball will be, where he needs to be, forcing steals. “Sometimes, it just seems like he knew what’s going to happen before it happened.” Ausar has had some flashyhighlight playson the offensive end, which have helped contribute to his side being dubbed the “Showtime Pistons” – a far cry from the notoriously physical “Bad Boys” of the ‘90s. Iko compares Amen to Deron Williams and Lamar Odom, while Sankofa sees shades of Scottie Pippen in Ausar (a “lofty comparison,” he admitted). Both see natural similarities between the twins and former NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala. Though the Thompsons excel in a multitude of areas, it is almost universally agreed that they need to work on their outside shooting. Ausar has been left wide open behind the three-point line by defenses so far, and he is not making the opposition pay. “That cramps the court for everybody else when defenses are able to pack in the way that they’ve been doing against the Pistons so far,” Sankofa says. Amen also struggles in this aspect, with Iko explaining that the Rockets rookie had been working with lead assistant and shooting guru Ben Sullivan to improve his jump shot mechanics. Fortunately, the twins have their whole careers ahead of them to iron out their flaws and are as determined as anyone to become the best players they can possibly be. “They can’t function unless they’re in the gym working on their game,” said Leitao, who appears immensely proud of the brothers. “I’m aware that you have to check certain boxes sometimes, especially in the NBA with all the money and all the things socially or humanistic that get in the way, but they’re as equipped as anybody to handle that and more when it comes to their growth and development. “They’re well on their way to becoming special.”","        7:00 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
135,CNN,Frederick Florin/AFP/Getty Images,Anna Cooban,"Jordi Ustrell expects his vineyard’s tinder-dry plants to produce about half of their usual 15,000 bottles of wine this year. “That’s a big loss,” the interim chief executive of Celler Devinssi, a small winery in the Spanish town of Gratallops,told CNN. Ustrell is one of scores of European winemakers struggling to grow enough grapes asextreme and unseasonable weatherbecomes more commonplace. High input costs and declining consumption are adding to the woes of small, independent wineries. According to the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group, global wine production isset to fallto its lowest level since 1961 this year, hit by soaring temperatures and extraordinary flooding. Fueling that decline are expected drops of 12% and 14% in output in Italy and Spain, the world’s biggest and third-biggest producers in 2022, respectively. Climate change is having a “tremendous” impact on wine production, Giogio Delgrosso, head ﻿of statistics at the OIV, told CNN. Delgrosso said that, in the past, extreme weather would strike every few years to interrupt long stretches of healthy, abundant harvests. “Now extreme climate events are always happening. Every year there’s something.” This year, heavy rainfall has helped mold spread through vineyards in central and southern Italy, while a severe drought and soaring temperatures have blighted vineyards in Spain. Other major wine producers, including Australia, South Africa and Chile, are expected to suffer drops of between 10% and 24% in output this year, according to OIV data, as floods, wildfires, droughts, and fungal disease have hammered vineyards. The changing climate is helping others, however. Output in the United States, the world’s fourth-largest producer, is forecast to grow 12% this year. Greg Jones, a climatologist and chief executive of Abacela, an Oregon-based winery, told CNN that, half a century ago, the state couldn’t grow grapes. Now, he said, rising temperatures have made Oregon “one of the top producing regions in the country.” Ust﻿rell in Spain has come to live with the unpredictable weather. For about two years now, it has hardly rained in Gratallops, which lies about 90 miles west of Barcelona. That has put serious stress on Ustrell’s vines. And snow, which seeps into the deepest layers of the soil, providing moisture for the vines during the dry summer months, hasn’t fallen once in that time. It’s little surprise, then, that Ustrell’s harvest of Cabernet Sauvignon — a variety of red wine grapes traditionally grown in France’s Bordeaux region, where conditions are more humid — was the first to, as he put it, “collapse” this year. Vineyards in Gratallops are so parched, he added, that 26 of its 28 wineries, including Celler Devinssi, have recently formed an association to lobby local authorities for funding to improve the water supply for irrigation, even if that means delivering huge vats of water into the town via truck. Celler Devinssi is not at risk of closure, but the 23-year-old firm’s bank account will almost certainly “be in the red” this year, according to Ustrell. Across the border, French winemakers are grappling with the opposite problem: Too much wine﻿. France is on track to pip Italy to become the world’s biggest producer this year, according to OIV data, up from second place in 2022. The country maintained the same level of production as last year thanks to more favorable weather. But the burgeoning supply of wine has exceeded waning demand in France and abroad, pushing down prices. The mismatch prompted French and European Union authorities toannouncea joint €200 million ($217 million) buyback scheme this summer, allowing French winemakers to sell their excess stock to distilleries for recycling into other alcoholic products like hand sanitizer. Falling prices have coincided with rising input costs. Over the past two years, a mix of soaring inflation and historically highenergy priceshas jacked up the cost of inputs like fertilizer, bottles and transportation fuel. Add to that higher interest rates, which have made borrowing to invest much costlier, and many winemakers’ already-narrow profit margins have all but disappeared. French winemakers struggling to sell their own produce have taken out their anger on imports from Spain. Hundreds of them descended on a major cross-border highway last month and stormed trucks transporting Spanish wine into France. The protestors smashed crates and emptied gallons of imported wine onto the road. Frédéric Rouanet, who organized the demonstration, explained to CNN that Spain makes many lower-priced wines and said the message to merchants was clear: “If you want to get cheap wine from Spain, you’ll have to buy our wine from us first.” Otherwise, said Rouanet, who runs an association of winemakers in Aude in France, the region’swineries simply “can’t get by.” Meanwhile, people around the world are drinking less wine than in previous years, opting for beer or spir﻿its instead, or ditching alcohol altogether. Globally, wine consumption has fallen about 6% between 2017 and 2022, OIV data shows, as consumers have changed their drinking habits andinflation has erodedtheir disposable income. That means nearly 1.9 billionfewer wine bottles were drunk last year than in 2017. Estimates for this year,citedby the European Commission in June, show even steeper declines across European countries, suggesting the trend may be accelerating. The multiplepressures have forced some vineyards to close their doors. Michael Baynes, co-founder of Vineyards-Bordeaux Christie’s International Real Estate, an investment advisory specializing in vineyards, said the number of winemakers selling up, while still a tiny fraction of all Bordeaux producers, had “dramatically increased” this year. “It’s a bloodbath,” he told CNN. “We’re seeing some very sad stories at the moment. A lot of multigeneration families are losing estates that they’ve nurtured for many years.” Their problems started 20 years ago, Baynes said, when Bordeaux’s lower-priced wines were forced into competition with “New World” wines — such as those from Chile, Argentina and Australia — that were rising in popularity. Surviving family-run wineries, and larger wineries selling into the lower end of the market, are in a precarious position, Baynes said. A bad harvest, a newexport tariff, anotherinterest rate hikecan be all it takes for a generations-old winery to shut for good. And “jittery and nervous” lenders aren’t coming to the rescue of wineries they suspect would struggle to repay expensiveloans, he added. “They are turning off the tap of lending.” “The families, the generations, the blood, sweat and toil that has gone into creating a lovely product may be lost forever.” Climate change was the reason John Mitra sold the Bordeaux vineyard he owned with his wife, Penelope, last year as it made predicting each year’s harvest too difficult. “It’s just too risky,” he told CNN. “Some years you would get 3,000 bottles off a hectare. Other years, you’d end up with 50. Unless you have substantial financial backing behind you, you can’t operate.” The couple have since moved 340 miles east to establish The Burgundy Wine Company, a merchant specializing in wines produced by small, independent vineyards. They chose the Burgundy region because it is very small, and so the wine produced there — less available, more coveted — fetches higher prices than wine ﻿from many other places. More and more of Mitra’s suppliers and friends in the industry are deciding to sell their vineyards, or taking advantage of a French government subsidy to uproot their vines and replant the land with new crops, or to simply turn it over to woodland. Some have replaced their vines with olive trees and kiwi plants, he said, because they are more resistant to drought. Mitra misses his previous occupation. For 12 months, through “rain or freezing cold,” he and his wife would tend to their vines. The two or three days spent harvesting the grapes each year made it all worthwhile, he said. Still, Mitra is happy to have chartered a new path in an industry he adores, and feels lucky to still be living among France’s fabled vineyards. “Now I just walk my dog in the vines, rather than own them.”","        11:54 AM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0

137,CNN,CNN,Unknown,"On September 25, 2000, Kevin Hines climbed over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge. White fog hung below the gray skies that day. He recalled looking down at the rough, green waters below moments before he did the unthinkable: He jumped. “My hands left the rail and I had an instantaneous regret for my actions,” Hines told CNN. Hines fell 220 feet at a speed of 75 miles per hour – “equivalent to a pedestrian being struck by a car that is traveling that fast,” according to the Bridge Rail Foundation, a nonprofit working to prevent suicides on the bridge. During the 4-second fall, Hines said the feeling of depression left his mind, and was replaced by a survival urge he described as almost instinctual. “And at that time, all I wanted to do was live.” After he was rescued from the water, Hines needed three vertebrae replaced with a titanium metal plate and pins, ultimately undergoing four and half weeks of recovery. And in the years since, Hines has been traveling the world to share his rare testimony. “I have met thousands of people who have survived mild, moderate to extreme suicide attempts who have all said they each had the same instant regret,” Hines said. “They recognized their thoughts didn’t have to become their actions.” More than a confirmed 1,800 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge since it was built in 1937, according tothe Bridge Rail Foundation. The very first incident happened that same year. Hines is one of 39 people known to survive the deadly leap. “Nineteen have come forward to say they all had the exact same instant regret that I had,” Hines said. After years of debate over installing a suicide deterrent on the iconic bridge, a net is now nearing completion. In 2018, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District began building a net along the perimeter of the 1.7 mile long bridge. The $217 million project consists of the installation of a stainless steel net, 20 feet below the sidewalk on both sides of the bridge, according to Golden Gate Bridge spokesperson Paolo Cosulich-Schwartz. “The amount of net that we’re installing is the equivalent of seven football fields,” Cosulich-Schwartz told CNN. It’s a project proponents hope will offer many people a second chance at life. While Hines noted not all those who jump may feel regretful, he said he can’t help but empathize with those who did experience the same feeling but never got another chance to choose life. “Recognizing that all the people that passed away might have wished they were still here… it’s a very troubling thing to think about,” he said. Kevin Berthia attempted to jump off the Golden Gate on March 11, 2005. But after jumping, he ended up clinging to a railing for over an hour and a half. “I swung myself around and smacked into the railing, and got on that 4-inch cord,” Berthia recalled. And he held onto that cord as California Highway Patrol Officer Kevin Briggs talked to him about reasons to choose life. It was in this 92-minute conversation that Berthia began to experience regret. While he credits Briggs for saving his life, Berthia also said he believes a safety net would have made a world of difference that day. “I looked over that rail and all I saw was the water,” Berthia told CNN. “If I saw a deterrent, I would have probably been like, ‘OK, maybe this is not meant to be.’” He desperately needed a sign that someone cared about him, Berthia added: “I needed something to say no.” While the purpose of the net is “to reduce the number of injuries and deaths from jumping off the bridge,” bridge spokesperson Cosulich-Schwartz said it’s also meant to serve as that sign Berthia was looking for 18 years ago. “The net is a symbol of hope and care for people who may be experiencing the worst day of their lives,” Cosulich-Schwartz said. “It is a large, visible and permanent symbol that there are people in the community that care about you,” he continued. “And, if necessary, offer people a second chance.” The net is currently 80% built, and is set to be completed in December, according to the bridge officials. The construction of this deterrent won’t be a temporary solution in suicide prevention, according to researchers. A1978 study of Golden Gate Bridge suicide attemptersfound more than 90% of those who were stopped remained alive decades later, and didn’t go on to take their own lives. Since the Golden Gate’s opening, suicide prevention groups and nonprofits like the Bridge Rail Foundation have continuously pushed for a deterrent of some sort on the bridge. “Originally, we wanted to raise the rail,” Hines said, which would be similar to the 11-foot steel fence that encloses the George Washington Bridge in New York City. The transportation district invited public comment on the potential project, and the opinions of the board and local residents were deeply divided. “We got shut down with that because it was obstructing the view and people didn’t want to ruin the aesthetics of the bridge,” Hines told CNN. “And I always say, what are the aesthetics of a bridge compared to one human life?” In 2014, the bridge’s board of directorsunanimously approved the fundingfor the safety net construction. “Engineers designed the Net to minimize impacts to Bridge views and appearance,” according to a Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District release, which noted the addition would still “slightly diminish the integrity of the the historic features.” Berthia acknowledged many people enjoy the beauty and history of the Golden Gate. “And I get that, but we don’t listen to enough people that have lost loved ones off that bridge,” he said. Thirty people or more die by suicide at the bridge each year on average, according to the release, with hundreds more stopped by law enforcement or other citizens. “Ultimately, a physical barrier is needed to stop this tragedy,” the release said. “The selected design allows open, scenic vistas to remain intact, while preventing anyone from easily jumping to the water below.” “I’m so grateful that not one more beautiful person with loved ones, and family and friends who care for them is ever again, gonna die by their hands off of the Golden Gate Bridge,” Hines said. “I thank God every day I get to be alive to see it.”","        9:35 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
138,CNN,Noemi Cassanelli/CNN,Unknown,"A golden face with patinaed turquoise eyes stares out of the darkness. Illuminated around it stand three other bronze heads — some have flat tops, others round — all looked over by a giant bronze statue almost 9 feet high. All have the same piercing, angular eyes. There’s something about the “Faces of Sanxingdui” — as this collection of sculptures is being billed — that feels both familiar and alien. Currently on display at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, they may appear Mayan or Aztec to the untrained eye, but these over-3,000-year-old sculptures weren’t unearthed anywhere near Mesoamerica’s ancient civilizations. They were discovered on China’s Chengdu Plain, at an archeological dig site called Sanxingdui (which translates as “three star mound”). Thought to be the largest and oldest site left by the Shu kingdom, a civilization in southwestern China once only hinted at in myths and legends, Sanxingdui was not discovered until the 1920s, when a farmer stumbled across objects while digging an irrigation ditch. The site has since been found to contain the ruins of an ancient city made up of residences, sacrificial pits and tombs enclosed by high dirt walls. Archaeologists from the Sanxingdui Museum say the city was established some 4,800 to 2,800 years ago, until it was abandoned around 800 BC for unknown reasons. The Chinese government has long promoted Sanxingdui as evidence of the country’s long, uninterrupted history — with the discoveries included in history textbooks for more than a decade. And while thousands of visitors have already flocked to the groundbreaking exhibition in Hong Kong, some analysts suggest that the items are also being used to support the Chinese government’s vision of national identity. The Shu kingdom, which emerged in the Sichuan basin during the Bronze Age, is believed to have developed independently of the Yellow River Valley societies  traditionally considered the cradle of Chinese civilization. Its inhabitants created exquisitely crafted bronze, jade, gold and ceramic objects, depicting fantastical beasts, kings, gods and shamans with bulging eyes and enlarged ears. Around 120 of the items are currently on display in Hong Kong, and it’s the first time many of these objects, most of which were excavated between 2019 and 2022, have been showcased outside Sichuan province. Remarkably, the sculptures predate the Terracotta Army, a collection of earthenware statues depicting the armies of China’s first emperor Qin Shi Huang, by at least 1,000 years. Wang Shengyu, an assistant curator at the Palace Museum told CNN said the objects are far more advanced, imaginative, and artistic than those being produced anywhere else in China at that time. “You can tell that it’s very sculptural and very artsy,” Wang told CNN at the exhibition opening, pointing to a roughly 1-foot-tall bronze figure whose fantastical, braided hair extends out to three times the height of its body and, had it not been broken, would stretch much further. “You can imagine how magnificent it was. From above his nose and all the way up, it would’ve been over 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall, according to the fragments (archeologists) found. The end of the pigtail is on his shoulder.” Little is known about the Shu kingdom other than what’s been discovered on the 3.6-square-kilometer (1.4-square-mile) site outside Chengdu. There is no evidence of a written Shu language, and historical literature contains scant information about its culture other than a handful of myths and legends, including a reference to a Shu king called Can Cong whose eyes were said to have protruded — perhaps explaining why so many of the 13,000 relics recovered from the site feature bulging eyes. After the Shu state was conquered by the Qin dynasty in 316 BC, Shu culture was “buried” under the “mainstream” culture that later emerged on China’s central plain, Chinese authorities wrote in a 2013 UNESCO submission seeking to have Sanxingdui and two nearby archeological sites recognized as World Heritage Sites. They are currently on UNESCO’s “tentative list.” Since 1986, eight excavated pits at Sanxingdui have yielded giant masks of gods with bulbous, insect-like eyes and protruding ears, mythical creatures with gaping mouths and an almost 4-meter-tall (13-foot) bronze “tree of life” sculpture decorated with ornaments like a Christmas tree. All the items were found shattered, burned and buried, leading experts to believe the pits were used for ritual sacrifices. Some have now been painstakingly re-constructed by archaeologists. “It took 10 years to reconstruct the tree,” said Wang Shengyu, an assistant curator at the museum who helped curate the exhibition. That tree is not on show in Hong Kong, as it is considered too precious to send abroad, but a section of one of six others discovered and ornaments are on display at the museum, as well as a 3D holographic projection of what experts think it would have looked like – its layers and branches adorned with birds, flowers, fruit, dragons, bells as well as jade and gold foil ornaments. The set are thought to have been part of a theater space. The exhibition places these items in the context of other ancient civilizations and includes the Shu among the many societies to have existed in the country’s “5,000-year history.” According to a press release from organizers, museum and Hong Kong government officials at the opening stressed the “continuity, inventiveness, unity, inclusiveness and emphasis on peace and harmony” of Chinese history. Henry Tang, chairman of the governing body behind the West Kowloon Cultural District (where the Palace Museum is located) and a former candidate for Hong Kong’s top leadership role, said in a statement that the district and museum are looking to “promote cultural and artistic exchanges between China and the world, ‘tell China’s story well’, and strengthen the public’s cultural self-confidence.” But the narrative that the Shu kingdom was innately Chinese is contentious, according to Ian Johnson, a senior fellow for China Studies at US think tank, the Council on Foreign Relations. “Over the past few decades, the (Chinese Communist Party) has been trying to push a historical myth that all the peoples who have ever lived inside the current borders of the People’s Republic are ‘Chinese,’” he told CNN over email. “The basic idea is that the PRC (People’s Republic of China) encompasses people who naturally belong together and therefore, from today’s standpoint, form a nation. Hence any effort to have autonomy or even independence is taboo — it runs against history.” The People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, and its government has often used China’s continuous history as evidence that ethnic groups such as the Tibetans and the Uyghurs have always belonged to China. Johnson said that there was little support for the idea that civilizations along the Yellow River had much in common with those in the Sichuan Basin. “They have commonalities but are not the same — just as ancient Assyrians and Phoenicians and Greeks weren’t the same, even if they shared certain things in common,” he said, adding: “sponsoring these kinds of exhibitions are popular and win the government credit.” When asked to comment, the Hong Kong Palace Museum said the exhibition was “curated based on academic and archaeological research” and that it reinforces its mission to deepen audiences’ “understanding of the lives and cultures of various regions and ethnic groups as well as exchanges among them in ancient China, which have contributed to the magnificence of China’s civilization and its ‘diversity in unity’ pattern of development.”","        10:25 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0

140,CNN,,Ashley Strickland,"To say that space is a challenging environment is putting it lightly. During a recent spacewalk outside the International Space Station, a tool bag got away from NASA astronauts Jasmin Moghbeli and Loral O’Hara. The bag has gone into orbit around Earth andmay be visible through binocularsuntil it disintegrates in our planet’s atmosphere. Meanwhile, Mars and Earth are now orbiting on the opposite sides of the sun, temporarily disrupting communications between NASA and its robotic explorers investigating the red planet. Until the solar conjunction ends on November 25, the fleet of orbiters and rovers havesizable to-do lists they can work throughbefore it’s time to check in with ground control once more. Zero gravity, harsh radiation and vast distances are just some of the obstacles to space exploration that require years of technological development and research to overcome. And after months of rebuilding following an explosive initial launchin April, Space X made a second attempt at launching its deep-space rocket system Starship, but not all went according to plan. The uncrewed Starship spacecraft launchedaboard themost powerful rocket ever builton Saturday morning, but both were lost shortly after liftoff. The Super Heavy rocket booster ignited its 33 massive engines and Starship experienced a safe liftoff. Space X tried “hot staging” for the first time, essentially a step in which the spacecraft separated from the rocket booster by blunt force trauma. After hot staging, the rocket booster exploded in a fireball over the Gulf of Mexico. Starship initially continued on just fine before Space X lost the spacecraft’s signal and triggered the system’s software to terminate the flight so it didn’t veer off course. Starship was intended to fly nearly a lap around the planet before returning to Earth, but data from this second test flight will be used to determine Space X’s next steps in making humanity “multiplanetary.” Pests such as head lice have existed as long as humans have — and analysis of their DNA is providing an unexpected window into the first people to live in the Americas. When modern humans ventured from Africa and began to settle around the globe, head lice hitched a ride with them. Two distinct populations of head lice emerged. But scientists recently discoveredevidence of hybrid licethat may represent a “signal of contact between Europeans and Native Americans,” said Marina Ascunce, a research molecular biologist at the US Department of Agriculture. The puffadder shyshark is just one of the many unique marine creatures that dwell only within the Great African Sea Forest off the coast of South Africa. While the diminutive shark’s markings resemble a venomous South African snake, it is anything but confrontational. True to its name, theshyshark wraps its tail over its eyesand curves its bodies to protect itself from predators. But the tiny shark species is disappearing and listed as endangered. Now, conservationists are hoping that using artificial intelligence called Fin Spotter will protect the population before it reaches a critical tipping point. Seismic activity in Iceland — home to 32 active volcanoes — suggests that aneruption may be imminent, according to the nation’s civil protection agency. Experts are tracking a corridor of subterranean molten material now spanning 9 miles (15 kilometers) in the island’s southwestern peninsula that could affect the coastal town of Grindavík. While the country is no stranger to volcanic eruptions, there are concerns over the nature of the potential explosion, which could occur underwater or on land. Separately, theworld’s newest island, formed by an undersea volcanic eruption, has appeared off the coast of Japan’s Iwo Jima in the Pacific Ocean. Astronomers have spotted a highly unusual stellar corpse that came back to life in violent throes that continued for months after it initially exploded. The rare cosmic phenomenon, called a luminous fast blue optical transient, is brighter and fades more quickly than a typical supernova.

141,CNN,Batchelder/Alamy Stock Photo,Lilit Marcus,"In Japan, gardening isn’t just a hobby – it’s an art form with spiritual significance. But while gardens across the country get lots of love on social media, many Japanese will swear their fealty to one that’s off the beaten track – the garden at the Adachi Museum of Art in bucolic Shimane prefecture, a three-hour train trip from Osaka. The US-based Sukiya Living magazine (formerly Journal of Japanese Gardening) has awarded the Adachi Museum its highest honor – most beautiful traditional garden – for more than 20 years running. Despite accolades coming from outside of Japan, the museum and gardens remain relatively unknown compared to those in Kyoto and Tokyo. Many Western visitors to Japan are confused when they visit a Japanese garden, only to not see a single flower. Japanese gardens place emphasis on different kinds of plants, like moss or trees, or may just consist of rocks in a finely manicured bed of sand. They’re not just about big, colorful blooms – there’s a more subtle dynamic at play. “Gardens in Japan do aspire to high art in a way that they don’t in the West,” explains Sophie Walker, author of the book “The Japanese Garden.” “Mitateis the idea that the imagination can leap. You can see a rock, know that it’s a human-scale rock, but in that moment you can come to it and see it as a mountain. So I think that’s why the garden is so powerful, because it depends on the viewer. What you bring to it matters the mind with which you come.” On the walls of the Adachi Museum of Art are paintings by some of Japan’s best modern artists. But many patrons ignore the building entirely and prefer to spend their entire visit looking out the window. Here, the different gardens – a pine grove, a rock garden and a moss garden, among others – are intended to be seen but not trampled through. They were conceived like paintings, made from trees and plants rather than oil and pastel. In turn, the museum was designed to “frame” the garden, with its large picture windows specifically made to highlight the garden’s most notable features. “Japanese paintings are difficult to appreciate, even when people come to see them, whereas gardens are easy for anyone to look at,” explains Takodori Adachi, the grandson of founder Zenko Adachi and the current director of the museum. “Before looking at Japanese paintings, you can look at these Japanese gardens and understand them in this sequence. The art museum was designed so it would be easier to look at.” Signs in Japanese and English apologize that gardeners or other maintenance workers may be toiling in the garden during the day – a way of acknowledging that there are human beings behind the gardens’ seemingly effortless elegance. Getting to the museum itself is a journey. Shimane and its neighbor Tottori are the two least-populous prefectures in all of Japan, comprising part ofthe rural San’in region. But, as Adachi explains, the reason the gardens are so special isn’t just because of what’s in them – it’s because of what’s around them. “The Japanese gardens are integrated with the mountains in the background,” he says. “There are Japanese gardens in Kyoto, shrines and other places, but they are small and compact. As soon as you enter this museum, you feel a sense of unity with the mountain behind you. “These kinds of Japanese gardens were created precisely by virtue of this location, so the charm of the Adachi Museum of Art cannot be conveyed anywhere else.” Another way to experience the scenery is by stopping by one of the museum’s tea rooms. Here, guests can enjoy matcha and sweets while drinking up the views as well, with windows designed for the best possible angles. Japan’s glamorous high-speed Shinkansen trains don’t come here. Instead, travelers can travel on the express train beginning in Osaka or Tokyo going as far as Okayama, then switch to a slower local train that plods northward across the island of Honshu until they arrive in Matsue, the capital of Shimane. To get to Adachi, travelers should catch the local commuter train from Matsue to the smaller town of Yasugi. At Yasugi train station, there is a free shuttle that ferries people back and forth to the museum. There are just 28 seats on the bus, which can become an issue in peak summer and spring travel seasons as queues begin early in the day. Return trips to Yasugi are free, but guests should pick up a laminated ticket from the Adachi lobby as a way to reserve their spot back, especially if they are trying to get a specific return train. The Matsue tourist information center, in a glass box directly outside of Matsue station, has helpful maps and train schedules printed out in English and Japanese. The Adachi Museum’s multiple gift shops are also worth some time. Rather than just selling postcards and other items printed with popular pieces from the museum, the shops – which are located in standalone buildings between the bus stop and the museum entrance – highlight specialties from Shimane, mostly in the form of food and drink. Some highlights include a line of craft beer named after Lafcadio Hearn, the Greek-born writer who spent much of his life living in Matsue, soft-serve ice cream that is flavored with wild pears growing in the region and genji maki – sweets with red bean paste inside mini crepe-like pancakes rolled up into triangles. Other than the soft serve, most products come pre-packaged in prettily decorated boxes, making them an easy choice for souvenirs. And just like everything else at Adachi, even the items in the shops were immaculately planned down to the smallest cookie. “If (the museum) becomes famous, it will also promote the local area,” Adachi’s director explains. For now, though, the museum is an oasis in a country coping with overtourism at some of its more popular destinations. Mount Fuji, for instance, is battling the real-time repercussions ofhaving too many visitors. The sacred site is now dealing with garbage, erosion, and “reckless” hikers, resulting in concerns that it could lose its UNESCO World Heritage status.

143,CNN,How Las Vegas is betting big on a lucrative industry,Alicia Wallace,"When Formula 1 racecars rip along the iconic Las Vegas Strip this Sunday, it will serve as another highly visible reminder of a significant shift in the city’s economy. In under a decade’s time, the desert city long known for its casinos, food and live entertainment has become the home tofourmajorleaguesports teams (the latest being MLB’s Athletics), six minor league teams, a major sports organization in the Ultimate Fighting Champion, and four large sports venues playing host to events such as NCAA tournament games, NFL Pro Bowls, and, coming this February, Super Bowl LVIII. At least a half-dozen more venues are in the planning stages, and the city appears poised to be one of the top picks for an NBA expansion team and an MLS team, as well. “Ten years ago, leagues didn’t even want to look at us twice,” said Andrew Woods, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “Now it feels like we’re the belle of the ball.” Las Vegas a sports metropolis? It’s a potentially lucrative development that could spell expansion and a broader economic base for the city; however, it comes with growing pains. The initial economic impact estimates for Sunday’s Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prixand the February 2024 Super Bowl were $1.3 billion, and $500 million, respectively. (But this was beforeticket prices slid for F1when the championship was won earlier in the season). That total would match the estimated $1.8 billion contributed to the metro area by all sporting events from July 2021 to June 2022, according to aneconomic impact studyreleased this summer by the Center for Business and Economic Research at UNLV’s Lee Business School. With bigger events, however,come biggerchallenges. Construction and preparationfor the F1 racegnarled traffic, agitating locals in the process. Also drawing the ire of longtime residents and visitors are the (initially) exorbitant prices and the potentially blocked views of everything from the Bellagio fountains to the Mirage volcano, due to the temporary grandstand and signage. “There are questions about do we have adequate infrastructure that can handle bigger and bigger events,” Woods said. “How do we make this beneficial for both a community that could soon have 3 million residents and have 50 million visitors a year and make that work for everyone?” And initially, it doesn’t appear that all are benefitting equally from the double-down on sports. In reviewing the intensity of sports in the Las Vegas area, Woods and his team noticed a troubling trend: “sports deserts,” a lack of access to facilities. Some communities, especially those that have been underserved in the past, might not have the same access to parks, local sports businesses and facilities, they found. Woods said more research needs to be done to confirm the initial findings. Sports have been deeply engrained in Las Vegas for decades, going back to the boxing heyday of the 1950s and 1960s and the rise of sports betting. Super Bowl Sundays and March Madness tournaments typically bring packed casinos and sportsbooks. But for many decades, the NFL and other leagues opposed having sport franchises in Las Vegas, most likely due to the city’s deeply rooted gambling industry. At one point, the city couldn’t run a tourism ad during the Super Bowl. By 2017, the sentiment had started to shift — including among league commissioners like the NFL’s Roger Goodell — as the National Hockey League as well as the Oakland Raiders had plansto set up shop there. “I think society in general has a bit of a change with respect to gambling in general,” Goodell said during a March 2017 press conference. “Vegas is not the same city it was 10 or 20 years ago. It is a much more diverse city, it has become an entertainment mecca.” He added: “They made a very compelling proposal, which the ownership obviously approved overwhelmingly.” Then came the 2018 ruling from the Supreme Court striking down a federal law that prohibited commercial sports betting in most states. As sports betting exploded into people’s living rooms, Vegas remained at the center of that digital industry — being home to the casino operators that backed those sportsbooks and online gambling companies such as Fan Duel. The rise of sports betting and continued explosion in fantasy football created additional interest in sports and, in turn, back in Vegas, said Steve Hill, chief executive officer of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “Vegas fans tend to be sports fans, too, and sports have helped us expand the customer base that are willing to consider Las Vegas,” Hill said. Last year, 6% of surveyed visitors attended a sporting event, up from 3% in 2019, and 4% of visitors said sporting events were the primary reason for a Vegas trip, according to the LVCVA 2022 Las Vegas Visitor Profile Study. “I think the city and our businesses are taking a big bet that both these percentages are going to grow,” said Woods of UNLV, “that we could see those percentages double in the near-term here, in the next two, three, four years as we add more sporting events.” The city that billed itself as the “Entertainment Capital of the World” has now rebranded as the “Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World.” Sports are growing in Las Vegas, but leisure and hospitality remain the city’s bread and butter. In Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is located, one in four workers are in the leisure and hospitality sector, and $1 for every $3 are generated by those businesses, Woods said. And during the past two years, Las Vegas and other tourist-centric cities have benefitted from consumers’post-pandemic splurges on experiences and travel versus goods. Nevada’s monthly gaming revenue this year outpaced pre-pandemic levels and notched a nominal record monthly high in July at $1.4 billion, according to Nevada Gaming Control Board data. Having that deep concentration in one industry can be positive when times are good, but if there’s an economic downswing, it can be devastating for a local economy. In April 2020, Covid-19 shutdowns resulted in unemployment spiking in Las Vegas to a startling 34%, as the metro area became thehardest-hit in the United States. “The Strip was shut down, and that’s where revenue for services is generated and it’s where the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people is generated, and it was awful and scary at the time,” Hill said. As the pandemic wore on, construction continued on expanding the Las Vegas Convention Center as well as the Raiders’ Allegiant Stadium, among other projects. “The city continued to bet on itself,” Hill said. “And that really paid off.” Although the sports events industry is nested within the leisure and hospitality sector, there are some early indications that the investments could spur diversification of the regional economy, through the rise of ancillary businesses in areas such as services, marketing and medicine. The number of businesses in sports instruction has seen a 156% increase in the past 10 years, according to UNLV’s research. And youth sports participation, especially among girls and young women, has seen marked increases, according to the report. “Anytime you can broaden what drives the economy, it’s a stabilizing influence and maybe a growth influence, too,” Hill said. “When it comes to, particularly, team sports, it doesn’t matter what’s going on in the economy, you’re going to have those events, and it’s a reason for people to decide to come to Las Vegas.”","        8:11 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
144,CNN,Why people including Walmart’s CEO are sounding the alarm about deflation,Unknown,"After encountering rapid price increases for more than two years, discounts at some stores would certainly feel like a much-needed respite. But business leaders, economists and investment moguls aren’t so gung-ho about it. Tech investor Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Investment Management,told The Wall Street Journalin a story published on Wednesday she’s more worried about deflation, when prices fall, than the inverse — inflation. “We’re seeing more and more signs of it,” she said, referring to deflation. Falling prices of commodities like copper and lumber “negatively impacted”Home Depot’s third-quarter earnings, CEO Ted Decker told investors on the company’s earnings call earlier this week. “As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $545 in the third quarter of 2022, representing a decrease of over 20%,” Home Depot’s executive vice president of merchandising, Billy Bastek, added on the call. “Big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 5.2% compared to the third quarter of last year,” Bastek said. One of the first lessons students learn in Economics 101 is that when the price of a good is higher, people demand less of it. And when the price of a good is lower, people demand more of it. But the problem with deflation is that when people begin to expect lower prices in the future, they have little incentive to make purchases right now. For instance, unless it was absolutely necessary, why would you buy a new oven today if you thought the price would go down significantly in a month? When enough people think that way, it causes massive pullbacks in spending. That can prompt a recession if it means businesses can’t afford to employ as many workers. Deflation is not a problem across the board in the United States, which, like many countries, is experiencing inflation. In China, however, prices across all goods and services were0.2% lower in Octobercompared to the same month last year. US consumer prices are 3.2% higher compared to a year ago, according tothe latest Consumer Price Index. But even though Americans are still paying more for goods and services compared to a year ago, the pace of the increases has slowed significantly. That said, many goods in the United States are a lot cheaper than they were a year ago. For instance, prices for eggs are 22% lower, the second-biggest year-over-year price cut behind health insurance, according to October CPI data. Walmart CEO Doug Mc Millon said on Thursday consumers could soonencounter more uniform price cuts at grocery stores. He also warned that US-based Walmarts could enter “a deflationary environment.” Besides eggs, other cheaper goods include airfares, gasoline, appliances and smartphones. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, referred to this as “selective deflation.” For now, he said, “it’s helping to push overall inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target with minimal pain in terms of unemployment and lost output.” “In other words, it’s making a soft landing possible,” he told CNN.","        5:00 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
145,CNN,"Major advertisers flee X, deepening crisis at Elon Musk’s social media site",Brian Fung,"A torrent of prominent brands halted their advertising on X on Friday, dealing a massive reputational blow to Elon Musk’s social media company after hispublic embrace this week of an antisemitic conspiracy theoryfavored by White supremacists. The high-profile advertiser revolt includes some of the world’s largest media companies, such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent of CNN. X also reportedly lost Apple, according to multiple news outlets including Axios, which firstreported Apple’s withdrawal. Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The dizzying pace and scope of the withdrawals from X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, comes amid a widening backlash against Musk for his increasingly vocal endorsement of extremist beliefs. And it casts fresh doubts on the future of a business that Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino had vowed would become profitable once more as early as next year. The companies’ advertising pauses follow a similar move by IBM on Thursday. Ads for IBM and other major brands werefound appearing alongside pro-Nazi contenton the platform, according to a report on Thursday by progressive media watchdog group Media Matters. In a statement, IBM explicitly called out what it described as an “entirely unacceptable situation.” “IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” an IBM spokesperson said. In ablog postresponding to Friday’s brand exodus, X accused Media Matters of aggressively searching for pro-Nazi content in a way that “misrepresented the real user experience” and could “mislead advertisers.” The company noted that the pro-Nazi posts cited in the report had little engagement; one of the posts mentioned has since had its visibility reduced under X’s “Freedom of Speech, not Reach” policy. In a post on X early Saturday morning, Musk threatened a lawsuit against Media Matters. The group’s president responded in a statement to CNN, saying, “If he does sue us, we will win.” “Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully who threatens meritless lawsuits in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate,” Media Matters President Angelo Carusone said in the statement. “Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified.” In a social media post on Friday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote that “X has been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There’s absolutely no place for it anywhere in the world.” “At risk of stating the obvious, anyone advocating the genocide of *any* group will be suspended from this platform,” Muskwrote on XFriday evening. Ananalysisby the watchdog group Media Matters found this week that in addition to IBM, ads by Apple, Comcast, NBC and Oracle had appeared alongside similar content. Spokespersons for Oracle have not responded to requests for comment. A spokesperson for X said the pro-Nazi accounts identified in Thursday’s Media Matters report would no longer be eligible for monetization, meaning ads would no longer be run on those pages. In August, two other brands, NCTA — the Internet and Television Association — and Gilead Sciencespaused their spendingon X after their ads were also run alongside pro-Nazi content.","        11:38 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
146,CNN,Here’s why the Big Three won’t need to raise car prices to pay for these labor deals,Chris Isidore,"The new labor contracts between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors, Ford and Stellantis will make a big difference in the paychecks of 145,000 autoworkers. It will raise their pay at least 11% immediately, and likely more than 30% over the life of the contract. But it’s not going to make much difference in the prices you have to pay when buying your next car. “Thelabor contractsdon’t mean you go to a dealership and the car costs more money,” said Ivan Drury, analyst for sales tracker Edmunds. “If wages go up 11%, an overnight change in prices is not realistic. The end result is that for the consumers, the labor cost doesn’t mean a lot.” Part of the reason is that labor makes up only about 7% of the overall cost of building a car. Raw materials, like the steel and aluminum in the bodywork, the rubber in the tires and the dozens of computer chips that control so many aspects of a modern auto,have a much greater impact. But the fact is that the three unionized automakers still have to compete in the market with nonunion automakers. Ford, GM, and Stellantis account for less than half of US vehicle sales. And even though some of those nonunion automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundaihave announced their own pay increases in the wake of the UAW deal, perhaps due to concerns about the threat of the UAW organizing their own employees, thoughthere are still plenty of automakers who are not raising wages. If the Big Three could simply pass along higher costs, be it raw material, labor other expenses, in the form of higher prices, no automaker would ever lose money. That’s clearly not reality. “The automakers will have difficulty passing those costs onto consumers,” said Michelle Krebs, analyst with Cox Automotive. Even if the labor costs could be passed along in terms of higher prices, it woudn’t be nearly as much as you might think. The labor deal is likely to raise the cost of building vehicles by $950 per car, according to Ford CFO John Lawler. But that $950 is the total increased cost from the labor contracts that will be paid over the course of four-and-a-half years of the contract. Or about $200 more per year, with less of that increased expense coming in the near term and more at the end of the contract. Any additional labor costs are more likely to eat into automaker profits than they are to raise prices. Ford reported that it earned about $3,000 before interest and taxes for every gas or hybrid vehicle sold to consumers in the first 9 months of the year. So a few hundred dollars a year in higher labor costs aren’t going to break the companies, or send them back to the massive losses that they experienced in the first decade of this century. Car prices are driven far more by supply and demand than by the cost of the vehicle. The average transaction price reached $48,760 in October, according to Edmunds’ data. That’s less than $50 below therecord average car price setin December of 2022, and it’s up about $10,600, or 28%, from the average price in October 2017. That substantial price increase was not driven by an increase in costs, labor or otherwise. It was driven mostly by strong demand for autos, and a limited supply of vehicles due to the shortage of some parts, most notably computer chips. That led to a period in which most buyers were being forced to pay above the manufacturers’ suggested retail price, or “sticker price.” In past years, very few car buyers ever had to pay above sticker price for a car. Most American new car buyers aren’t actually buying directly from automakers, but fromdealerships, which are independent businesses that buy cars in bulk from automakers at wholesale prices, and sell them at whatever price the market will bear. Another factor driving car prices higher was the desire of consumers to buy cars with more features and options that are now available but were not available in the past. And the demand for those extra features are among the factors raising the average price of a car, even if the price of the most basic, stripped down models havenot increased as rapidly.","        12:30 PM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
147,CNN,There was unusually high demand for $50 bills in the US last year. Here’s why,Unknown,"Unless you’re an avid currency collector, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, or work at the Federal Reserve, you likely didn’t know that last year a record number of $50 bills were printed. Last year, the government printed 756,096,000 of those bills — the highest total of the denomination printed in one year in more than 40 years. If you put all those $50s together, you’d have about $37.8 billion. That’s enough to afford Taco Bell’s parent Yum Brands, Inc.$35.3 billion market cap. Usually, the $50 bill is an uncommon, somewhat unpopular, denomination. There are even multiple superstitions that it is unlucky. (More on that later.) In 2019, only 3.5% of all US bills printed were $50s. In 2022, that zoomed to 8.5%, according to the BEP. So why are you seeing more $50s? Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with inflation — even if it may sometimes feel these days like an item that used to cost $20 now costs $50. (Luckily, the rate at which inflation has grown slowed to 3.2% in Octoberfrom its peak of 9.1% last June.) Instead, it all began with the pandemic. People started hoarding cash, the Fed discovered. And it’s easier to squirrel away bigger bills. In July 2021, the Fed noted its “2022print orderis heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic… the Federal Reserve continues to experience unprecedented demand for currency.” A subsequent report from the San Francisco Fed confirmed that, after 2020, Americans began to carry more cash in their wallets, cars, houses and elsewhere. So, the Fed ordered a big uptick in $50s. Until the pandemic, the $50 had been one of the rarest bills ordered for years, save for the $2 bill. But for 2021 and 2022,the Fed ordered up more $50s than $10s and $5s. To understand why so many $50 bills were printed, it’s important to know how the system of printing money works.The Fed doesn’t print any physical money itself; it estimates the anticipated demand for currency and the rate of decay of bills already in circulation. Then, it orders the money from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the government agency that prints paper money. The US Mint produces coins. Few people really love the $50. There’s an old superstition that, because President Ulysses S. Grant is on the face of the $50, and he notoriously went bankrupt, the bills are jinxed. (The $50 bill dates to 1862, but Grant’s face wasn’t added until 1914.) Back in 2010, North Carolina Republican Representative Patrick Mc Henry even attempted to introduce a measure into Congress to replace 18th President Grant with 40th President Ronald Reagan. The effort got some support but ultimately went nowhere. Professional gamblers and casinos reportedly don’t like to carry the bills, considering them a jinx and partially because Las Vegas casino investor and gangster Bugsy Siegel was rumored to have died with only $50s in his pocket. But, more likely, and more realistically, people tend to avoid using $50 bills due to them being confused with $5 or $20 bills and many stores not accepting bills larger than $20. A surge in demand for physical money amid a lockdown might not make sense at first glance. Especially given that, as Covid-19 set in, businesses across the United States closed their customer-facing storefronts temporarily and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondiscouraged the use of cash. But demand for physical cash and actually paying with cashare two separate things, according to analysts at the San Francisco Fed. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty naturally causes unease, prompting many people to hold on to cash that they may not immediately try and spen, they concluded. Their data also shows Americans are using physical cash less in daily purchases, and the amount being held by consumers still remains elevated when compared to before the pandemic. The printing of various denominationshas returned to normal levels this year, as shown by the Fed’s 2023 and 2024 print orders. The Fed in its 2023 order said its primary driver now in currency orders is the need to replace damaged notes ($50s last 12.2 years on average,according to the Fed; dollar bills last about half as long.) The Fed placed its2024currency order in July, with an anticipated volume of $50 bills in the range of 99,200,000 to 211,200,000 notes, less than one-third of the 2022 printing. But cash holdings for American householdsremain elevated compared to pre-pandemic times, the San Francisco Fed report shows, noting that consumers “continue to hold a significant amount of cash that may be unlikely to be used for daily purchases.”","        9:30 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
148,CNN,Jorrit van Waalwijk van Doorn and Jasmijn van Waalwijk van Doorn,Francesca Street,"The first time Jasmijn van Waalwijk van Doorn accompanied her pilot father, Jorrit van Waalwijk van Doorn, to work was a day to remember. It was 2006. Eight-year-old Jasmijn joined Jorrit on a KLM flight traveling from their home country of the Netherlands to Uganda. Pilot Jorrit flew the Boeing 767 there and back. Jasmijn and her mother Ellen were passengers.  Before the flight to Uganda took off, Ellen took a picture of her husband and daughter in the cockpit. In the photo, Jorrit’s clutching the controls, Jasmijn is clutching a beloved lion toy. She’s got one arm around her father. Both are smiling widely. Cut to 2019. Jorrit and Jasmijn once again found themselves in an airplane cockpit together. It was another day to remember. This time round, Jasmijn wasn’t a passenger – she was a qualified KLM pilot, flying alongside her dad for the first time. When Jasmijn packed her suitcase that morning, she’d made sure to include the beloved lion toy among her belongings. Then, before the flight took off, Jasmijn and Jorrit recreated the photo from over a decade previously. Once again, Jorrit clutched the controls and Jasmijn clutched the lion toy. Both smiled proudly. The main difference between the photos? The now adult Jasmijn is wearing a KLM pilot uniform. And right after the photo was taken, Jasmijn got behind the controls, ready to fly the Boeing 777 to Hong Kong. It was Jasmijn’s mother Ellen who suggested her husband and daughter recreate the 2006 photo. “She said, ‘We have that picture of the two of you in the cockpit. Why not take the toy again, and take the same picture again?’” Jasmijn tells CNN Travel. “I was happy that I still had the toy because it’s so special to have that picture.” “It started off as a fun thing,” Jorrit tells CNN Travel. “But it was nice to see the two pictures together, then and now.” The 2006 flight to Uganda was the first of many times young Jasmijn accompanied Jorrit on flights. Jasmijn remembers how exciting it was going on a safari and spotting lions that resembled her beloved cuddly toy. Eight-year-old Jasmijn fell in love with traveling – and then, over time, she fell in love with flying. “That’s how I got to know the job – and where it started,” says Jasmijn. When Jasmijn was growing up, Jorrit flew intercontinental flights for KLM. He was often gone for several days. If he could bring Jasmijn and her siblings with him, he would. “You can invest in your relationship with your kid, and she can see what you’re doing. And then it’s more normal for her,” he says. “We’d always do nice things on routes.” Jasmijn’s mother Ellen is a flight attendant, so flying for a living was “normal” to Jasmijn growing up. “It’s not only because of my dad that I’m interested in aviation,” she says. Jasmijn aspired to be a pilot from an early age. At 12, she had her first flying lesson. Aged 14, she embarked on a gliding course. By the time she was in high school, Jasmijn was set on her career path. “That’s when it became serious,” she says today. “I thought, ‘This is my dream, I want to be a pilot.’” Jasmijn trained at the KLM Flight Academy, qualifying in 2018 when she was 20. Since that first flight together in 2019, Jorrit and Jasmijn have flown together 17 times. The father daughter pilot duo quickly learned how to segue between familial comfort and professionalism – for example, Jasmijn decided early on that it made sense to call her dad by his first name when they were on the clock together. Jorrit says flying together was always “very natural”, adding that they’ve got a “nice dynamic.” Jorrit and Jasmijn take their jobs seriously, but their flights together are always infused with fun. They enjoy finding humor and joy in the air. As the more junior of the pair, Jasmijn also appreciates the opportunity to learn from Jorrit’s experience and watch him at work, but Jorrit says this education goes both ways. “She’s a new generation pilot,” he says. “The way she looks at things is a little bit different than how I learned to do it.” Before every flight, airline crew are sent what’s called a crew manifest – a list of who’s going to be working that day’s flight, usually with an accompanying photo. Colleagues often figure out Jasmijn and Jorrit are related thanks to their shared last name, but if they don’t pick up on that, it’s the crew manifest photos which give it away: Jasmijn and Jorrit use a selfie of the two of them, cropped into two individual portraits. They always enjoy seeing who puts two and two together. And when fellow KLM employees realize they’re related, Jasmijn says they’re always enthuasiastic and excited. For Jasmijn and Jorrit, working together also means getting to travel the world together. Sometimes family members will join them too – last summer, Jorrit and Jasmijn flew Jasmijn’s mother, brother and sister to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a memorable family vacation. As Jasmijn, now 25, gets further into adulthood, she says she’s also becoming increasingly conscious that getting to spend quality time with her father is a privilege. “I’m aware that it’s very, very special to get to go to many places, just the two of you,” she says. “It’s creating a lot of memories.” “If you have the opportunity to do things like this together, then really just enjoy it as much as you can.” Aviation remains a male dominated profession, and Jasmijn is grateful for her father’s encouragement she expressed an interest in following in his footsteps. She also hopes the tide is changing and the aviation landscape is becoming more diverse. “There are more female pilots,” she says. “I like that a lot.” Jorrit is also keen to encourage anyone – regardless of gender or background – who is passionate about aviation to consider entering the industry. “When she was 10, telling people she wanted to become a pilot, people looked at her and thought, ‘Wow, how cute,’ or ‘How funny,’” he says. “But if you really want to achieve something, and you go for it, it’s possible.” Jorrit is now 55 and approaching compulsory retirement. Right now, he’s also working in a different area of KLM to Jasmijn, so the father daughter pilot team reckon their days flying together are numbered. “I’m going to miss Jasmijn flying with me. But I’ve got nice memories of flying together, which was really, really special,” he says. Plus, Jorrit’s retirement won’t spell the end of family adventures. Jasmijn is currently working to become a first officer, which will mean conducting takeoffs and landings herself. This, she says, will create another day to remember. “One of my dreams is to take my dad on a flight with me so that he can see my landing,” she says.","        6:53 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
149,CNN,The night train revolution has been hailed as an alternative to airplanes. Here’s how that’s going,Unknown,"Night trains have been making a resurgence across Europe after decades of decline, raising the prospect of more sustainable ways of crisscrossing the continent as travelers look to find alternatives to flying. There’s nothing quite like an overnight train. The excitement before an evening departure. The sense of adventure. The cosmopolitan mix of international travelers. And the timeless cultural appeal that inspired “Murder on the Orient Express” and“From Russia With Love”or legendary songs by the likes of James Brown, David Bowie and Ray Charles. And then there’s the journey itself – retiring to bed as you clatter out of a big city and waking up in a new city, or even a new country, can create memories to last a lifetime. At least that’s the theory – and why the new wave of night trains are being touted as one way to replace short or even medium-haul flights across Europe and the US. So how’s that going? Even before their renaissance, night trains could be a pleasant, memorable and sometimes economic way to cover long distances – but luck has always been a big factor. At their best, fares can be good value, combining the cost of a bed for the night and hundreds of miles of travel, but prices quickly ramp up on busy routes, often putting them out of reach for most travelers. Wherever they run, night trains are complicated, labor intensive and expensive to operate – one of the major reasons they went into decline in the first place. Delays are frequently measured in hours rather than minutes, thanks to overnight diversions, while the quality of accommodation has been patchy, ranging from modern and comfortable to basic and outdated. Equally, the novelty soon wears off if you’re trying to sleep in a carriage full of hyperactive teenagers or a bachelor party. No one likes to arrive in a new city at 7 a.m. feeling like they’ve slept on a park bench. Their recent renaissance though, notably in mainland Europe, owes as much to growing environmental concerns as it does to Agatha Christie or James Bond. Spreading quickly from Scandinavia, theflygskam(flight shame) phenomenon is encouraging climate-conscious travelers to seek alternatives to short-haul air travel. Where good rail links exist, long-distance travel between major cities is booming again after the Covid-19 pandemic, and for longer journeys overnight trains can offer a compelling alternative to the unpleasant experience of early morning flights. Led by Austrian Federal Railways’ (ÖBB) “Nightjet” network, overnight links between major European cities have been restored and expanded over the last few years, reversing decades of dwindling services. They will receive another boost in December when luxurious new trains enter operation between Vienna and Hamburg. Featuring comfortable sleeper cabins, discreet “pods” for solo travelers rather than traditional shared couchettes and fully accessible cabins, the 33 new trains are perhaps the most visible sign that night rail trips are back. Rail travel expert Mark Smith, who runs the The Man in Seat 61 website, is impressed with these new developments. “The new trains are very classy indeed,” he says. “In my view ÖBB has got it right, offering a shower and toilet in every single or double-bed cabin whilst offering beds at budget prices in mini cabins where travelers no longer have to share with strangers. “The mini-cabins — a sort of Japanese-style capsule hotel on rails — are the biggest innovation and I think they’ll be a hit with young climate-conscious travelers.” Working with Swiss Federal Railways and Germany’s Deutsche Bahn, ÖBB has reinvigorated overnight routes linking main hubs in Vienna and Zürich with cities in Germany, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and, more recently, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. Its success has encouraged other countries, most notably France, Italy and Sweden, to re-examine overnight operations, revive abandoned routes and even propose new carriages to improve their offering. Italian State Railways (Trenitalia) has just committed to buying 70 new carriages for night trains, featuring high-quality cabins with en suite toilet and shower, some with double beds. The first vehicles will be deployed on the long-distance route from Milan to Sicily, which crosses the Strait of Messina on Europe’s last remaining passenger train ferry. The $770 million contract could eventually see up to 370 new overnight carriages introduced to update Italy’s entire overnight train fleet. In the United States, national passenger operator Amtrak has started the process of replacing more than 800 veteran “Superliner” and “Amfleet” cars on 14 overnight routes, including the world-famous California Zephyr and Coast Starlight. Several private startups have also been inspired to enter the market in Europe, promising new routes, cheaper fares or more luxurious accommodation appealing to different sectors of the travel market. So far, only a handful have made it onto the rails – Sweden’s Snälltågetnow links Stockholm with Denmark and Germany, while Czech travel provider Regiojet operates a handful of overnight routes, including seasonal international trains from Prague to Croatia’s Adriatic coast. An ambitious new player is European Sleeper, which opened its Brussels-Amsterdam-Berlin route in May 2023, providing useful connections with Eurostar for travelers to/from London. However, European Sleeper’s difficulties in securing a suitable train and timings offer sobering lessons for other open-access operators hoping to exploit renewed demand for overnight travel. Originally expected to launch in 2022, the start was delayed by a critical shortage of serviceable coaches. ES eventually managed to assemble a collection of 1970s seated coaches, couchettes and even a venerable 1950s sleeping car built for the legendary Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits (CIWL) – one-time operator of the iconic Orient Express. It’s enough for one train, running three times a week on alternate days in each direction. It hopes to increase the frequency to daily when more rolling stock becomes available. ES’s original intention was to run beyond Berlin to the tourist honeypots of Dresden in eastern Germany and the Czech capital Prague, but a lack of suitable train paths (the timetabled slots allocated to specific trains) means that won’t be possible until March 2024. It’s frustrating for all involved when the trains can sell out weeks before departure and demand outstrips supply on a route that appeals to backpackers and business travelers alike. ES has ambitions to add a new route each year, with Brussels-Copenhagen-Stockholm and Brussels-Barcelona mentioned so far, although the challenges it faces in securing rolling stock authorized for France and Spain and operating through France are likely to be formidable. “The effort required to get new sleeper trains up and running should not be underestimated,” says rail expert Smith. “But ÖBB and start-ups such as European Sleeper are proving that it can be done.” French hopeful Midnight Trainsis also trying to break onto the scene, promising to deliver a luxurious “hotel on wheels” experience between Paris and Barcelona from 2025. Long-term, it plans to serve 10 destinations radiating from Paris. Some will be easier to achieve than others, although none could be regarded as straightforward. While routes to Milan/Venice, Florence/Rome, Hamburg, Berlin and Copenhagen look achievable if sufficient rolling stock can be obtained, Paris to Madrid and Porto will require vehicles with gauge-changing capability to run on rail gauges in Spain and Portugal that are wider than standard European tracks. An even longer shot is Midnight Train’s eyebrow-raising proposal for a Paris-Edinburgh route, which would require new trains built to fit through smaller British tunnels, bridges and platforms and to meet stringent Channel Tunnel fire regulations. A similar plan to run overnight trains between major UK cities and mainland Europe in the mid-1990s – known as Nightstar – never made it beyond the testing stage and the part-finished coaches were eventually sold to Canada’s VIA Rail at a huge loss. Nightstar’s business case was blown apart by the rise of low-cost airlines but following the UK’s Brexit from the European Union, it’s likely the enormous cost and political resistance to establishing international overnight links between the UK and mainland Europe will still far outweigh any benefits they could deliver. UK/EU border control requirements present a huge obstacle for international night trains to the UK, as they did to German plans for Frankfurt-Brussels-London daytime high-speed trains and, more recently, their well-publicized squeeze on Eurostar capacity. Midnight Trains has yet to obtain any suitable vehicles, let alone start the process of refurbishing them to its proposed specification. It is not alone in this respect – all prospective open-access train operators face a huge task in sourcing appropriate “pre-loved” rolling stock. Without government backing – enjoyed by ÖBB and other incumbent state railways – it’s also very difficult to obtain the necessary finance to acquire and approve special new night trains. Nick Brooks, secretary general of ALLRAIL, a pressure group representing non-state train operators, says national rail companies have an unfair advantage that could stymie efforts to expand services. “Politicians must be clear: the night train market will be effectively closed for a very long time,” he says. “This would run contrary to the goals of the single EU Rail market – which is madness when a clear and efficient alternative model already exists. “European Sleeper demonstrates that demand for long-distance cross-border passenger rail, including night trains, is growing fast, and that such services can be operated in a commercially viable open access manner.” One possible solution is for the EU and rolling stock leasing companies to back the procurement of a fleet of special overnight vehicles for lease to any operator. So, what does all this mean for the much-vaunted night train revolution? With the honorable exception of government-subsidized Nightjet, which plans to expand rapidly over the next five years, European night train services have yet to match the hype. Demand is growing, but the enormous difficulties of financing and setting up new operations is suppressing growth. No amount of favorable travel articles will make the operational, political and financial obstacles evaporate, nor do they change the reality that night train fares remain expensive compared to low-cost flights and long-distance buses with dynamic pricing. Taken in isolation, night trains carrying 200-300 passengers per trip do not have the capacity to deliver the required modal shift away from air travel and cars – only high-speed trains can provide that kind of frequency and density on long-distance inter-city routes. However, given the right conditions, with carefully targeted financial and political support, night trains can – and will - play an important niche role on long-distance routes of between 500 and 1,000 miles over coming decades.","        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 12, 2023",12.0,11.0,2023.0
150,CNN,The best Christmas markets taking place around the world in 2023,Unknown,"There’s nothing quite like a festive market to bring out the Christmas spirit in people. While these events can be traced back to Vienna – the city’s first recorded December market was in 1298– the tradition has spread across the world over the centuries. From Germany, to Switzerland, to Singapore, to New York, it’s difficult to find a coveted destination that doesn’t hold an impressive annual advent market. In fact, some have grown so popular, they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right. Here’s our rundown of some of the top Christmas markets that are taking place around the world this year. With reindeer rides, a giant Ferris wheel and a classic nativity scene to marvel at, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically. Although there are around 20 Christmas markets in the Austrian capital to choose from, Wiener Christkindlmarkt, or Rathausplatz, is one of its oldest and most traditional events. Held in front of City Hall, the event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, also features a 150-square-meter children’s ice rink, while the famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a hot favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity. There are also plenty of stallsoffering up tasty treats like Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch. Wiener Christkindlmarktruns from November 10 to December 26. It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland. Most Swiss towns are pretty much taken over by festive markets at this time of year and the atmosphere is incredible. But Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around. Separated into two different sections at Barfusserplatz and Munsterplatz, it’s made up of around over 150 fabulously decorated stalls selling Christmas spices, decorations and candles. Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Munsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star workshop and a festive train. Attendees can also take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for incredible views of the lights illuminating the old town, or sip on some mulled wine at the 13-meter high Christmas pyramid on Barfusserplatz. Basel Christmas Marketopens on November 23 and is scheduled to run until December 23. One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets,Strasbourgbegan back in 1570, but it’s evolved considerably since then. Spread over more than 10 locations, including a section of the UNESCO world heritage site of Grande Île, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling Christmas lights and festive ornaments. Drawing in over two million people a year, the festive market features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine. Place Klebe is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree on display. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares. Strasbourg Christmas Marketbegins on November 24 and closes on December 24. Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market. One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons. A light and sound show, ice skating, and fairground rides are among the activities to enjoy, while visitors can also browse through about 200 or so chalets serving glühwein, Belgian beers and waffles and stare in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree erected in Grand Place. Brussels Winter Wonderswill run from November 24 to December 31. To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is something of an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period. While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day. Old Town Square provides endless entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops, while Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats like klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine. The markets will be open from December 2 to January 6, 2024. Dating back to 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the feast day of Santa Llucia, which falls on December 13, to a three-week fair. Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four different sections. The first is nativity and figurines, where visitors can pick up nativity scene type decorations and figurines. Greenery and plants is packed with both natural and artificial trees and various types of plants. The crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while simbombes is designated for musical instruments. There are also many festive activities like storytelling, a Christmas parade, and the caga tio, an enormous pinata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick. Fira de Santa Lluciawill be taking place from November 24 to December 23. There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica. Although this traditional fair is transported from Heidelberg, Germany to Florence every year, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many Italian treats, such as panforte, for sale. However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies. Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8. I Mercati Natalebegins on November 18 and runs to December 17. It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years. Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight. Think live nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves. Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment. Advent in Zagreb 2023is scheduled to run from December 2 to January 7, 2024. Rumored to be the inspiration for Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year. But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period. With over 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other. The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve. Christmas in Tivoliis taking place from November 19 to December 31. (The park will be closed on December 24). The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets. Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale. On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer. Visitors are also treated to regular performances by dance troupes and choirs. But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441. Tallinn Christmas Market 2023is due to take place from December 1 to January 7, 2024. Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen. Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic. The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner. Visitors can make their own decorations at Christmas workshops, take part in regular craft demonstrations or join in with the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site. Skansen’s Christmas Marketis open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 24 until December 17. This wonderfully Scandinavian Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue. Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies, glogi, Finland’s take on mulled wine, and handicrafts are also a big draw. Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities like Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive, with a host of top eateries to choose from. Tuomaan Markkinatis set to run from December 1 to December 22. Budapest has two main festive markets – St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or Advent Bazilika, and Vorosmarty Square Christmas market. The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts. Meanwhile, the Vorosmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts over 800,000 visitors annually. Its main highlight is usually a giant advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the fantastic Hungarian foods that line its stalls – langos and chimney cake are also particular standouts. The markets will open on November 17 and close on January 1, 2024. Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets. Capital city Berlin has around 80 to choose from, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned. Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with Bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with unique Christmas gifts. At night, visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances. Over in Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stands are erected in the city’s central market square and the whole area is abuzz with activity. The market usually draws in around two million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights. Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 2023kicks off on December 1 and ends on December 24. Gendarmenmarktopens on November 27 and is set to close on December 31. Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital. The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink, which happens to be the largest in the UK. Visitors can also take part in ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus troupe, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar, or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village. Hyde Park Winter Wonderlandis scheduled to open on November 17 and will continue until January 1, 2024 Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe. Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall. Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as kiełbasa (sausage,) shop for handcrafted gifts or treats, while taking in live music from folk bands and carol singers. The market also hosts a nativity competition in which participants, including school children and local artists, create small nativity scenes, or cribs, which are displayed at the statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, situated in the square, before a winner is chosen. Krakow Christmas Marketwill be held from November 24 to January 1, 2024. Now in its 10th year, Singapore’s Christmas Wonderland is continuing to grow in popularity. Staged at the famous Gardens by the Bay nature park, the annual event, which lasts for around four weeks, covers more than 27,000 square meters and is separated into three areas – Supertree Grove, Frosty’s Fairground at The Meadow, and Gingerbread Grove – all packed with attractions. From fairground rides, to a Christmas train, to light and sound shows, to carnival games, to a life-sized gingerbread house lit up by candy canes, to live performances, there’s plenty of activities to choose from. The 20-meter tall Spalliera, a magnificent design inspired by Mesola Castle in north Italy is one of the main highlights, along with the stunning Walk of Lights, which is illuminated by around 75,000 bulbs. Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bayopens on December 1 and closes on January 1, 2024 Formerly known as the Toronto Christmas Market, the Distillery Winter Village is an intimate and charming take on the traditional European festive market. Held in the historic Distillery District, it features outdoor shopping cabins and food vendors, Christmas carol sing-a-longs, a gingerbread hunt and a 50-foot Christmas tree. Visitors will be able to find everything from artisanal food, handcrafted gifts and festive drinks at the numerous stalls here. The Distillery Winter Village 2023will be open daily (other than December 25) from November 16 to the New Year. Each and every year, Manhattan’s Bryant Park is transformed into a magnificent wonderland for the Winter Village. The renowned open-air market is a wonderful sight to behold, with over 150 custom-designed kiosks and a 17,000-square-foot outdoor rink that’s free to use provided you have your own skates. Its rinkside bar and food hall The Lodge provides an eclectic mix of eateries, along with an outdoor beer garden and a cocktail bar. Outside the Winter Village, the Josephine Shaw Lowell Fountain is at its most beautiful during winter time, when it regularly freezes over. The Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Parkopened on October 27 and is scheduled to run until March 3, 2024. First launched in 1996, Christkindlmarket Chicago takes inspiration from the historic Christkindelmarkt in Nuremberg, Germany, bringing a taste of traditional German Christmas markets to the ‘Windy City’. Now staged across three locations around Chicago, Daley Plaza, Gallagher Way at Wrigley Field and River Edge Park in Aurora, the hugely popular market provides live entertainment alongside a multitude of stalls selling everything from bratwurst and hot spiced wine, to hand-crafted ornaments. Admission is free, but those attending the Daley Plaza market who are keen to skip the crowds have the option to purchase a $25 fast-entry pass on weekends.

151,CNN,There’s probably no monster in Loch Ness. But we did find one of its best-kept secrets,Maureen O'Hare,"It’s not the volume of water in Loch Ness that impresses, although that’s substantial. It is, after all, 23 miles long with steep walls that plunge into a 754-foot abyss deep enough to submerge Edinburgh Castle twice over. It’s the unsettling darkness that stands out. Peat washes into the loch from surrounding rivers and streams, creating water as rich a brown as the tea that flows from pots in guesthouses in the nearby village of Drumnadrochit and the Highlands beyond. But it’s cold, bitterly cold, averaging around 40 F (4 or 5 C) year-round. “You could be swimming next to a 400-foot submarine, it would be two feet in front of you, and you would not see it,” says Alan Mc Kenna, social worker by day and, in his free time, founder of the Loch Ness Exploration research group. “It’s like a lost world down there.” Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock in a water-filled valley formed by the shifting of tectonic plates half a billion years ago, you’ll be familiar with Loch Ness and its mysteries. On November 12, it’ll be 90 years since factory worker Hugh Gray took thefirst photographof the Loch Ness “monster.” Earlier that year, in April 1933, hotel manager Aldie Mc Kay set off what would become an international frenzy through her reported shoreside sighting of an enormous, whale-like beast. Countless “monster” sightings, hoaxes, searches and expeditions later, the enigma endures. Mc Kay’s hotel in Drumnadrochit has been turned into the new $1.8 million Loch Ness Centreand last August hundreds of Nessie fans gathered at the loch for the biggest monster hunt in 50 years. The findings, perhaps unsurprisingly, were inconclusive. Even when visiting on a dreary Tuesday afternoon, the steel-gray sky reflecting off the loch’s restless undulations as anorak-clad day-trippers mill from shabby tearoom to souvenir store, Loch Ness is still a fair bit more than the tourist trap of expectation. For many it’s an amusing, perhaps underwhelming, detour on a trip to the Isle of Skye or to Cairngorms National Park. There is, however, genuine eerie lore in these parts, from Irish monk Saint Columba banishing a sea serpent from the River Ness in the sixth century, to English occultist Aleister Crowley’s devilish antics at Boleskine Houseon the loch’s southeast side.The house was later owned by Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, then gutted by fire in 2015, and is now under refurbishment and sporadically open for tours. And that’s not to mention the animated corpses that a hapless local minister is said to have had to return to their graves in Boleskine churchyard in the 17th century. But no legend will ever surpass the monster in the public imagination. Amateur naturalist Adrian Shine, founder of the Loch Ness Project research group, has, since 1973, dedicated a full half-century of his life to scientific exploration of the UK’s largest lake by volume. In recent years he has stepped back from public engagements, but his elegantly white-maned, magnificently bearded figure, somewhere between Rasputin and Santa Claus, is the guide in video form through the center’s new multimedia exhibition. He’s also been an inspiration and mentor to generations of Nessie enthusiasts. That includes people like Mc Kenna, who makes the three-hour trip from Edinburgh each month to lead a volunteer hunt, and Steve Feltham, who’s been living in a caravan beside the loch since 1991. “It’s a really bizarre extended family of Loch Ness enthusiasts,” says Mc Kenna, his love for the project glowing in every word. Having Shine talk him through his Highlands fieldwork “was one of the most amazing experiences ever,” says Mc Kenna. “Give me someone that is so passionate and so motivated to share that with everybody else. It’s phenomenal.” For this is the biggest secret of all. Nessie hunters are not, contrary to popular assumption, fantasists battling against reason and common sense. What we discovered at Loch Ness is a community of naturalists united by a love of environmental science and a joy in life’s boundless mysteries – both terrestrial and existential. Not a person we spoke to is convinced a multi-humped serpent or long-necked plesiosaur splashes in the depths — and yet the devotion to investigation is deep and heart-felt. “There’s a lot of me that believes there is a monster out there,” says Alistair Matheson, skipper of the Loch Ness Project, who takes guests out onsonar-equipped cruises. “What your monster may be differs from person to person. I think for me, there’s a mystery here, and that’s what I firmly believe in.” “If there is something in Loch Ness, it does not play by the rules,” says Mc Kenna. “People are still seeing things that they can’t explain and I think that’s worth looking into. If it turns out these are all caused by natural phenomena, that’s fine. We’re still doing what we love.” For the truth is that this is no ordinary lake. Despite its wintry temperatures, Loch Ness never freezes over due to the thermocline effect, which means cooler water sinks and is replaced by warmer water from below. These shifting layers of water at different temperatures create huge underwater waves, forming a surface current that can carry logs and other debris along against the wind – which can be mistaken for the tail or neck of a creature swimming against the current. Then there are occasional water spouts, whirling columns of mist and air that, when the water is calm and with no way of judging size, can look like the long neck of a thrashing beast. Mc Kenna recalls his encounter with one: “I heard this massive splash off to my right, I didn’t catch the splash on film. But what I did catch afterwards was this huge spray coming off the water.” It was Adrian Shine who burst his bubble and explained its earthly origin. But, says Mc Kenna, “Loch Ness is so fascinating that it can cause these mirages. It’s a bit of a riddle, the whole place.” Those famous Nessie humps, explains Shine by video in the center’s exhibition, are typically caused by boat wakes. When heavy vessels pass through a long, deep and narrow lake such as Loch Ness, it can create a particular phenomenon called a Kelvin wake, whose ripples look remarkably like bumps when viewed from a low angle such as the shoreline. The idea that there might be a dinosaur-type creature living in the loch was discounted many long years ago. A study found there is no reptile DNA in the water and it is simply too cold for such a creature to survive. Mammals would fare better, but in those impenetrably dark waters, plants cannot thrive and it’s a paltry food chain for a growing beastie. The loch is connected to the sea as well as numerous rivers, so one of the most popular theories is that the monster is an animal, such as a seal or a whale, passing through. Then there are the fish theories, says Shine. There’s “sturgeon blundering in from the sea,” but they “wouldn’t find a spawning partner.”Artificially introduced catfish is another suggestion, but the water’s too cold for them to breed. A 2019 study found a substantial amount of eel DNA, bolstering the theory that Nessie is an overgrown eel, but that too has had itsdebunkings. Core samples have been takenfrom the lake bed, with researchers getting a look at 12,000 years of mud, marked by coal burning from the industrial revolution and radiation from atomic testing in the Pacific. A fleet of research vessels swept across the loch in the 1980s, mapping the underwater terrain like a “sonar curtain,” says Matheson, “cutting edge technology back then.” Echo sounding allows Matheson to track the depth of the loch on his boat outings, while hydrophones – underwater microphones - are Mc Kenna’s best friends. “If you don’t have a submarine, if you don’t have an underwater drone, you’re very, very limited,” he explains. “What really helps us is our hydrophone. We don’t have eyes down there, but we’ve certainly got ears.” The monster quest that drew crowds from around the world this August is set to return, says Mc Kenna and the team at the Loch Ness Centre, with hopes of it perhaps becoming an annual event, with increased investment in research and technology. Until then, the Loch Ness Exploration group meets monthly on the loch and is free and open to everyone — believers, sceptics and agnostics alike: details are on the public Facebook page. The monster’s existence has never been proved, but it can’t be disproved either. And it’s that exquisite leap of faith that keeps believers going. That’s the secret of Loch Ness. Meeting on the shores one sleepy afternoon as the clouds meander above, the grass ripples on the living hills and the peat-brown waters lap quietly below, visitors may find out a little about our world, and a lot about ourselves.","        2:00 PM EST, Sat November 11, 2023",11.0,11.0,2023.0
152,CNN,This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good,Unknown,"The pandemic’s enforced period of no travel led an American couple to rethink their life and retire to sunny southern Italy. Seventysomethings Glenda and Randy Tuminello from Spokane, Washington, retired in December 2022 to Polignano a Mare, a dazzling white, cliffside town in the Puglia region, renowned for its stunning beaches and turquoise waters. The pandemic outbreak, they say, forced them to reconsider longterm life projects, and look for a tax-friendly spot where they could make the most of their Italian dream. “We had originally planned [pre-Covid-19] to go spend a year in Italy, celebrating retirement. But then Covid struck and during those two ‘no travel’ years we began to rethink our original plans,” Glenda Tuminello, a, a former high school math teacher and home designer, tells CNN Travel. “We decided to sell our home, our car and all superfluous possessions and make Italy our retirement home for good. We chose beautiful Polignano a Mare, it offered a flat tax rate of 7%” – introduced by the government to lure foreign retirees. Other plus points were the town’s fantastic historic center, friendly residents, and coastal location with unique gorgeous views – as well as the very affordable lifestyle on offer. “We don’t need a car here. It’s just a few minutes’ walk to the train station that could take us anywhere we want to go in Italy, as well as any European country that we want to visit,” she says. The couple have made new friends, including other American residents, and adore Polignano’s festive vibe with celebrations and music always going on in the picturesque piazzas. “Locals bring their lawn chairs out at night to the promenade area by the Adriatic to sit out and talk, visit, laugh into the late hours of the night. It is so lovely, so upbeat, so family-oriented. We never ever feel anything but safe here – [there’s] never a threat of danger walking the beautiful streets at night,” she says. Randy Tuminello, a former consulting manager in architecture, had a further ancestry lure: his grandparents migrated to the US from the Sicilian fishing village of Cefalù in the early 1900s, settling in Louisiana. “My roots have been a huge factor in picking Italy, it’s like coming home, and we feel more at home here than we ever felt in the US. Then again my wife is an Italian at heart and loves everything Italian,” he says. The couple looked at different southern Italian regions offering a 7% flat tax for new immigrant retirees, before picking Puglia. The house they rent, located in Polignano’s historic center, costs $1,200 a month. They saw the ad online and it was love at first sight. The home was perfect – right down to the finest detail. It came partly furnished, including the tableware. “We were going to buy it at first, but now with the economy unsure, it was best to rent,” says Randy Tuminello. “It was a decision made at the right time as rentals are now skyrocketing, and homes on sale are quite expensive as there are few and most are taken as B&Bs.” The two-bedroom house has an office, spacious dining room, balcony, front porch with a little garden, and another covered terrace area where the Tuminellos enjoy morning coffee. It’s a typical white stone home tucked in a picturesque winding alley, with an arched portal entrance, vaulted ceilings, terracotta floors and thick walls dotted with jutting-out rocks. Randy Tuminello says their “overriding desire” to relocate to Polignano a Mare came from their preference for Italian culture over American. “The materialistic aspect is not as predominant in Polignano as in the US, and there’s more a sense of community – of family and friends,” he says. Even though they’ve left behind at home kids and grandkids, the couple says their new life is comfy and lacks nothing. All they have to do is to make sure they have a good time every single day – as if they were on holiday. Going out for dinner and evening walks along the promenade overlooking the Adriatic are their preferred activities. Despite living on the coast, the pair aren’t beachgoers. Despite spending nearly a year in Polignano, they have yet to go to the town’s little beach, which is enclosed by cliffs like a fjord, nor had the pleasure of a nice dip in the translucent sea – which the Tuminellos prefer to admire from afar. But southern Italy’s charm comes with challenges – like when they had to fix the air conditioner one sultry summer day. The unexpected rising temperatures in southern Italy are too much even for Louisiana natives. This past summer the heat kept them from moving around and carrying out daily plans – they had to go out early in morning when it was still bearable. And they miss some American foods, like barbecue sauce, peanut butter and lemon curd – though they’ve found a place in Polignano where they can get some US condiments. The language barrier is an issue, too. Glenda Tuminello thinks they need to learn Italian to show respect to locals. As it is, when they go to the grocery to buy pecorino cheese, they always fear they’re not asking for the right amount, ending up with too much or too little. They also get lost in translation at the yogurt store. One positive that the Tuminellos have noted are the incredible driving skills of southern Italians who always “stop on a dime.” Glenda Tuminello says moving to Italy was simply “one of those no-brainers that you better pounce on while you can!” That’s because the couple was supported throughout the entire relocation process and by Finding La Dolce Vita, an Italy-based firm that assists would-be expats. “There is a great amount of work that goes into the legal preparations in Italy if you want to actually live there,” says Glenda Tuminello. The pair applied for the elective residence visa, which requires a passive income of 38,000 euros ($40,700) per couple. There were plenty of hoops to jump through. “It took almost one year to complete all the required background paperwork needed. We wanted to get it right the first time,” she says.","        9:52 AM EST, Mon November 13, 2023",13.0,11.0,2023.0
153,CNN,The untouched skiing paradise on the edge of Europe,Unknown,"Peering out of the plane window, he spotted the priceless “white gold.” Towering, snow-laden peaks stretching for miles on the southern edge of the Black Sea. It was as if he could see his future. He knew he’d have to take a closer look. Swiss mountain guide Thierry Gasser was on his way home from a heli-skiing trip in Kyrgyzstan in 2001, when from his seat he saw the familiar Caucasus mountains to the north and an intriguing chain of shining peaks to the south. Gazing through “perfect blue skies,” Gasser was looking at the Kaçkar range in northeast Turkey. “The first look from the plane was perfect, they were huge mountains and a large mountain range – that was the green light for us to go there and check every valley and every mountain,” Gasser tells CNN Travel. He was already on the lookout for a destination in which to set up his own heli-ski business after years of working around the world as a guide for other operators. He had only three criteria: proximity to Europe to avoid jet lag, a big, high-altitude mountain range, and – ideally – a coastal location for higher snow quantities and a more stable snowpack. Gasser had spent plenty of time guiding clients in the Russian Caucasus, as well as in Uzbekistan, India, Canada, Alaska and across Europe. A new frontier for heli-skiing was also on the list. Poring over the maps, Gasser and Italian guiding friend Danilo Garin realised that the 75-mile (121 kilometer) chain of the Kaçkar range, near Turkey’s border with Georgia, seemed to tick all the boxes. In the summer of 2002, Gasser spent a month on the ground in the area, hiking the valleys, assessing the local facilities and flying over the mountains – the highest of which is Kaçkar Dagi at over 13,000 feet (3,962 meters). “The shape of the mountains is perfect for heli-skiing,” says Gasser, who is based in Verbier during winter. “In every valley it’s possible to do more than 50 runs if you want and it’s very close to the base – less than five minutes flying. For the guests, it’s perfect.” He zeroed in on the small resort of Ayder, a traditional “yayla” or summer highland pasture village, with wooden pitch-roof houses and barns, surrounded by pine forests and waterfalls. The village – in a lush, narrow valley carved by the Firtina river – is popular in summer with regional tourists and visitors from the Middle East with activities such as hot springs, rafting and hiking. In winter, moist air from the Black Sea mixes with cold mountain air to produce plentiful powder snow at altitude from January to April. “It’s just epic skiing,” says Oliver Evans of Elemental Adventure, a London-based heli-skiing agency which organizes trips for small groups and private clients to more than a dozen exotic mountain locations worldwide. “You just don’t realize you’ve got this Canadian-style heli-skiing right on the doorstep of Europe. “You’ve got these little villages up there which are abandoned in the wintertime with deep snow on the roofs, and mosques. It’s quite exotic to wake up in the morning and hear the call to prayer going on outside the hotel. It’s the last place you expect to be skiing.” Gasser ran his first trips from Ayder in 2005 with one helicopter, rented from Air Zermatt in Switzerland. “They opened the road and opened one hotel just for us,” said Gasser. “We were alone in this village. Now at the weekend plenty of people come there to see the snow, to play in the snow with sledges or with tubing, light a fire or have a barbecue on the snow, with singing and dancing. But when we started, nobody was there in the winter.” Bureaucracy forced Gasser to shut down the operation after a few years, but he remained eager to return and was able to reopen in 2018, with exclusive access to a nearly 2,000 square mile tenure – enough to fit in a large chunk of the French Alps and some of Italy – reserved for about 20 skiers per week. In January 2023, with snow in the European Alps thin on the ground and expectations low, Evans flew out to Istanbul and then made the short hop to local airport Rize, just an hour’s drive from Ayder, to run a trip for clients. Trabzon is another regional airport option, two hours’ drive away. The first day, he says, it was “absolutely dumping.” He took some clients up through the forest in a snowcat to do some avalanche rescue training and assess their ability, skiing back down to the village via a tiny trackside café for a cup of local Turkish tea. “You’re skiing past, and all these people are looking at you like you’ve come from Mars, they’re not particularly familiar with seeing people skiing there,” says Evans. The following morning the weather had cleared and Evans, one of the clients, and guides Georg and Yann clambered into the helicopter sitting right outside their hotel base, the three-star Hasimoglu in Ayder. Swiss pilot Dany eased the machine above the frosted trees and out of the valley, opening up a dazzling vista of pristine peaks with the Black Sea glimmering to the north. Minutes later he dropped them at the top of a slope nicknamed Home Run. “It was a bluebird, not a cloud in the sky, cold, 70-80 centimeters [28-31 inches] of new snow on the base. Just unbelievable,” says Evans. They waited for the storm of the blades and the wop-wop-wop sound of the heli to disappear. There was a moment’s silence to savor the beckoning slopes beneath them before the guides calmly outlined the plan. None of the frenzy of a resort powder day up here. “My first turns of the winter and it was thigh-to-waist, light, proper cold-smoke powder,” says Evans. “The client and I were both giggling like school kids, we just could not believe our luck to have scored it this big on the first day of the season. You could tell even the guides were thinking that this was off the charts. “There was a lot of whooping and high-fiving going on, it was pretty American. In the first hour and a half I probably skied more untracked powder than I had in the last 10 years.” After a morning dancing through feathers, they touched down on a ridge for lunch and munched on sandwiches, hot soup, chocolate, fruit and nuts, plus tea, coffee and drinks from the helicopter cool box. “We were outside this little deserted village with snow folding over the roofs of these little shepherd huts, and the minaret of the mosque just to remind you that you’re in Turkey and not British Columbia,” says Evans. “It was probably my best day’s skiing ever.” The average run in Ayder is about 900 vertical meters (nearly 3,000 feet) and clients can expect to ski about about 11-15 runs per day. Professionalism and safety are paramount, and the guides are constantly monitoring the avalanche risk. “There is a misconception about heli-skiing that it’s quite extreme but on the whole, it isn’t,” says Evans. “You’re not jumping out of helicopters; you’re stepping out of them very carefully, slowly and deliberately. There is a saying, ‘slow is fast’. There are a few women doing it but there’s no reason there couldn’t be more.” Apres ski at the Hasimoglu, which was refurbished in 2016, is generally low key.Guests relax in spring-fed hot baths, sip Turkish coffee or drinks from the bar, play table tennis or visit the on-site masseurs. Dinner is buffet style with plenty of salads, humus, pitta, falafel, kofte, aubergine, tomatoes and grilled meats. Local specialities includehamsi kusu, a dish of Black Sea anchovies, ormuhlama, made of corn flour, butter and cheese. Gasser’s rotating line-up of guides come from all corners of the globe: Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, USA. With the local Turkish staff, it makes for a cosmopolitan mix. “The Turkish people are very nice, welcoming, very open, they help us a lot, it’s a big pleasure to work with them,” he says. On bad weather days, alternative activities include skiing from the snowcat, snow shoeing or ski touring. Guests can visit a tea plantation, honey-makers and craft centers, or relax in local restaurants. When famed American snowboarder Jeremy Jones was a guest, some of the locals revealed they had been riding around the village for more than 60 years on old wooden boards, with rope handles and a stick to steer. “Maybe snowboarding started there, in a small village in the Kaçkar mountains, not in the USA,” laughs Gasser.  “It’s a great story.” Progress is in the air in Ayder, and the Turkish government is exploring projects to develop a proper resort with ski lifts. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who hails from Rize, even visited the region in 2020 to promote winter tourism. The Kaçkar mountains could soon be on the world ski map, and not just for heli-skiing. “We will be very happy if, one day, there is a ski resort in Ayder,” says Gasser.","        8:38 AM EST, Fri November 10, 2023",10.0,11.0,2023.0
154,CNN,Georgi Paleykov/Nur Photo/Getty Images,Amanda Davies,"Dimitar Berbatov’s successfulsoccercareer took him to top-flight leagues in Germany, England, France, Greece and India, scoring more than 250 goals and winning 10 trophies. But his latest endeavor could be his biggest challenge to date. Four years after calling time on his playing career, Berbatov has grand ambitions of reshaping the football landscape in his native Bulgaria. He says that it’s neither status nor power that motivate him, rather a desire to impart his accumulated knowledge and experience from playing at the top of the sport in Europe. “Bulgarian football is in major crisis,” Berbatov tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies from London in a recent interview. “My team –Stiliyan Petrov, Martin Petrov, all former football players – decided that we need to change something back home. And we started to fight for that change.” But change has so far proved elusive, especially – the former Manchester United player says – while the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) and current president Borislav Mihaylov remain dogged by a series of controversies. Mihaylov resigned as president of the BFU in 2019 after England players said that they experienced racist abusewhile playing against Bulgaria in Sofia; according to the union, Mihaylov’s resignation was a “consequence” of “an environment which is damaging to Bulgarian football.” Prior to the game between Bulgaria and England, Mihaylov had said that it was “offensive” and “derogatory” for England’s players and manager Gareth Southgate to suggest that they could face racist abuse. Then Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for Mihaylov to resign after the match, saying that it was unacceptable for people from Bulgaria “to be associated with racism and xenophobia.” Mihaylov denied that Borissov’s remarks were linked to his resignation, according to The Guardian, saying at the time: “There were four or five people making the chants … We did what we had to do regarding the security during the game versus England. “Bulgaria is not a racist country. And my decision to step down has nothing to do with Prime Minister [Boyko] Borissov asking for my resignation the day after the game. My patience is over.” What happened in 2019 wasn’t the only racism scandal to tarnish the BFU’s leadership. Earlier this year, technical director Georgi Ivanov said that non-Bulgarian players of “other skin color” wouldn’t play for the national team during his time in the role. He later defended his comments following backlash, according to Balkan Insight. Two years after submitting his resignation, Mihaylov stood again and was re-elected as BFU president for a fifth term when Berbatov was also a candidate. However, Berbatov argues that Mihaylov won power unfairly. Prior to the election in 2021, the speaker of congress announced that a total of 242 votes were needed to win the BFU extraordinary congress, but Mihaylov went on to win just 241 votes and was subsequently certified by congress to be the winner. Berbatov then immediately told the media following the congress that he would be challenging the ruling and, soon after, launched a lawsuit in a Sofia court from which he is still awaiting a verdict. In the voting, 241 voted for Mihaylov, 230 for Berbatov, eight for a third candidate, and four did not vote. “I’ve been beaten in my professional career, scored goals, missed goals, lost battles,” Berbatov says. “When it was done the right way, you have nothing to say. But when it’s done the wrong way, you need to signal everyone to see what is going on.” The congress ultimately ruled after the voting that 241 votes was enough for victory, a decision that Berbatov’s court case seeks to challenge. “The Bulgarian law still recognizes the undisputed victory of Mr. Borislav Mihaylov as president in front of high-ranking FIFA and UEFA officials who also formally stated that the congress was of the highest organizational standards and its outcome should be respected in full,” the BFU told CNN Sport in a statement. It added: “The president and the governing body of the Bulgarian Football Union were rightfully elected and are recognized by all stakeholders as such – and the fact that Mr. Berbatov continues to proclaim himself presidential candidate is absurd considering that there are no presidential elections scheduled.” Mihaylov, a former goalkeeper who captained Bulgaria to the semifinals of the 1994 World Cup, has been president of the country’s football union since 2005, barring the two-year hiatus after he resigned from the role. However, there is a growing sense of discontent over Mihaylov’s leadership among soccer fans in Bulgaria, and that came to a head on Thursday when supporters clashed with police during Bulgaria’s European Championship qualifying match against Hungary in Sofia. The protests were against the BFU’s executive board amid a poor run of results from the men’s national team. Some of those attending the protests held signs and wore t-shirts denouncing Mihaylov’s leadership. There had already been controversy surrounding Thursday’s game after it was moved from Sofia to Plovdiv then back to the Bulgarian capital with days’ notice. The switch was reportedly due to construction work at Plovdiv’s Hristo Botev Stadium. The initial change of venue had been requested because of a security risk regarding fan protests; the game was eventually played behind closed doors due to “an elevated risk of public disorder,” UEFA said. The Hungarian Football Federation voiced frustration at the game being relocated at such short notice and fans being unable to attend, describing the decision as “unprecedented, completely unjustified, and severely unsportsmanlike.” Its statementadded: “It is not even possible to organize a family holiday in this way, let alone an international football match with a huge stake that affects many people and millions are interested in.” The game ended 2-2 as Bulgaria remains bottom of its European qualifying group having failed to win any of its seven games. “It’s obvious that the system is not working because, since 2005 until the present day, we have failed to qualify for any major tournament as a nation,” says Berbatov. “And that shows you how football back home is ruled. When the national team is the face of the federation and when the national team has no major tournaments to go and play, it’s signaling that football back home is not governed the right way.” Bulgaria last qualified for a major international tournament at Euro 2004, when a squad featuring Berbatov lost all three of its games. The nation hasn’t appeared at the World Cup since 1998. Berbatov is arguably Bulgarian soccer’s most famous export since the turn of the century, best known for his skillful ball control and strong scoring record at top clubs across Europe. He is also a hugely popular figure with fans, particularly in Bulgaria, and says that his vision for the sport is “completely different” compared with those currently governing the federation in his home country. He has been living and working in Bulgaria since retiring from soccer. “Football is suffering and no major talent can go out and play in big leagues,” Berbatov says. “There is no infrastructure back home, no stadiums. The kids are training in poor conditions.” The BFU acknowledged that most stadiums in Bulgaria, while being renovated, are in “poor condition,” but told CNN that this is a consequence of neglect from club owners and the government’s “lack of involvement” in the sport. Berbatov says that he and his team have toured the country three times, presenting their vision of how they would govern the sport to the clubs in Bulgaria. “We are frozen in time,” he adds. “We are still in ‘94. And we think this is how things should be done. No, it’s 2023. Things are completely different in football and this is what I want to show the people back home.” As he awaits a decision from the court regarding the 2021 congress, Berbatov is also pressing soccer’s authorities to investigate the circumstances under which Mihaylov was able to win the election. He says that Aleksander Čeferin, the president of European soccer governing body UEFA, was “very concerned” about the situation when the pair spoke in the past, while world governing body FIFA, he says, is yet to answer his team’s requests. CNN Sport asked UEFA about Berbatov’s apparent conversation with Čeferin but did not receive a response. “Isn’t it the job of FIFA and UEFA as governing bodies to constantly be everywhere in the federations and see the red flags and work to be sure – not to act after the incident – but prevent incidents like this happening?” says Berbatov. FIFA did not respond to CNN Sport’s request for comment, but in a statement, UEFA said that it has “never expressed any concern regarding the election process in BFU.” It added: “We can confirm that UEFA has received a file containing numerous documents pertaining to the matter from Mr Berbatov. Our administration has thoroughly examined these documents but has not found anything suspicious or untoward. “Finally, there is an ongoing legal case before the national court involving two candidates. UEFA will monitor the case’s progress and be attentive to the outcome.” Berbatov says that he remains committed to his task, confident that he is the man to bring positive change to Bulgarian soccer. “We will succeed, there is no doubting that,” he adds. “It’s going to take a while and it’s taken now two years of back and forth, back and forth. “This is not the thing that I love to do, but that I am forced to do. Hopefully, FIFA and UEFA, they will wake up and try to investigate.”","        11:46 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
155,CNN,The new film ‘Blindsided’ challenges the blockbuster’s take on the life of ex-NFL star Michael Oher,Unknown,"Many are familiar with former NFL lineman Michael Oher’s story as told in the acclaimed book and blockbuster film, “The Blind Side.” The CNN Flash Doc, “Blindsided,” exposes the truth behind the Hollywood spin on Oher’s story and premieres this Thursday, November 16 on Max. A new CNN documentary releasing on Thursday sheds light on the strained, complex relationship between former NFL player Michael Oherand the Tuohy family. Oher’s life and his time living with Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, a wealthy White family from Memphis, Tennessee, was the subject of a book and the 2009 blockbuster, “The Blind Side.” The Oscar-winning movie charts the former offensive lineman’s rise from homelessness and poverty to becoming a star football player at college and in the NFL with the help of the Tuohy family. But “Blindsided” paints a different picture of Oher’s upbringing, challenging the film’s depiction of him as unsophisticated, uneducated and solely reliant on the family’s support for his success. “It’s kind of embarrassing, and I’m embarrassed for him as a friend,” Quinterio Franklin, one of the Super Bowl winner’s former classmates, says in the CNN documentary after watching a scene from the movie in which Oher submits a test without answering any of the questions, instead drawing a stick figure on a boat. “It’s not accurate and it’s hurtful.” Anthony Burrow, Oher’s former caregiver, agrees. “He’s very smart, he’s capable,” Burrow says in the documentary. “In the movie, it depicted a totally different person.” Oher went to high school at Briarcrest Christian School in Eads, east of Memphis, and after his junior year started staying with the Tuohys and accompanying the family on shopping trips. This narrative is captured in “The Blind Side,” which followed a 2006 book of the same name by Michael Lewis. The film proved a hugely popular rags-to-riches tale, reportedly making more than $330 million and earning Sandra Bullock an Oscar for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy. But the veracity of some of the scenes has been questioned. At one point, for example, the Tuohy’s young son, SJ, is seen explaining basic rules of football to Oher by using bottles of sauce as a stand-in for players. “I’m sorry about the part that I played in adding to his discomfort in the role that he watched,” Quinton Aaron, who played Oher in “The Blind Side,” says in the documentary after reflecting on the rule-explaining scene. “But in Hollywood, you have to think about the audience that you want to shop and market this to.” Oher has previously said that the film “took away the hard work and the dedication that I curated,” adding that he disliked his portrayal as someone who couldn’t read or write. “When you go into a locker room and your teammates don’t think that you can learn a playbook, that weighs heavy,” Ohertold The Jim Rome Show earlier this year. In August, Oher filed a petition in a Tennessee court to end hisconservatorshipwith the Tuohys, which he claimed had kept millions of dollars from him, including his share of the film proceedings. In the petition, he said that the Tuohys had told him that they were going to adopt him. A conservatorship is a legal arrangement enabling a court-appointed person to make financial, medical and/or other decisions on behalf of another adult. It is typically implemented in situations when an adult is considered unable to make decisions for themselves, whether from a serious mental illness, a disability or other debilitating conditions. A Tennessee judge terminated the Tuohy’s conservatorship over Oher in September. A Tuohy family court filing from this month detailed that Oher, and later his son, were paid more than $138,000 from “The Blind Side” book and movie between 2007 and April of this year. Oher has until November 28 to file any objections to the Tuohy’s document. “The Tuohy’s have never received any money as conservators on behalf of Michael Oher and further never had control over any funds or any dealings on behalf of Mr. Oher during the entire term of the conservatorship,” the filing said. In a separate court filing from September, the Tuohys said that they “vehemently deny” telling Oher that they “intended to legally adopt him” and always acted in his “best interest.” This was after Oher, in his petition to end his conservatorship, and his attorneys said that the Tuohys had taken advantage of “a gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited for their own benefit.” Speaking in the “Blindsided” documentary, Joseph Crone, one of Oher’s Briarcrest teammates, says that the Tuohy family claiming they had never intended to legally adopt Oher “is contrary to what has been voiced during the last 20 years.” Meanwhile, Nate Hale, Oher’s foster brother, explains how, growing up in foster care, hearing someone say “adopted” is “the greatest feeling in the world when you feel like you have nobody.” “To hear people who you felt had your best interests say we never intended to [adopt],” Hale adds, “in my opinion, that’s betrayal.” In August, attorneys for the Tuohys said that the family doesn’t “need” Oher’s money, adding that “Mr. Tuohy sold his company for $220 million.” Oher declined to be interviewed for the CNN documentary, citing pending litigation, while the Tuohy family also declined an interview. Oher played eight seasons and started 110 games in the NFL. He won the Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in 2013 and went on to play for the Tennessee Titans and the Carolina Panthers before retiring in 2017 aged 30.","        2:55 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
156,CNN,Everton deducted 10 points for breaching English Premier League rules,Unknown,"Everton FChas been handed an immediate 10-point deduction by an independent commission for breaching the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs), the English Premier League announced on Friday. The deduction means that Everton drops to 19th in the league table, level on points with last-placed Burnley. Prior to the sanction, the club was 14th in the table having accumulated 14 points from its opening 12 games of the season. “The Premier League issued a complaint against the Club and referred the case to an independent Commission earlier this year. During the proceedings, the Club admitted it was in breach of the PSRs for the period ending Season 2021/22 but the extent of the breach remained in dispute,” the Premier League said in its statement. “Following a five-day hearing last month, the Commission determined that Everton FC’s PSR Calculation for the relevant period resulted in a loss of £124.5 million, as contended by the Premier League, which exceeded the threshold of £105 million permitted under the PSRs. “The Commission concluded that a sporting sanction in the form of a 10-point deduction should be imposed. That sanction has immediate effect.” Responding to the points deduction, Everton said that it is “both shocked and disappointed” by the decision, adding that the club will be launching an immediate appeal. “The Club believes that the Commission has imposed a wholly disproportionate and unjust sporting sanction,” Everton said in a statement. It added: “Everton maintains that it has been open and transparent in the information it has provided to the Premier League and that it has always respected the integrity of the process. “The Club does not recognize the finding that it failed to act with the utmost good faith and it does not understand this to have been an allegation made by the Premier League during the course of proceedings. “Both the harshness and severity of the sanction imposed by the Commission are neither a fair nor a reasonable reflection of the evidence submitted,” added Everton in its statement. Everton’s next Premier League match is at home to Manchester United on November 26 following the conclusion of the men’s international break. The Merseyside club narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League last season after finishing 17th, two points above the relegation zone. Commenting on the points deduction, UK lawmaker Caroline Dinenage said that the decision was “deeply disappointing for Everton fans, and for everyone who wants to see the English game thrive in a fair and sustainable way.” She also called for an independent regulator to be put in place to oversee football governance in England.","        9:48 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
157,CNN,Luis Díaz inspires Colombia to emotional victory as his father watches from stands after kidnap release,Unknown,"Luis Díazscored two goals to help Colombia stun Brazil in a World Cup qualifier on Thursday, as his father watched on from the stands just a week after beingreleased by kidnappers. Luis Manuel Díaz looked overcome with emotion as he witnessed his son net an impressive second-half brace to fire Colombia to a 2-1 win inside packed Estadio Metropolitano. On October 28, Díaz Sr. was abducted along with his wife, Cilenis Marulanda, by ELN gunmen in his hometown of Barrancas, northeastern Colombia. Marulanda was rescued later that day, but Díaz Sr. was handed over just under two weeks later to a mixed commission of UN personnel and Catholic priests on Thursday in nearby city Valledupar. He was reunited with his son earlier this week, ahead of Thursday’s match in Barranquilla, Colombia. Gabriel Martinelli had given Brazil an early lead in the game, but Díaz responded with two goals in four second-half minutes. The first came in the 75th minute, with Díaz directing his header into the bottom corner of the net as a cross found its way to the Liverpool star. While the forward celebrated the equaliser, television footage showed his emotional father, wearing in a Colombia shirt, cheering along. Just moments later and the pair were celebrating again. Díaz timed his run brilliantly again and leapt above a Brazilian defender to score another header past his Liverpool teammate and Brazil goalkeeper Allison in the 79th minute. The stadium erupted with the goal, as Díaz jumped over the advertising boards to be closer to the fans. Footage once again showed Díaz Sr. passionately celebrating with tears in his eyes. “I’m grateful to my teammates, to the coaching staff who were always there for me at every moment,” Díaz said, according to BBC Sport. “And I dedicate the victory to the people, who deserved it.” It was a cathartic evening for the Díaz family, but another bad one for Brazil, which has now lost its second consecutive World Cup qualifier match. The five-time World Cup champion has now slipped to fifth in the qualifyingstandings, with Colombia up to third. Elsewhere, Argentina suffered a 2-0 loss to Uruguay on Thursday in its World Cup qualifier – the first time the world champion has been beaten since losing to Saudi Arabiain the World Cup group stages last year. Goals from Ronald Araújo and Darwin Núnez were enough for Uruguay, with Lionel Messi unable to inspire his lacklustre side. The Ballon d’Or winnerdid come close to scoring though, hitting the crossbar with a freekick in the second half. “We never felt comfortable, didn’t find a way to end up with the ball or the control of the actions, were not able to have long possessions, didn’t create chances and played the game that they wanted, in their rhythm,” Messi told Ty C Sports, per Reuters. “They are a physical team that bring a lot of danger in the counter-attacks and they showed that with the goals they scored.” Argentina remains top of the qualifying standings with 12 points, with Uruguay now just two points behind in second. There are 18 rounds in South America’s World Cup qualifying system, with the top six teams progressing to the 2026 event while the seventh-placed country will go into the FIFA play-off tournament, which will involve six countries from other continents.","        11:41 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
158,CNN,"From breaking records to Le Bron James shoutouts, meet Puka Nacua, the ‘special’ rookie wide receiver",Unknown,"In Canton, Ohio, between the busts of the legendary figures of the sport – from Super Bowl winning quarterbacks to era-defining coaches – stands a blue and gold jersey with the No. 17 on the back. The name on the back might be unfamiliar to many, but even after just a few games in the NFL, Puka Nacua has already earned his spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nacua’s jersey has been placed in football’s shrine to all things great and good because of the historic beginning to his rookie NFL season. Drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the fifth round of this year’s draft to relatively little fanfare, Nacua is exceeding expectations with a series of explosive performances. Following Week 5 of the 2023 season – a game in which he caught seven passes for 71 yards and a touchdown – the 22-year-old’s jersey was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the numerous records he had broken. The headline was that he had recorded the most receptions (46) and receiving yards (572) by a rookie in their first five games. At his current pace, Nacua will obliterate the receiving record set by a first-year player in the NFL, set by Jaylen Waddle just a few years ago, as the Rams wide receiver seemingly every week sets a new milestone for the most receptions by a player in their first year as a professional. And for this unheralded player from Utah, it makes the achievement that much more special. Football has always been around Nacua. He has three older brothers, all of whom played at Brigham Young University (BYU) at some point. So when it came to transferring to his hometown university after a few disappointing years at the University of Washington – battling a broken foot and limited playing time from the bench –it was a no-brainer for Nacua. Fesi Sitake, the wide receiver coach and passing game coordinator at BYU, vividly remembers the first time he encountered Nacua. “I remember the first game I watched of him in high school. I saw him make one of the best catches he’s had in his high school career and he’s had a lot of them,” Sitake told CNN Sport. “‘Holy cow, this guy’s special.’ And as we developed the relationship in recruiting, I could tell that what you saw on the surface is who he really was, which was just a super happy, delightful, appreciating life, loves football, great personality type of young man.” Once Nacau had returned home to Utah, Sitake remembers his dedication to learning and improving at BYU, explaining how he was naturally extremely intelligent at his position and also physically gifted, while remaining a warm person too. Sitake describes Nacua’s physical gifts as being like a “gazelle on one play and a Clydesdale the next play” – a Clydesdaleis a powerful breed of horse originating in Scotland where it was predominately used for agricultural means. Paired with quarterback Jaren Hall – also drafted in the fifth round of this year’s draft to the Minnesota Vikings – Nacua blossomed into a dynamic offensive weapon, his physical traits making him stand out while his catching ability developed. In the 21 games he played at BYU, Nacua caught 91 passes for 1,430 yards and 11 touchdowns,including finishing seven gameswith more than 100 receiving yards. He led the Cougars in both statistics in his two years at the university, despite dealing with injuries at the end of his final year. More than his ability to pile up statistics was Nacau’s uncanny skill at coming up with the big catches at the biggest moments. Sitake highlights BYU’s clash with Boise State last year as a moment which encapsulates Nacua’s abilities as a player and a person. BYU trailed with under a minute remaining, but Nacua was able to make a game-winning, acrobatic catch. Not only did it clinch the victory, it also helped end a four-game losing streak which Sitake described as being like a “little dark cloud that was over our program.” “To feel the electricity on a sideline, to see the relief on our sideline, get the monkey off our backs, so to speak, to see Puka just elated. And it wasn’t for himself because he knew how much we wanted it, how much we were going through it as a team,” Sitake remembers. “I just remember putting my arm around him and just having a great talk with him and saying: ‘That’s who you are, man. Like, when someone needs something, they go to you. And this is just going to be a small sample right here of how your life is going to be.’ “And then we end up finishing the season with four straight wins, and Puka was the catalyst to that … through the dark four-game stretch, he was just putting his head down. “He was still smiling, he was still laughing, was still working hard. He never changed according to the environment around him and it ended up paying off.” The 177th overall pick in the NFL draft isn’t usually followed with much interest, given it comes midway through the third day of proceedings. But when the Rams submitted their selection with the final pick of the fifth round, little did they know that they’d completely revamped their receiving corps with just one selection. An already high-ceiling group, which included Cooper Kupp – the NFL’s receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns leader in 2021 – was searching for additional explosiveness. Last season, Kupp had suffered a catastrophic knee injury and the drop off between him and the rest of the receiving group was stark as the Rams endured a tough Super Bowl title defense, going from 12-5 in 2021 to 5-12 in 2022. In Nacua, they got a contributor from day one. He might have fallen down in teams’ draft predictions due to his injury history in college, but the Rams decided to take a risk and add him to the squad. In fact, theofficial NFL scouting reporton Nacua coming out of BYU predicted he would be taken in the sixth or seventh round of the draft, also saying that he is “lacking the twitch or speed to attack NFL man coverage at a successful rate.” The scouting report also said he would “struggle to elude NFL press coverage” and “lacks instant acceleration to separate” from defensive players. Sitake recalls texting Nacua after finding out his new home, with the two expressing their excitement at Nacua being able to be coached by Sean Mc Vay and paired up with Kupp. Sitake had played alongside and coached Kupp during his time at Eastern Washington. With Kupp out for the first four weeks of the season, Nacua flourished in the limelight, totaling 25 receptions and 266 receiving yards through the first two weeks of the season. “It was a dream come true. It couldn’t be any better,” Nacau told reporters after the Rams’ Week 1 victory in Seattle against the Seahawks. “I had a ton of fun out there.” In those two weeks alone, Nacua broke three NFL rookie records – his 25 receptions broke the previous record of receptions by a rookie through their first two games of 19 set by Earl Cooper in 1980; 25 receptions were also the highest ever for a rookie in any two-week span, surpassing Odell Beckham Jr.’s record of 23 in 2014. Nacua also became the first rookie in history to record 10-plus catches and 100-plus receiving yards in each of his first two games. Rams head coach Mc Vay has seen his fair share of efficient offenses. He might only be 37, but Mc Vay has been credited in part with bringing about an offensive revolution to the league after his appointment to his current role in 2017. So when Mc Vay effusively praises a player, it’s probably worth sitting up and listening. “He’s a stud. The game makes sense to him, physically and mentally tough,” Mc Vay said after the Rams’ Week 2 loss to the San Francisco 49ers when asked about Nacua. “Works really hard. “I think even when you guys talked to him last week, he’s very inquisitive. He asked a lot of questions and he’s got great guys to be able to lean on, whether that’s (Rams receivers coach) Eric Yarber, but really, you know, you look at the veterans in that receiver room with Cooper (Kupp), I think Tutu’s (Atwell) done an excellent job. “And Van (Jefferson), his rapport with Matthew (Stafford) where they’re able to bounce things off of one another, I think that’s been a real positive and Puka is going to continue to improve and I love Puka.” But Nacua had only just gotten started. A further 72 yards came in Week 3 before a monster nine-catch, 163-yard performance against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 4 where Nacua scored his first NFL touchdown – which just so happened to be the overtime game-winner for the Rams. A clip of Nacua’s girlfriend, Hallie Aiono, celebrating the moment – sitting almost disbelievingly as tears roll down her face – wassharedby the official NFL Instagram account and had over 266,000 likes, showing the growing interest in the Rams rookie. Praise for Nacua reached its zenith that week when arguably the best basketball player of all time, Le Bron James, shouted out his performances, calling him ‘Puka Dončić’ – a reference to the Dallas Mavericks superstar guard, who is prone to creating magic on the court – on a live stream on social media. Week 5 marked the return of Kupp which saw the majority of targets go the way of the 30-year-old star. But that hasn’t stop Nacua from racking up monster statistics. Over the next five weeks of the season, Nacua compiled 326 receiving yards off 25 catches and a touchdown. As a rookie, he sits in the top five in the NFL in terms of receiving yards (827), as well as touting 64 catches to his name, breaking Kupp’s previous single-season franchise record of 62 set back in 2017. Nacua has 293 more receiving yards than the next rookie in the league, Jordan Addison. Nacua has given the Rams’ receiving corps one of the most-feared duos around and his poise defies someone playing his first year in the NFL. “There’s always naturally going to be an element of surprise, not in the way that you didn’t think he could be successful, but that he’s on the track at such an early age,” Sitake told CNN. “And I think that’s just a credit to a lot of factors: the right fit, the organization, Puka himself, the work he’s put in, his supporting cast around him, his family and friends and the people that love him. “It’s just created this perfect recipe to have the season he’s having right now. Whatever that results in terms of records broken or not, man, I’m just so happy for him, and I truly believe no one’s more deserving to be on the track that they’re on right now than Puka.”","        8:50 AM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
159,CNN,Miha Azne/Frank Vasquez/BACKGRID,Jacqui Palumbo,"Kate Beckinsale wore a bejeweled mini dress over the weekend to celebrate Leonardo Di Caprio’s 49th birthday in Los Angeles, and a photograph of the black frock, which featured a colossal blue-gemstone-like accessory belted around her waist, has since made its rounds across the Internet. Though the look seems to be a delightful reference to a famous Di Caprio film, one question has persisted: Which one? Is the gem a blue diamond or blue sapphire? The former, of course, might be a nod to the one of the most famous pieces of jewelry in movie history — the fictional heart-shaped blue diamond from 1997’s “Titanic,” worn by theotherimportant Kate in Di Caprio’s life. But, being that the Heart of the Ocean is well, heart-shaped, a second possible inspiration for the look is a piece of jewelry with more direct significance to Beckinsale. In her co-starring role as Ava Gardner in “The Aviator,” Beckinsale declares to Howard Hughes, played by Di Caprio, that she’s “not for sale,” when he woos her a square-cut blue sapphire necklace. Whichever fictional gemstone Beckinsale made larger-than-life, the statement piece was surprisingly not a custom look for the event, but straight from The Blonds Fall-Winter 2023 collection, which showed during New York Fashion Week in February. Inspired by films such as “Valley of the Dolls” and the jewelry worn by stars like Elizabeth Taylor, the collection — by designer Phillipe Blond and creative director David Blond — was an exuberant, campy celebration of Hollywood glamour, bursting with sculptural corsets, velvet gowns and sequined party dresses that included oversized gemstone motifs. For her night out, Beckinsale paired the ultra-mini with black tights — a near continuation of thepantsless trend, as the runway version of her look was presented slightly shorter as a top — sky-high reflective platform heels and a big black hair bow. Other attendees to the Beverly Hills fête included Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Salma Hayek, Kim Kardashian, Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum, according to Harper’s Bazaar. But no one else seemed to celebrate the occasion with such a chic sartorial easter egg, leaving Beckinsale’s look a dazzling win for the night.","        3:44 PM EST, Tue November 14, 2023",14.0,11.0,2023.0
160,CNN,Russian artist receives seven-year sentence for anti-war protest,Unknown,"Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko, who had replaced price tags with anti-war messages in a St. Petersburg grocery storeas an act of protest, was sentenced to seven years in jail by a court in the Russian city on Thursday. According to the court’s press service, Skochilenko was found guilty of “public dissemination of deliberately false informationabout the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” The prosecution claimed that in March last year, Skochilenko “placed paper fragments containing deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in places for attaching commodity price tags” in a chain supermarket in St. Petersburg. Despite Skochilenko pleading not guilty to the charge and the defense seeking acquittal, the court imposed a seven-year sentence with a three-year ban on activities related to using “electronic or information and telecommunication networks,” the press service said in a Telegram post. Skochilenko has been kept in pretrial detention since April 2022, a period of time in which her health has been deteriorating, according to the independent investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta. In her last statement in court prior to the announcement of the verdict on Thursday, Skochilenko questioned the perceived threat posed by her actions, stating, “How little faith does our prosecutor have in our state and society if he believes that our statehood and public safety can be destroyed by five small pieces of paper?” Describing herself as a pacifist, Skochilenko said she did not understand the purpose of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. “Today, scientists and doctors around the world are fighting to increase human life expectancy and find cures for deadly diseases. Therefore, I don’t understand: what is (this) war for? War shortens lives. War is death,” she added, according to a courtroom correspondent for the independent news outlet Mediazona. Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, Marie Struthers, condemned the conviction. In a statement, Struthers decried the “manifestly unjust verdict,” highlighting that Skochilenko had been “arbitrarily deprived of her freedom and held in torturous conditions for 19 months.” Skochilenko “was simply trying to expose … Russian aggression against the people of Ukraine,” Struthers continued. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war.”","        9:47 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
161,CNN,A Dutch designer is knitting jumpers from human hair,Unknown,"A wooly coat and a head of human hair have more in common than you think; not only do they help retain body heat, they’re both made from keratin protein fibers. Now, a Dutch startup is questioning why one is worn and the other wasted. Human Material Loophopes to transform the fashion industry by turning human hair into a textile. So far, it has made prototypes of human hair coats, jumpers, and blazers — with the hope that one day, clothing companies will buy rolls of its alternative material for their own designs. Co-founder Zsofia Kollar says she has long been fascinated by hair’s potential as a fabric﻿. She was intrigued by the emotions people harbor towards it—“How much we care about our hair, but once it’s cut, we are so disgusted by it,” she said. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Kollar had an identity crisis as a designer and decided to rectify the hair industry’s waste issue. Every minute, salons in the US and Canada produce877 pounds of waste. When hair breaks down without the presence of oxygen, like in a garbage bag buried in a landfill, itreleases greenhouse gasesthat contribute to climate change. According to Human Material Loop, 72 million kilograms of human hair waste end up in European landfills every year, the equivalent in weight of seven Eiffel Towers. “It’s a big abundant waste stream that currently has no scalable solution,” Kollar said. She adds that most countries burn this waste, and that many alternative solutions are not environmentally friendly or aren’t suitable to be widely used. Kollar explains that using the hair fabric is not that different from knitting a sweater with any other material. Short hairs are spun together and transformed into a continuous thread to make a yarn, and then dyed with pure pigments. She added that as the company scales up production it may dye the yarn or fabric, depending on which is most efficient. Human Material Loop’s first prototype was a sweater with a wool-like feel. “I needed to make a product that people can relate to, and the jumper was one of the most feasible prototypes we could make, but also the most relatable,” Kollar said. Since then, the company has tested other prototypes, including an outdoor coat stuffed with hair to provide thermal insulation, which it tried out in harsh conditions during an expedition to Aconcagua, the highest mountain in Argentina. These designs aren’t available to buy — the aim is instead to supply the material for other designers and brands to work with. Kollar says the price should be competitive with wool once it reaches a bigger production volume. “We do know that to wear human hair on our bodies, it’s not something that most people are ready [for] yet,” Kollar said. But she believes the idea could grow on the public. For Kollar, it’s not simply about wearing a jumper made from human hair for the novelty or sustainability aspect; she argues that human hair is an incredibly durable material. Human Material Loop sources its hair from salons in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, using hair that is cut or broken off because it says that does not contain nuclear DNA that could identify an individual. It is working on establishing a documentation chain to trace where its material comes from and where it goes. Historically, human hair has been used as a textile in many different cultures. In Micronesia, the Kiribati tribecreated woven armor made from natural materials including coconut fibers, shark teeth, palm leaves and human hair, while in the 13th century, people in what is now the Southwestern United States craftedsocksby knotting together strands of hair. Kyoto’s Higashi Hongan-ji Templeis one of the world’s largest wooden structures. After a fire damaged it, ropes made from human hair donated from across Japan were mixed with hemp and used during its reconstruction in the 19th century. But using hair as a textile isn’t without challenges, explains Sanne Visser, a Dutch material researcher, designer and maker, and associate lecturer at the University of the Arts London, who isn’t involved with Human Material Loop. “There’s still a taboo around human hair as a material,” she said. “We don’t value it really as a resource — it’s seen as waste, especially once it’s cut off.” In her “Locally Grown” project for London’s Design Museum, Visser worked with hairdressers and imagined a future where hair becomes a valuable resource, coining the term “hair farming.” She also redesigned the barber’s chair so it could catch cut hair – saving time for the hairdresser, and the recycler. Visser says ultimately the implementation of human hair in our products isn’t simple. “There is much more work to do to get people’s heads around into accepting it as a material,” she said, but added, “I can definitely see it coming more into our daily lives, with time.”","        5:30 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
162,CNN,Most expensive Ferrari ever auctioned fetches $51.7M,Unknown,"A 1962Ferrari 250 GTOhas sold for $51.705 million, becoming the most expensive car from the Italian manufacturer ever sold at auction. The record-breaking sale took place at Sotheby’s in New York on Monday as the car was offered publicly for the first time in 38 years. Gord Duff, RM Sotheby’s Global Head of Auctions, said the sale “highlights the unparalleled sta﻿ture of this Ferrari as one of the world’s most desirable objects.” “This transaction adds a new chapter to a vehicle with an unmatched legacy,” Duff said in a press release. “Now, it ranks among the most expensive cars sold at auction, a true testament to its singular place in history,” he added. Only 39 examples of the 250 GTO were built by the legendary Italian marque between 1962 and 1964, and it’s extremely rare for an owner to part with one at any price. This example, chassis number 3765, is one of only 34 built with Tipo 1962 coachwork, and the only one of these raced by the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, featuring in races such as the Le Mans 24 Hours. “Claiming unique build provenance and a remarkable in-period racing pedigree, this spectacular GTO is among the model’s most singular examples,” the auction house wrote in the listing, which billed the sale as “an extraordinary chance to acquire the Holy Grail of the sports car pantheon, one that should be relished for the opportunity it is.” Its rarity means it has featured in several Ferrari-focused magazines over the decades, and Sotheby’s suggests that “the public availability of such a singular GTO may never repeat itself within our lifetime.” While 3765 is now the most expensive Ferrari ever to sell at auction, another 250 GTO holds the record for most expensive Ferrari ever sold. Renowned car collector David Mac Neil, founder and CEO of automotive floor-mat company Weather Tech, bought chassis number 4153 GT for $70 million in 2018. At the time, James Knight, group motoring chairman at UK auction house Bonhams, likened 250 GTOs to some of the most exclusive artworks in the world. “The Ferrari 250 GTO is the motoring market’s equivalent of Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’ and a talisman for any top-end collection,” said Knight. “And the GTO that recently sold is one of the best five extant.","        10:39 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
163,CNN,Look of the Week: ‘Succession’ star Brian Cox is no longer dressing for the boardroom,Unknown,"In the five years Brian Cox played vitriolic media mogul Logan Roy in HBO’s boardroom drama “Succession,” viewers mostly saw him on-screen in a navy business suit and burgundy tie. But since the show concluded in May 2023, the Scottish thespian — now 77 — and his stylist Venk Modur have been cultivating a more, well, experimental look. (HBO and CNN share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery). Cox has leant into his “retirement” (at least from the role of Waystar Royco CEO) with loud,florid chintz-printed jackets by independent designer Jasmine Chongo; a firetruck red suede Lowry jacket and matching auburn shades; and now, appearing on the Jimmy Fallon show last Tuesday, a striking pair of faux leather pants that scream — or likely squeak — leisure. His high-shine trousers were made by Budapest-based label Nanushka, offset with a navy pinstripe shirt and a preppy pair of tricolor horsebit loafers from streetwear brand Kith. The slick, camel-colored bottoms were decidedly more flattering when Cox was upright rather than seated, upon which they looked unfortunately flesh-like. The trousers, if seen by Cox’s youngest fictional son, would almost certainly elicit the Roman Roy-ism: “If I cringe any harder I might become a fossil.” Not many understood the vision. “Chap has clearly completely lost his mind,” wrote one X user.  “I wish this app would stop showing me Brian Cox in those leather trousers and loafers,” added another. But Cox is “always down to be the best,” wrote Modur on his Instagram. And he’s not the first man to don a pair of skin-tight leather-look ankle grazers. Freddie Mercury’s high-waisted leather breeches (in black and red) became his unofficial performance uniform during the 1980s, while David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison and even Elvis Presely have been known to talcum-up and tug on a pair. More recently, Joe Jonas has been praised online for his rotating selection of leather pants in red, brown, black and silver during the latest Jonas Brothers tour. There are fewer rules in menswear today than ever before. Once upon a time, even forgoing a tie was considered borderline negligence. “Ever since the Middle Ages, powerful men in the West have covered their throats,” fashion historian Anne Hollander wrote in 2000 in the New York Times— somewhat horrified after seeing the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, then one of the most highly valued corporations in America, at a press conference both in open-neck button-downs. Lo and behold, two decades on, everyone’s favorite faux-CEO is bearing his calves — and more besides — in leather trousers on prime-time television. Fashion is a fickle mistress indeed.","        9:57 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
164,CNN,"Prince’s iconic white, ruffled ‘Purple Rain’ shirt is up for sale",Unknown,"A signature white, ruffled shirt once owned by Princeis expected to fetch thousands of dollars in an onlineauctionthis week. The soft, silk garment, which he wore during his performance of “Purple Rain” at the 12th Annual American Music Awards in 1985, is one of a huge collection of items from the late singer’s colorful wardrobe. The Fashion of Prince auction, staged online by US firm RR Auction, comprises 203 items amassed by a French collector, identified only as Bertrand on the company’s website. According to RR Auction, the seller bought the memorabilia directly from designers who worked closely with Prince, as well as from other auction houses. His plan had been to set up a museum dedicated to the rock star, who died in 2016 after overdosing on fentanyl. Prince starred in the movie “Purple Rain,” which was released in 1984. As well as the title song, the soundtrack contained the future hits “When Doves Cry” and “Let’s Go Crazy.” He won two Grammys for it the following year, as well as the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Well known for his lavish wardrobe, Prince wore this style of ruffled white shirt – complete with faux-pearl buttons and shoulder pads – during his “Purple Rain” tour. He performed 98 shows across North America between November 1984 and the following April and wore this particular version of the white shirt during his performance at the 12th Annual American Music Awards. Though in good condition, the shirt displays some signs of wear, including “dimpling to fabric on the wrists and some staining to the right sleeve,” according to the auctioneers. On the website, they say the seller acquired the garment “directly from a designer” who worked on the “Purple Rain” movie and subsequent tour. The shirt, which has so far attracted $15,000 in bids, and the many other items in the collection were on display at a preview event at New York City’s Hotel Chelsea on November 8, including clothing, jewelry, accessories, shoes and guitars. Other highlights from the sale include gem-encrusted brooches worn by the singer during the tour and the round-rimmed sunglasses he wore during his “Sign o’ the Times” era. In avideo interviewcarried out by the Associated Press and published on the auction house’s website, the company’s executive vice president, Bobby Livingston, described Prince as a “revolutionary figure.” “What makes this Prince collection so special is our consignor personally curated this sale in order to tell the story of Prince through fashion,” Livingston said. There has been considerable interest in the auction, which is expected to close on Friday, according to Livingston, who added: “Prince passed away so suddenly and it was such a tragedy. People that love Prince, they are mourning still. They’re emotionally connected to Prince and so they really really want to have something that he actually wore or designed.”","        6:48 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
165,CNN,Drazen Zigic/i Stockphoto/Getty Images,Unknown,"My wife and I were recently invited to Thanksgiving dinner at the home of a friend. At the bottom of the invitation, printed in bold letters, were the words, “No Politics Discussed.” I read those words with a deep feeling of relief. “No Politics Discussed” would — as the hosts no doubt intended — foreclose any heated, unresolvable arguments about the war raging in Israel and Gaza, a topic already dividing families and severing friendships. I found myself wishing that the “No Politics” rule applied more often in our daily discourse, at this moment of fierce strife and rancor. Nearly everyone is confronted by intensely emotional conflicts, with the upheaval roiling workplaces, college campuses, schools and other places. Arguments over Israel are nothing new, but the rifts are deeper and more lacerating than I can ever remember. In one particularly painful and personal case, a dear friend and I have disagreed for decades about antisemitism and Israel. Somehow our friendship always survived — until now. Those earlier conversations were fraught, but the twin horrors of the Hamas attacks and abductions and Israel’s military response on the Palestinians have frayed our bonds of friendship beyond the breaking point. She is a staunch supporter of Israel and finds my empathy for both peoples anathema. In the past, whenever she was stricken over the latest antisemitic threat or assault, I reverted to simply saying, “I love you,” hoping my care might soothe her terror when discussion was impossible. After the attacks in Israel, I listened in silence for a half-hour, biting my tongue. She stormedwhile we walked one day not long ago, so upset that she nearly ran, as she vented over what she called theabandonment of Jewsby groups they’d been allied with over decades of social struggles. Before we parted, I reached out to give a hug, which she stiffly accepted. “I’m sorry I can’t be the ally you want me to be,” I said. “I’m sorry I’m the friend who rants,” she answered. She later upbraided my “betrayal” however, for not giving full-throated public support to Israel. She wrote in an email that it was impossible to continue our two-decade-long friendship. Her words cut deep, for she and her family have been among my closest friends. In Jewish families especially, the generational differences can be stark. The Holocaust, so recent in my childhood, recedes into the distant past of young people, almost the same way that I think of the Civil War. At 21, as an avid folk dancer with one-quarter Jewish heritage, I joined an Israeli dance troupe. Dressed in matching outfits, the other members of our group and Ikicked up our heels at synagogues and public venues. I was glad that Jews had found a safe home and fantasized moving to a kibbutz, where I’d dance and sing while I joyfully swung my hoe, breaking ground in this new land. So far, that safe home has failed to materialize: Each side blames the other and competing claims to one land persist. A negotiated reconciliation — unfathomably hard work, to be sure — appears to be the only resolution. Getting there will be a challenge of gargantuan proportions. But South Africa, for instance, despite its unimaginable cruelties, has managed to make progress — even if conditions remain far from ideal. Other countries mired in endless conflict have made advances as well. None are perfect, yet much preferable to blood running in the street. As a sage person once observed, “There are no sides on a round planet.” The Israeli-Gaza conflict, so brutal, makes this clearer by the day. Only later did I learn more about Israel’s founding and come to understand that the land was not entirely new. Arab Palestinians were long established there, living alongside Jews. Once I learned that, I became an early advocate of a two-state solution. Different generations experience the war differently. Today’s young adults, who have grown up aware of many oppressions in a way we older folks weren’t, have known about the Israeli occupation and Palestinian refugee camps their whole lives. One Jewish friend has an adult daughter who is passionately pro-Palestinian. The mother anticipates uncomfortable Thanksgiving conversations, but is prepared to listen. She believes her daughter will listen to her too, and that their strong bond will prevent a fracture. It will be hard on Thanksgiving Day, despite my host’s instructions, to keep the war, so raw with suffering, from surfacing among the multicultural, politically engaged folks at the dinner table. If the topic does bubble up, as close to the surface as it is for all of us, I hope we will listen to each other in a spirit of empathy. At this terribly difficult time, empathy is a balm that may ease our collective anguish. It doesn’t make the war go away, but may show a path to resolution when peaceful settlement appears impossible. Great leaders like Nelson Mandela, who practiced something extraordinary — forgiveness, even of his jailers — showed us one example. This type of forgiveness, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described it, is necessary to bring about healing in the Middle East. I hold out hope that my dear friend — a loyal and generous woman who has repeatedly helped my family in times of need — will someday allow my sustained love to penetrate the armor she finds necessary now. I imagine reuniting with her one day, mending both our broken hearts. After all, if she and I can’t heal our rupture, how can two beleaguered peoples heal theirs? I suspect that the talk around some holiday tables this year will be rancorous, but some will seek healing. Love may find a way, if not to move mountains, at least to allow space for durable resolutions. Peace is never easy. But it’s not as hard as war.","        11:40 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
166,CNN,"Megan Fox, the actress-turned-poet, has a lot to say",Unknown,"Years ago, I was browsing New York’s Union Square Barnes and Noble when I came across James Franco’s poetry collection, “Directing Herbert White.” I was a struggling English Ph D student at the time, and so annoyed by Franco’sprogram-hoppingthat I moved the books to the True Crime section. Because it was a crime that he wrote them. Get it? Of course, this dumb protest did nothing but create work for the Barnes and Noble employee who had to re-shelve them (I’m sorry). Today, I still have disdain for Franco but because ofthe sexual misconduct allegations against himnot because he wrote poetry (Franco maintains all sexual encounters were consensual). But I am thinking about the phenomenon of the celebrity poetry collection differently — and it has to do with the actress Megan Fox’s recent debut collection, “Pretty Boys Are Poisonous” (Simon & Schuster). Celebrity poetryis a strange animal. There’s really no point in writing a review or providing a value judgment. It’s hard to get angry about their existence unless you’re delusional about the economics of publishing. These books just exist. Fans will be pleased. Skeptics will be mad,like this commenterwho was distressed that someone like Fox could get a book deal with a Big Five publisher: “Poetry is dead…there is no reason that this bimbo should get published over real poets who actually care about the craft. Simon and Schuster has lost all credibility…” Fox, who has starred in “Transformers,” “Jennifer’s Body” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” is, of course, not the first celebrity to write a poetry collection.Jewel,Tupac Shakur,Billy Corgan,Alicia Keys,Mary Lambert,Florence Welch,Halseyand Lana del Rey, among others, have all penned and published poetry with varying degrees of commercial success. From a cursory scan, it seems musicians tend to dip into poetry more than actors — most likely because writing lyrics is similar to writing verse. When a celebrity wants to tell their story or set the record straight, they usuallyturn to memoir or autobiography. Poetry, on the other hand, obfuscates. It gives the illusion of intimacy in a way that no other medium does. Many celebrities build their brand on the illusion of relatability. Fox was always stupendouslynot relatable— too beautiful, too cryptic. She’d make movies then disappear. Saysomething controversialthen vanish. Drop little enigmatic crumbs leading to a gorgeous, vaguely menacing, but ultimately inscrutable cottage in the woods. In an article for NBC, Jude Ellison Sady Doyle ruminated on how Fox’s “unlikability” meant she got left behind when the #Me Too movement was beginning to reckon with abuses in Hollywood. “It would have been easier to honor Fox’s stories, maybe, if she’d framed herself as a devastated victim. But she told her stories the way she told all the others: with confidence, as jokes,” Doyle writes. The same is true of her poetry. Her poems are about victimization but also hint at what happens when a mannequin defies expectation and goes mad. “Like every woman / they refuse to listen to my words / instead / they criticize the shape of my mouth / as I speak them” reads one poem titled “i didn’t sign up to compete in your bulls–t beauty pageant.” In the book’s introduction, Fox says this book is about making the personal political, the singular collective: “And from me poured these poems featuring previously unspoken feelings of isolation, torment, self-harm, desperation, longing, restlessness, rage, and general anguish. These are the experiences of many of us that I now give voice to in these poems.” Fox reflected on her poetic influences inan interview with People: “[The poetry] comes from a lot of places. Some of it is literal, while other parts are allegorical.” Whether or not she’s aware of the confessional tradition she’s writing in, she can thank other women for paving the way. Confessional poetrycontinues to be a debatable term in academic circles. It specifically refers to a small group of American poets operating between the late 1950s and 1970s. It is used more broadly to categorize any poems that appear to be super personal — the first person “I” is used and topics address the horrors of everyday life like mental illness, abuse, physical pain, trauma, addiction, relationship problems, parenting and grief. Confessional poetry is genre that is not limited to women but seems to be associated most frequently with them. In particular, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton are often invoked when confessional poetry is discussed. Both Sexton and Plath used their experiences as women to fuel their poetry. They transformed the stuff of their lives into art that criticized a culture seeking to limit them. For example, in Plath’s poem “The Applicant” (1962) she writes about how the cult of domesticity turns women into literal dolls: “It can sew, it can cook,/it can talk, talk, talk.” The woman in the poem has ceased to be human, reduced to an object without an inner life. “It” is a collection of performances: household work and small, mindless chatter. Since confessional poetry evoked femininity and womanhood, and in some cases, pregnancy and motherhood — and eventually became linked with Second Wave Feminismin the 1970s — certain criticsmocked or dismissedit as something to be embarrassed by. Depending on who you ask, it still is. Poetry and its reception have come a long way from when Plath and Sexton were writing. Now, there are Instagram poets and people who argue about whether Instagram poetsare good or bad. There are Sad Girlsand Plath Girls and poetry tote bags and tattoos. At a promotionalreading in New York City, the majority-female audience wanted to ask Fox things like what she would tell her younger self. There were tears. But there is still a lot of misogyny to contend with when women write about taboo themes, such how patriarchal structures continue to erase or minimize women’s pain and suffering. The violence of abuse and the pain of miscarriage are two of Fox’s most visceral subjects; in these poems, the male figures inflict physical, emotional and sexual trauma on a speaker who dreams of freedom and is trying to discover her own power: “you fall asleep on top of me so that i can’t / call my family or the police” from the poem “oxycodone and tequila” is one of the strongest lines, horrific in its simplicity. There are references to patriarchal violence throughout: the Biblical oppression of Lilith and Eve, the suffering of Mary Magdalene, the sorrow of children’s book “The Giving Tree,” toxic masculinity satire “American Psycho,” Marilyn Monroe (need more be said) and the mythological Persephone, who became queen of the Underworld after Hades abducted her from her mother. Formally, most of the words are written in lower-case, like a whisper. And many of the poems seem to be explicitly intended for meme-ification. The shortest ones, often single sentences, seem primed for Instagram posts. And while sharing poetry on social media or being an Instagram poet isn’t new, it is meaningful to participate intentionally in this tradition, to encourage the consumption of poetry on social media. “Some poems…serve the same purpose as memes in online culture,” Fox explained in an interview. Fox’s poetry matters because women and their stories matter. No matter how often we are told that we need to listen to women, the prevailing message is always that women should shut up. Just last month, rapper Timbalandsaid that Justin Timberlake needed to “put a muzzle” on Britney Spears in light of hermemoir’s recent publication(Timbaland has since apologized for the comment). Where Fox would be the muse for other artists, she is now a creator and a muse for her own art. Her body, famous subject of the male gaze, becomes a poetic body that is the site of multiple traumas, struggling to speak and make meaning. One recent criticdescribed the authorityasserted by confessional poets in this way: “What makes them powerful is that they foreground the experiences of a firmly female speaker, everyday observations that so many women share but are often seen as not valuable or worthy of being called art.” Fox is working within that tradition. These are feminist poems, and they carry Fox’s message: reject silence.","        11:21 AM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
167,CNN,Expelling Santos wouldn’t solve the problem,Julian Zelizer,"A damningreport by the House Ethics Committeeseems to have done what criminal indictments could not: bring the turbulent saga of Republican Rep. George Santos of New York to the conclusion an increasing number of observers have been hoping for. He has announcedhe will not seek reelectionnext year. While this seemingly interminable drama has at last come to a head, the hard truth here is that at this point, Santos’ exit hardly matters, at least when weighed against the reality of the party he’s leaving behind. The report details “substantial evidence” that one of the nation’s most famous liars had violated federal laws. The committee was in unanimous agreement that they would send the material to the Department of Justice. Although the committee did not make any recommendations, the evidence could be enough to finally obtain the support of two-thirds of the lower chamber needed to support expelling him from office. If he were to be expelled, he would be the only member in US history to meet that fatewho has notbeen convicted of a crime or fought for the Confederacy. At the same time that he announced he would not run for reelection for a second term, since “my family deserves better than to be under the gun from the press all the time,” Santos made sure totell supporters on X(formerly Twitter) that the report was a “disgusting politicized smear that shows the depths of how low our federal government has sunk. Everyone who participated in this grave miscarriage of Justice should all be ashamed of themselves.” Santos seems to have learned from former President Donald Trump that when in trouble, the response is to try to discredit everyone who has exposed the problem. The report doesn’t come as much of a surprise. It only adds to the long list of news stories that have uncovered how much of what Santos told voters was not true. Hefabricated a record, a whole fake life really, to become one of the handful of Long Island Republicans who helped swing control of the House from the Democrats to the GOP. In an age where lying and misinformation has become a normalized part of national politics, many observers rightly wondered if there would be any accountability. Given that Republicans can’t afford to lose any seats because of their slim hold on power, a number of House Republicans determined that protecting Santos took priority over any kind of punishment (though both Democrats and Republicansultimately called for his resignation). Given the evidence that has been presented by the Ethics Committee, the odds have increased that the indictment could turn into a conviction, and this is more than most Republicans are willing to swallow. Putting morals aside, many legislators in the GOP can see that this would be a good story to deal with as they try to protect their majority going into 2024. Nor does Santos have the same kind of standing and support as Trump. Today, the odds became pretty good that enough Republicans might join Democrats in voting to expel Santos. Indeed, New York Republicans arecalling for his expulsion: The Ethics report “is in alignment with my long held belief that this fraudster,”said Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, “has no place serving in the People’s House and I once again call on my colleagues to join me in advocating for George Santos’ expulsion from Congress.” Now that Santos is on his way out, the most pressing concern is what, if anything, the nation can learn about improving the state of American politics. While it would be tempting to cheer the outcome as evidence that the system is working, and that the truth still has a place in national politics, that would be an overly optimistic interpretation of events. The Santos story, as dramatic as it has been, is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that has allowed US democracy to descend into a morass of disinformation and falsehood. In certain respects, Santos stepping aside — before being ejected or convicted — allows the GOP to sidestep the question of what has happened to their party. Santos may be bowing out, but Trump is still their 2024 presidential frontrunner. Four indictments aside, as well as numerous civil suits, Trump remains popular and enormously powerful despite a fact-checking record so long that it should find a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Santos choosing not to run again does nothing to curtail or ameliorate a massive and toxic conservative media eco-system — from cable television to social media — that is virtually filter-less and allows all kind of lies, such as election denialism, to circulate at the speed of sound. It does nothing to change the hearts and minds of an electorate that seems so dug into its partisan outlook that anyone can say anything and as long as they don’t threaten the party nobody will touch them. Like Trump, Santos is a symptom, not the cause of what has been happening to the Republican Party. Eliminating him from the caucus will not solve the problem at the core of the party. Trump remains front and center as he continues to spread lies about the election that he lost. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has been constantly throwing out egregious falsehoods such as saying on CBS “60 Minutes” that Democrats are pedophiles.Lying in the GOPhas become a national pastime. Santos’s story is only relevant in that it took so long for him to fall. The fact that he lasted until now, and that there was a serious chance he could survive the kind of record that makes Jon Lovitz’s Saturday Night Live character Tommy Flanagan— that’s the ticket — look honest is remarkable. Lovitz portrayed a pathological liar who ended his elaborate lies by saying “that’s the ticket.” When Santos attacked Lovitz after he came back to play the congressman, the comedianposted on social media: “Thanks the review and advice! You’re right! I do need to step my game up! My pathological liar character can’t hold a candle to you!” It took the serious possibility of federal crimes and expulsion to finally shake him. Now it wouldn’t be completely surprising to see him reemerge as a commentator on Fox News. A healthy political party wouldn’t allow this behavior to thrive. Santos’s downfall should be a moment for Republicans to engage in some introspection, rather than celebration, to think about how they reached this point.","        4:56 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
168,CNN,Travis Kelce is happy to be Mr. Taylor Swift,Unknown,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are the couple of the hour. The pop star and the football player are young, gorgeous, at the top of their respective games and seemingly in the throes of an intense new love. They’re also a surprisingly positive relationship model for men and women alike. Swift needs no introduction: She’s a singer, songwriter and performer who boasts a string of brokenrecords: highest-grossing tour of all time; most number-one albums by a female artist; most-attended concert by a female artist. Her “Eras” tour has been aphenomenon— a must-see for thousands of girls (and some boys) around the world, and projected to rake in billions. Kelce needs a little more explanation for those of us who aren’t football enthusiasts. He’s a 34-year-old tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs,scoring touchdowns in two Super Bowlsthe Chiefs won. He also co-hosts a podcast with his brother Jason, who plays center for the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce, in other words, is a star in his own world. But Swift is a superstar the world over. In a moment of what feels like peak male insecurity, the Taylor-Travis relationship is a useful model: two ambitious adults, both excellent at what they do, but the female half of the couple is both more successful and a higher earner, by a huge margin — and the male half seems totally fine with that. Finding love isn’t always easy for American women in a more feminist world, even as American women have become far better off. Thanks to immense social changes brought about by a combination of feminist activism, reliable contraception and the right to a safe and legal abortion (that last bit was good while it lasted), American women have been on a steady rise since the 1950s. Age of first marriage hasgone upwhile birth rates havegone down, which means American women and girls are far less likely than in past decades to be teenage brides or mothers before they are ready. Women haveoutnumbered menon college campuses for the last several decades, and record numbers of women nowwork outside the home. This has all been wonderful for women and families, and for men, too, who can enjoy the benefits of healthier, wealthier and freer friends, wives, sisters, mothers and daughters. Women, to borrow from Gloria Steinem, are becoming the men they once wanted to marry. Unfortunately, though, a startling number of men see women’s successes as a threat. The husband-as-breadwinner nuclear family model has been on a rapid decline, butnearly halfof Americans still say that men prefer to out-earn their wives. Studies have found that men becomestressed and uncomfortablewhen their wives out-earn them, and that men feelemasculatedby intelligent and successful women. Perhaps as a result of these many fragile male egos, women seem to go out of their way to soothe their husbands’ anxieties about shifting gender roles: While stay-at-home wives predictably and rightly take on more housework than their employed husbands,breadwinner wivesdo more housework than their unemployed spouses — that is, women who are the primary or sole earners in their marriagesstilldo more around the house than their husbands. Their husbands, however, enjoy significant leisure time: Stay-at-home husbands spend nearly twice as much time on leisure activities as stay-at-home wives. And even among couples who both work and earn roughly equal amounts of money, wives do roughly twice as much housework as their husbands, according to a Pew Research Center study this year. Wives who earn more than their husbands also tend to under-report their earnings, while men inflate theirs, according toresearchfrom the US Census Bureau — something researchers believe signals insecurity on both sides of the gender divide. And that’s perhaps not surprising, given the pressures put on men to be financial providers:A 2017 Pew surveyfound that more than 71% of Americans say that a man has to be able to financially support a family in order to be a good partner; just 32% say the same about women. Women routinely say they are looking for financial equals in their romantic relationships; men, on the other hand, are comparatively happier to date women who earn less than they do, or earn nothing at all. According to the Survey Center on American Lifeat the American Enterprise Institute, 89% of college-educated women and 74% of non-college women say they would be less likely to date a man who was unemployed, while only 66% of college-educated men and 47% of non-college men say they would be less likely to date an unemployed women. Nearly half of women with college degrees, according to the survey, say they struggle to find a partner, even though their expectations don’t seem impossibly high (have a job, live nearby, take care of your health, be decent to women). Fewer than a quarter of single men say they have a hard time finding a romantic mate who meets their expectations. As more women have thrived and more men have floundered, and as men and women alike continue to prioritize men’s earning power, it’s no surprise marriage rates have declined, particularly among the working class where higher rates ofworkplace injury,drug addiction,alcoholismandincarcerationhave pulled men out of the workforce and made them less stable and desirable partners. Swift and Kelce are both fabulously wealthy, and money does make relationships easier —she’s now a billionaire, according to Bloomberg. When couples aren’t stressed about money and resources, and when all of their basic needs are met, any relationship will have a stronger foundation. But even the rich and famous still live in societies with social norms and gendered expectations, and Kelce holds one of the most masculine-coded jobs in the world. There are no female players in the NFL and barely any female coaches or referees; sports fans are disproportionatelymale; and women’s sports getsvirtually no coverageon local TV and ESPN. Sports fans tiltconservative, and conservatives are much more likely to desiretraditional gender rolesin their families and in society more broadly. In the US, there’s no more macho man than the football player, and Kelce himself is a very macho guy: bearded, square-jawed, physically imposing. And apparently happy to be Mr. Taylor Swift. Which in turn makes Kelce’s relationship with his uber-successful andfeminist-minded girlfriend a matter of greatconservative consternation. Right-wing carping aside, the Swift-Kelce romance is a nice reminder that statistics only tell half the story, and there are many, many men out there who don’t hang their masculinity on out-earning or professionally out-ranking their wives or girlfriends, and are thrilled to celebrate their partner’s ambition and success — including when their partners are more ambitious and more successful than they are. And it’s a nice model, especially for the young men who look at sports stars as paragons of masculinity and see Kelce, who asked Swift out by trying to give her afriendship bracelet, who shows up to her concertssinging and dancing, and who, when called “Taylor’s boyfriend” at a game,pumped his fistwith pride. Swift, in turn, makes time in what is an undoubtedly insane schedule to support Kelce athisgames — and to go out with hergirlfriends, too. Some skeptics say that the Swift-Kelce relationship isfake, drummed up for thepositive PR. It does feel a little too perfect: Swift, the popstar who catapulted her way to fame by singing about heartbreak and bad boyfriends and big, swinging teenager feelings, and who is beloved by so many girls because she’s both aspirational and an all-American Everywoman, is in big public puppy love with about the most all-American boy you could imagine. The truth may also be somewhere in the middle: that these two have a romantic connection, but they’re also media-savvy enough to leverage their budding relationship for maximal positive coverage. It’s certainly been good for both of their public profiles. Whether the romance exists or not, the power dynamic it reflects is real: Either Swift and Kelce are genuinely in love and breaking the gender norms typically on display from athletes and often at play in American households, or this is a relationship entered into for mutual benefit, in which case it’s a sign of progress that a football star is happy to be “Taylor’s boyfriend.” Sports stars notoriously partner with WAGs, beautiful women who are reduced to “wives and girlfriends,” and whose own work traditionally ceases or takes a backseat to their partners’ — not unlike the dynamic at play in the relationships of a great many not-famous couples. In the Swift-Kelce relationship, Swift certainly shows up to support him, but it’s hard to imagine that her primary concern is, as one football player’s wifeput it, “Are things taken care of at home so that they can focus on the game?” Sure, Swift isin the bleachers, dating the football star. But she’s also headlining shows all over the world. And her less-famous football player boyfriend is the one in the stands, cheering her on.","        4:37 AM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
169,CNN,The Supreme Court code of conduct misses this big thing,Unknown,"Rules are just empty words if there’s no hope they’ll be followed. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jacksononce wrotethat “if put to the choice, one might well prefer to live under Soviet substantive law applied in good faith by our common-law procedures than under our substantive law enforced by Soviet procedural practices.” Jackson’s point, coming at the height of the Cold War, was that rules don’t matter all that much without some faith that they’ll be applied and enforced in a fair, nonarbitrary way. That mantra was ringing in my head as I reviewed thecode of conductvoluntarilyadopted by the Supreme Courton Monday, the first such formal code to govern the justices. It contains 14 pages of ethics principles and commentary to which the justices say they will now adhere. This move comes after months of mounting public pressure in response to media reports documenting troubling (and previously undisclosed) financial relationships involving Justices Clarence Thomasand Samuel Alitoand wealthy conservative benefactors. (The justices have pushed back on or disputed some of these reports.) We can debate (and folks are debating) thesubstanceof these new (ornot-so-new) rules; the real question is how we, the public, are supposed to have faith that they’ll be followed. In adopting these rules, the Supreme Court didn’t address that issue at all. Most people enforce rules with carrots or sticks — incentives for following the rules or penalties for breaking them. In this case, though, the Constitution gets in the way of either.Article III(the one about the courts) demands that there be “onesupreme Court” (emphasis added), which the justices have long interpreted, not unreasonably, to mean that no one else can sit in direct judgment of their rulings or their behavior (except, in extreme cases,Congress through its powerto impeach sitting justices). Thus, the way that we typically enforce ethics rules and financial disclosure requirements against lower court judges — a body known as the Judicial Conference of the United Statesoversees them — won’t work for the justices. Perhaps that explains why some conservative commentators view the matter now as being closed despitethe new ethics codenot having an enforcement mechanism: The court has done all that we can reasonably expect it to have done, and no one else has any power to do anything further. But even if the Constitution prohibits a direct enforcement mechanism, Congress has, for most of our history, used an array of other powers as sideways leverage against the court — not-so-subtle reminders that Congress can “punish” the court in other ways. Among other things, Congress controls (almost all of) the court’s budget — apower it has used historicallynot just to encourage changes in institutional behaviors, but even to influence the timing of individual justices’ retirements. (Pensions are powerful things.) Congress controls when and where the court sits; until 1935, thecourt satinthe Capitol— a powerful reminder of which branch was beholden to which. And Congress made the court’sentire 1802 term disappear in a shot across the bow of Chief Justice John Marshall while the justices considered the constitutionality of major legislation passed by the newly elected Democratic-Republicans. Congress has also regularly exercised leverage over the court’s docket; until 1891,all of the court’s jurisdictionwas mandatory (meaning that the justices had to hear any appeal Congress told it to hear). That thecourt’s docket todayis almost entirely discretionary is a policy choice by the legislature — one that could be reversed if, again, Congress was looking for sticks. In the past, Congress has even stopped the court from resolving individual cases, includingan especially significant 1868 disputeover the constitutionality of the military government in the South during Reconstruction. This is where the conversation about the justices’ behavior off the bench should go now. What’s needed is more than substantive rules adopted by the justices; even if the new rules were perfect (and they’re not), it’s not obvious why justices who in the past have flouted financial disclosure requirements would all of a sudden go out of their way to over-enforce these new rules against themselves. Instead, what’s needed is some mechanism for obtaining the justices’ compliance with the rules. One possibility is the creation of an Article III inspector general. It’s a position that has long been proposed forlower federal courtsbut that could also have at least a modicum of authority to monitor the justices’ behavior as well. As I’ve suggested before, even if such an officer couldn’t directly punish justices for violating the relevant rules, Congress unquestionably could invest that position with the power to investigate and report upon compliance with those rules — reports that would provide a strong incentive for justices to adhere to the rules, lest they end up on some official, undismissable list (rather than just in media reports) of justices who have misbehaved; and, in extreme cases, provide a basis for the impeachment of justices who continually cross the line. Instead of every new media report about a justice’s personal behavior dividing us into predictable ideological camps, now there would be an ostensibly neutral ombudsperson whose reports could build a record, one way or the other, from which to assess whether and to what extent an individual justice, or the court as a whole, is behaving badly. An Article III inspector general is no panacea. But it’s the least-worst alternative to a problem that the Constitution necessarily creates: how to have an independent Supreme Court that is nevertheless at least loosely accountable to the political branches. Accountability and independencearen’t mutually exclusive— something the justices are tacitly conceding by agreeing for the first time to formally adopt a code of conduct. But saying “trust us” isn’t, and shouldn’t be, enough. To quote the old Russian proverb (as appropriated by President Ronald Reagan), “Trust, but verify.”","        7:45 PM EST, Tue November 14, 2023",14.0,11.0,2023.0
170,CNN,This Nicolas Cage movie is a hard lesson in being human,Unknown,"Across the political spectrum, there’s a consensus that social media is dangerous. Republicanspromiseto ban Tik Tok, because they claim it is collecting data for the Chinese government and spreading antisemitism. Critics on the leftworrythat X, formerly Twitter, has become “a sewer of disinformation,” boosting hate speech and right wing state propaganda. Meanwhile, the right worries about cancel culture and peopletargetedfor public shaming by the left; the left worries about stochastic, or random, terror, and how right-wing hate speech online directed towards LGBTQ people and others canencouragedeath threats and worse. Director Kristoffer Borgli’s latest film, “Dream Scenario,” half builds on, half parodies those fears and anxieties for its absurdist plot. It also suggests, though, that the dynamics and dangers of online existence aren’t exactly new and aren’t exactly about social media at all. Human interconnection is an odd, difficult, bizarre and uncomfortable phenomenon that predates X and Tik Tok. “Dream Scenario”is about how, even before we could see short hip hop dance videos on loop, we’ve always been in each other’s skulls. The movie’s main character is Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage), a tenured professor of evolutionary biology at a small college. Paul’s a boring average guy in a boring average job who never wrote, much less published, his scholarly monograph and is experiencing a bit of a mid-life crisis. Then things get strange. Paul starts to appear in the dreams of his daughter. Then he starts appearing in the dreams of old acquaintances. Then he starts appearing in the dreams of people he doesn’t know at all. Mostly (to real-life Paul’s frustration) dream Paul doesn’t do anything; he just stands there and watches as people get attacked by dream alligators or chased through fields of dream mushrooms. But his passive presence is nonetheless there, and it makes him famous. His class is packed with students who saw him in their dreams and want to see him for real. The advertising agency “Thoughts” wants to hire him to endorse Sprite. His kids’ classmates think he’s a “cool dad.” Even his wife, Janet (Julianne Nicholson), starts to get more opportunities at work. Everything’s great. Until the Paul seen in dreams stops being so passive, and everything for real-life Paul goes to hell. The parallels with social media are obvious and obviously intentional. Paul goes viral for opaque reasons; the world just chooses him to be the thing it’s thinking about, the way social media sometimes latches onto a meme or a craze about astriped dressor a “BBC dad.” And then, for equally random reasons, everyone decides to hate him. The internet giveth, the internet taketh away. It’s not just the internet, though. Dreams in the film are a kind of metaphor for social media. But they’re also a metaphor for a celebrity culture that predates the web. Paul is, after all, actually Nicolas Cage, a ubiquitous movie star who really does almost certainly appear in people’s dreams from time to time. “Dream Scenario” could just as easily be about the way we live with and form opinions and even relationships with people on the screen even though we don’t really know them at all. You may well have some ideas about what sort of person Cage is, even if you’ve never met him. Cage, like Paul, is part of our collective dreaming, which gives him a certain cachet, but also potentially exposes him — he’s beenstalkedby fans, just as Paul is stalked in the film. The movie has implications beyond a movie celebrity, too. Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung’s theories of collective consciousness are mentioned, and Paul’s own research focuses on group intelligence among insects (what he calls “antelligence.”) The movie doesn’t exactly buy into these grand theories of psychic hive minds. Instead, it shows, in smaller ways, how we are shaped by what other people think of us. When people dream that Paul is everywhere, he finds himself in the news, and is suddenly everywhere. When people dream that Paul is sexy, he becomes — not sexy, exactly, but at least more promiscuous. When people dream that Paul is a violent, abusive figure, and stigmatize him, he becomes belligerent, self-pitying, angry and even to some degree violent. Visions of Paul affect other people in unpredictable ways. But by the same token, other people’s visions of Paul affect Paul himself. You don’t have to believe in psychic powers to see that who we are is in part a function of who other people think we are. The fact that we rely on other people to tell us who we are isn’t always a good thing. As “Dream Scenario” suggests, it can be boring or traumatic. It can also just be a nuisance when advertisers and marketing flacks try to place soft drinks and/or crypto scams on your social media feed and/or in your cerebral cortex. But while having other people in your head isn’t always great, the alternative can be significantly worse. (Spoiler alert) Paul, by the end of the film, is isolated from friends, family, work; he ends up dreaming alone about the connections he’s lost. Having people think about you can feel like an impingement on or an infringement of yourself; you’re not fully you if other people have you in their heads. But at the same time, it’s hard to be human in isolation. If you don’t belong to other people, do you even exist? “Dream Scenario” can be viewed as yet another warning about the dangers of social media, viral fame, celebrity culture, cancel culture and so on. It also, though, puts these newfangled fears in the context of longer-standing anxieties about being trapped in here with all the other humans. Interconnection is always messy and dangerous, whether you’re using an app or relying on older technologies — dial-up internet, phones, speech, even language. Tik Tok and X are frightening in part because the fact that we can influence each other, and think for each other, is frightening. It’s also hopeful though. As “Dream Scenario” suggests, for better and worse, to be human is to dream together.","        4:35 PM EST, Mon November 13, 2023",13.0,11.0,2023.0
171,CNN,Ethan Miller/Getty Images•CNN Exclusive,Edward-Isaac Dovere,"President Joe Bidentends to brush off bad polls and insist that there are eight that show him beating Donald Trumpfor every two that show him losing. Vice President Kamala Harris, confronted with those same polls, is much less dismissive. “We’re going to have to earn our reelect, there’s no doubt about it,” the vice president told CNN in an exclusive phone interview from Air Force Two after spending just over an hour in South Carolina on a trip to officially file Biden for the Democratic primary there. Polling nationallyand in battleground states alike suggests the president, who turns 81 on Monday, is weak with young voters, as well as with Black and other voters of color. Overall, Biden and Harris hold similar approval ratings, but Harris’ ratings among these key subgroups have varied, suggesting views of the vice president are not as deeply entrenched. Several Harris insiders have optimistically pointed tothe New York Times/Siena College polls of battleground statesreleased this month, which showed “11 percent of Ms. Harris’s would-be supporters do not back Mr. Biden, and two-thirds of them are either nonwhite or younger than 30,” according to The Times. That has created an uncomfortable dynamic for the Biden team in Wilmington, Delaware, and the West Wing that has mythologized his connection with voters as being stronger than polls can measure and where some are still carrying grudges from the Democratic primary race. Harris is consistently rating better – which, to a growing number of Democrats, means that if Biden wants a second term in an election that Biden aides are forecasting will be won by slivers of votes, he will need to rely on her help to get there. But they need to lean into that marginal advantage without exposing her so much that she proves a liability with voters who don’t like her – including those whom Republican presidential candidates are trying to appeal to by warning that Biden actuarially might not make it through a second term, and a vote for him might end up with Harris in the Oval Office. “People were saying, ‘The VP is a drag on the ticket,’” South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, whoboosted Biden in 2020, said after joining Harris for the filing. “Now they’re saying just the opposite.” “I absolutely think she can move voters,” said Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis, a 34-year-old African American in one of the target demographics the Biden campaign is desperate to improve with, in a state the president needs to carry. “A vital part of the formula” is the assessment of Lavora Barnes, a Black woman herself who is the Democratic Party chair in battleground Michigan. While several people close to Harris say that it might be too late to return to the days when she was seen as an embodiment of the future, they see 2024 as her best and perhaps last chance for a major political reboot – hoping that by maximizing her time on the trail, she can defy the seemingly constant narrative during her time as vice president of stumbles and missed moments. A new abortion rights-focused tour of battleground states is being planned for the beginning of the year, and Harris is also looking for moments to call out the need for more action on gun violence in a continuation of what became one of the most distinctive elements of her summer college tour. Aides said they are hoping to get her to embrace more fully the lead attacker role that running mates often go for, swinging hard with contrast as Biden is expected to stick more with the “Americans working together to get past Trump” approach. After months of several sought after hires turning her down, she has been looking to bring on her own political strategist – “a Mike Donilon type” is how her team talks about it, referring to the president’s longest and closest senior adviser – though some on Biden’s team have been resistant, feeling that they already have Donilon himself and don’t need a Harris cook in the kitchen. (Harris aides said they have already gotten used to dayslong email chains waiting for West Wing aides to sign off on her hitting the road and worrying over costs that would need to be covered by a reelection campaign still not raising money at the clip it hoped for.) Meanwhile, Democratic strategists closely involved with taking what they believe is realistic stock of the president’s capacity are already looking at her to pick up the slack not just on the campaign trail, but by popping up with Tik Tok influencers (she was the top surrogate for influencer conversations during the midterms, racking up over a dozen) or mixing it up on Black drive time radio. There are things that Biden won’t or can’t do – because of the care staff takes not to exhaust him, because they would be too demeaning for the leader of the free world to do or simply because he’s busy with the wars in Ukraine and Israel, and in a never-ending cycle of trying to keep the government open. Asked about how she envisions her time on the trail, Harris started with a typical deconstruction of the premise as she flicked it away: “To be honest, I’ve not compared this cycle with what previous vice presidents have done in a reelect.” “But,” Harris went on, “I have a great sense of duty and responsibility to do as much as I can, to be where the people are and to not only speak with them, but listen to them and let them know what we’ve accomplished.” Her experience so far out and about, Harris said, has informed her sense of how tricky this is going to be. “It is absolutely right in a democracy with free and fair elections that the candidates, the people who want to continue in leadership have to make their case, and have to make it effectively,” Harris told CNN. “And that means communicating in such a way that the message is received about the accomplishments and what we care about.” Communication and messaging advice from a vice president who has become infamous for “word salad” answers might make some political insiders laugh. This is a politician, after all, whose staff the night before a scheduled speech to the most core party members at the Democratic National Committee meeting last month in St. Louis replaced it with a “fireside chat” moderated by her outside adviser and former DNC chair Donna Brazile, worried that otherwise she would struggle to come across, people involved in the switch-up told CNN. That format was adopted from the one she had been using on her popular tour of colleges in the summer and early fall – with an aide acknowledging the problems she has faced. “She is a human, and these moderated conversations are a way for people to see that part of her,” the aide said. That tour proved to be a learning experience for her, giving her the direct voter feedback and engagement that led her to hammer staff to distill phrases like “freedom to not just survive but thrive” into something more relatable: “freedom to live your best life” or, sometimes, “freedom to just be.” That’s part of what she thinks the campaign needs to do too, Harris told CNN. When it comes to appealing to Black voters who feel checked out from a government and political system, which they feel keeps on coming up short on promises to meaningfully improve their lives, the vice president can quickly tick through the administration’s record on funding historically Black colleges and universities, dropping insulin prices and increasing affordable housing. But she knows that isn’t resonating as much as she would like. “In some ways,” Harris said, “actually, probably there’s a hindrance, in that the list is really long, and we have to triage around what we repeat over and over again to make sure that it resonates and it’s actually heard.” In May, the Democratic women’s political group Emily’s List finished polling that had just been completed to inform the efforts they had begun to promote Harris. For all the hits she has taken on social media and all the devastating articles that have left her and the people around her feeling burned and on guard, their research showed that most voters still knew almost nothing about her at all. The vice president did not get a direct briefing on the results, but the way the numbers were laid out in a memo to the group’s top donors quickly made it back to her team. They focused on “gettable” voters – wavering Democrats and independents open to voting for Democrats – in battleground states. A third of voters knew almost nothing about who she was or what she has been doing, but when asked to rate issues that will get them to vote, abortion was at the top, followed by gun violence protection and racial justice. Give those voters information about her, according to people who have seen the polling results, and they could significantly improve answers to questions like, “Do you think she’s ready to be president?” and “Is she a good partner to Biden?” When told that many of those top issues are in Harris’s portfolio, they tracked massive upticks in independents and “soft partisan” non-core Democrats in how they felt about Biden, and whether they were motivated to vote for him. “I get that on the doors – ‘What has she done?’ ‘Can she step up?’” said Rozia Henson, who at 30 just won a campaign to be the first out gay, Black member of the Virginia House of Delegates. A proud member of the online obsessive “K-hive,” he said he spent his whole campaign hearing voters tell him they don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch. “I think we’d be having a way different conversation if it were two White males as president and vice president,” Henson said. “It’s a little bit different when you see people like yourself tell the stories of how they changed things that affect your daily life.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he was struck by how much people connected with Harris when she appeared at a rally he hosted in Raleigh on the anniversary of the Dobbs decision earlier this year. In a state that the Biden campaign has made a top target for picking up next year, Cooper told CNN that Harris “is in a unique position to deliver the message to a number of people that may be more receptive to talking about the good things that they’ve done and talking about what will happen to people’s rights and freedoms if extreme Republicans win this election.” Quentin Fulks, one of Biden’s deputy campaign managers, said in an interview that he expects this to play to the strengths that first made Harris a political star, from grilling Republicans in Senate hearings to her original “prosecutor for president” pitch when she first launched her own 2020 White House campaign. “Being a prosecutor is in her blood. Litigating what the election is about is in her blood,” Fulks said, describing that as complementary to Biden’s empathetic and usually more soft-pedaled approach, even with his recent uptick in jabs at Trump. “It’s what’s most comfortable to her. And what you’re most comfortable about, you’re going to do well.” Because Harris’ presidential campaign was over before most people started paying attention – she dropped out ahead of the nominating contests – and her time as a running mate in a campaign that was defined by pandemic social distancing and car rallies, almost no one has seen her as a full-fledged candidate out on the trail. That includes Fulks, who, despite helping run the campaign, had never himself seen Harris stump in person before joining her for that South Carolina trip. “In Washington, DC, she’s the leader and she’s next up,” Fulks said. “But on the trail, it’s something special to watch and it’s very different.” Harris continues to get subsumed – though she is the point person for the new White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, Biden was still the one who took the lead on commenting on the Maine mass shooting three weeks later and the one to travel there, and her college tour was cut short by making sure she was in the meetings (and being photographed in the meetings) on the Israel-Gaza crisis. But she’s been pushing back on that. She joined the event in South Carolina she wasn’t initially scheduled to be at. Two days earlier, she popped up on the White House driveway to give reporters her own reaction to the off-year election results – to the consternation of some on the president’s staff who didn’t like that she was doing it without warning and that she did it while the daily press briefing was happening a few feet away inside. Harris quickly shoots down any hint that campaigning would conflict with being an integral part of the administration every day, and quickly rattles off what she has been doing on artificial intelligence, the APEC leaders conference and more. “All of it is connected,” she said. In Nevada, some polls show a challenging landscape for Biden. Daniele Monroe-Moreno, speaker pro tempore of the Nevada legislature and the new chair of the state’s Democratic Party, said that the issue goes beyond how to talk about Biden’s record. As devoted as she is to Biden, Monroe-Moreno said, his hardscrabble Irish Catholic childhood stories from Scranton in the 1940s only go so far. She herself is about Harris’ age, is also married to a Jewish man, had a more up-to-date version of struggles growing up and has a more mixed family now. “The president’s story resonates with my mom and with me. But Kamala and our history really resonates with me,” Monroe-Moreno said. “Where she is now as the vice president of the United States lets Black voters and women voters know there is a pathway forward for us in this country.” Monroe-Moreno said she saw that ring true for the younger voters who filled a room when Harris was at the College of Southern Nevada last month. “They weren’t just Black and brown kids, they were White kids who look to her as a leader for the future,” she said. “President Biden is wise, knowledgeable, tested – she’s passionate and seasoned,” said Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, who just won a second term in the second largest city in battleground Arizona. “Communities of color and young people, they absorb that passion from her.” In the interview, Harris ticked through the administration’s record on fighting climate change, reducing gun violence that has become a standard part of going to school or walking down the street for a generation and protecting reproductive rights. She built up to a line primed for a teleprompter: “The president has been resolute, he has been firm, he has been consistent on seeing the challenges that young people in America face and addressing them with real solutions.” But asked why young people should see themselves in a president who is old enough to be older than many of their grandparents, Harris was a little less formal. “It is they,” Harris said in thinking about the election winner, “who are going to either benefit from or pay the price.”","        2:44 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
172,CNN,De Santis argues Trump and Biden are too old for presidency,Kit Maher,"Florida Gov. Ron De Santis said Sunday the presidency is “not a job for somebody that is pushing 80” as he sought to contrast his youth relative to former President Donald Trump, 77, and President Joe Biden, who turns 81 on Monday. De Santis, 45, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that “I just think that that’s something that has been shown with Joe Biden. Father Time is undefeated. Donald Trump is not exempt from any of that.” The Florida governor argued that he is in the “prime of my life” while noting that Trump would be older than Biden was at the start of his term if he were to take office in 2025. Age has quickly become a central theme of the 2024 presidential race.Trumphas made mocking Biden and questioning his mental fitness for officea core part of his campaign speeches– even as he’s experienced his own gaffes and verbal slips on the trail. The Florida governor’s campaign has leaned into this dynamic, launching an “accident tracker” for Trump gaffes last month that highlights apparent verbal slip-ups, such as when Trump appeared to confuse Biden with former President Barack Obama. Beyond age, De Santis said these “accidents” point to Trump not being “the same guy” he was when he first ran for president. Pressed by Tapper on Trump’s mental acuity and his ability to beat Biden in a general election, De Santis said, “I wouldn’t be running unless I thought that the Democrats would beat Trump if he were the nominee.” Democrats, De Santis said, are “going very easy” on Trump as the Republican primary plays out but insisted that would change if Trump captures the GOP nomination. “You’re gonna see scorched earth. You’re gonna see all this stuff brought out from from the past,” he said. “The whole election will end up being a referendum on Donald Trump, and Biden will be able to hang out in the basement, and I think he’ll be able to get away with it again.” One Iowa voter agreed with De Santis’ comments to Tapper, telling CNN that he watched De Santis on “State of the Union” before heading to a campaign event in Plainfield, Iowa. John Walker, who lives outside of Denver, Iowa, said De Santis “mentioned that he will be a possible two-term president, and Trump will be immediately a lame duck when he comes in. And I like that because I haven’t heard a lot of candidates talk about that.” Walker, who previously voted for Trump, added that he still likes the former president, but said, “I just think there’s a huge amount of uncertainty with Trump, and I don’t like that.” Withwaning poll numbers, De Santis has kept a vigorous pace on the campaign trail. Over the past two days, he has appeared at eight public events, and he continued his swing through Iowa on Sunday. In contrast with Biden and Trump, De Santis often hits campaign events with his wife, Casey, and three young kids. “I will serve two terms, deliver big results, and get the country moving again,” De Santis said Sunday. “That’s what Republican voters want to see.” This story has been updated with additional information.","        9:05 PM EST, Sun November 19, 2023",19.0,11.0,2023.0
173,CNN,Opinion Bad behavior test isn’t just about George Santos,Unknown,"In his new book “Determined,” neurobiologist Robert M. Sapolsky argues that there is no such thing as free will: everything we do is the result of factors such as biology, environment, culture and genetics. “When you behave in a particular way, which is to say when your brain has generated a particular behavior,” hewrites, “it is because of the determinism that came just before, which was caused by the determinism just before that, and before that, all the way down…we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment.” The consequences of accepting Sapolsky’s view would be revolutionary: it would make no sense to blame people for bad behavior. What they do results from neurons firing in assorted regions of the brain, the product of an array of causes they can’t control. Yet even Sapolsky recognizes that taking the absence of free will seriously “sounds absolutely nutty.” But how else to explain what went on in Congress last week? On Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders had to intervene when a fellow senator challenged the Teamsters president, who was testifying at a hearing, to a “stand your butt up” fight. A House committee chairman called a colleague a “smurf” and a “liar.” And, as Douglas Heye, who formerly worked for the House Republican leadership, noted, “Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett accused former Speaker Kevin Mc Carthy of elbowing him with a ‘clean kidney shot,’ a charge Mc Carthy denies. These events — all of which happened before lunch was over — are more and more typical of daily life in Congress.” “The reality is that Congress has become a terrible workplace, and members and staff are feeling those effects,” Heye observed. Burchett was one of eight Republicans instrumental in Mc Carthy’s ouster for the sin of allying with Democrats to pass a short-term measure to keep the government operating. Decapitating the speaker led tortuously to the choice of a new speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson. What did Johnson do last week? He allied with Democrats to pass a short-term measure to keep the government operating. As if to punctuate the wild week, the House Ethics Committee issued a report Thursdayaccusingthe indicted Rep. George Santos of New York of seeking to “fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit.” He charged the campaign for expenses related to apparently personal trips to Las Vegas and Atlantic City, along with cosmetic products and services, the report alleged. It accused him of “blatantly” stealing from his campaign, deceiving “donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign but were in fact payments for his personal benefit” and constantly lying about his “background and experience.” Santos, facing potential expulsion from the House, responded by announcing he will not seek reelection next year. As Julian Zelizernoted, we know of Santos only because he “fabricated a record, a whole fake life really, to become one of the handful of Long Island Republicans who helped swing control of the House from the Democrats to the GOP…” “The Santos story, as dramatic as it has been, is just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that has allowed US democracy todescend into a morass of disinformation and falsehood.” “Santos may be bowing out, but Trump is still their 2024 presidential frontrunner. Four indictments aside, as well as numerous civil suits, Trump remains popular and enormously powerful despite a fact-checking record so long that it should find a place in the Guinness Book of World Records,” Zelizer wrote. For more on Congress: John Avlon:Republicans only care about the debt when a Democrat is president Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is gaining ground with New Hampshire voters, according to a CNNpoll, which puts her second in the GOP primary race, though still far behind Trump. But SE Cuppargued that Haley made a big misstep in saying on Fox News “that if elected president she’d solve the problem of social media bots and incivility by requiring ‘every person on social media [to] be verified by their name.’” She later amended that thought to apply it only to people outside the US. Cupp pointed out that “What Haley is missing isn’t just the importance of anonymous speech in our founding, or the fact that anonymous speech is protected under the First Amendment, but the fact thatanonymous speech actually keeps us safe.” It protects whistleblowers, victims of sexual assault and harassment as well as dissidents living under repressive regimes, Cupp noted. “The most important factor in determining the political outcome of Israel’s current war will not take place in Gaza — but will instead unfold in the West Bank,” wrote Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. He argued that for Israel to cripple the political power of Hamas among Palestinians it will need “to seriously rethink its attitude towards the Islamist extremist group’s archrivals: the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on the international stage.” “Without strengthening these Palestinian groups, which still represent the mainstream of the national movement, Hamas and even more extreme groups will almost certainly continue to grow and thrive among the Palestinian people.” “A negotiated agreement with the Palestinian factions who, despite everything, still want to reach a peace deal with Israel — for good or ill, currently led by Abbas — can bring that about.It’s the only thing that can bring Israelis peace and genuine security.” After the outbreak of the war,Fatma Ashour, a lawyer and human rights activist, fled south from Gaza City to Khan Younis, where she is living ina house with 28 people. “Eight children, and 3 elderly people. Our priority is those 11 people. We give them breakfast. If there is not bread, they can have a biscuit or whatever can be found. If we find dates, they can have one each. If there’s neither, we use powder milk to make them tea. That’s how things stand. We, the grown-ups, we have to endure. We only eat lunch…” “Some of the people with us have run out of money. We help them as much as we can. Every now and then someone bursts out crying — a member of his family has been killed, or his house destroyed.It’s an unbearable situation.” Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg, a progressive based in Minneapolis, drew national attention after she bought a ticket to a campaign fundraiser for President Joe Biden and stood up to ask him to “call for a ceasefire right now.” Biden replied by recommending “a pause.” And while Israel has implemented regular pauses, Rosenberg argued that these are not enough:“Biden and others in his administration have continued to mince their words, calling time and again for a pause, instead of speaking out loudly and unambiguously forthe one thing in Gaza that will truly end the sufferingand save innocent lives: a ceasefire.“ Aviva Klompas, former director of speechwriting at the Israeli Mission to the United Nations, observed that“accepting a ceasefire now will cost many more lives in the long run” if Hamas’ infrastructure isn’t destroyed after its October 7 attack on Israel. “A ceasefire would be a de facto victory for a nihilistic jihadi terrorist organization that is financed and backed by Iran, one of whose leaders recently stood on American soil and warned that ‘new fronts will be opened up against the United States.’ Any truce would leave Hamas’ leadership, military, weapons and deadly ideology — along with its network of tunnels — intact. It would also broadcast a message to Iran and its other proxy terror groups that there are no real consequences for committing large-scale atrocities.” A 21-year-old “Letter to America,” purportedly written by terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, became thefocusof posters on Tik Tok, who endorsed his critique of US behavior in the Middle East. The Guardian, which had posted the letter as part of its news coverage in 2002, took it down amid the flurry of attention last week. Peter Bergen, author of a biography of bin Laden, wrote, “Let’s be clear:Osama bin Laden was not a deep thinker but the leader of a group responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans and other Westerners, along with tens of thousands of people in Muslim-majority countries.So, the fact that people on Tik Tok are extolling bin Laden’s 2002 ‘Letter to America,’ al Qaeda’s rationale for the 9/11 attacks, in videos that have been watched at least 14 million times is simply baffling. Most of the people praising bin Laden on Tik Tok seem to be in their 20s, so they were either not born or were young children when 9/11 happened, and they seem to be entirely ignorant of the actual history of al Qaeda.” For more: Joan Steinau Lester:The unwelcome topic at this year’s Thanksgiving table President Biden met with China’s President Xi Jinping at an estate outside San Francisco Wednesday. The fact that the leaders of the two powers, increasingly at odds, are still talking is likely more important than the specifics of their agreement on matters such as restoring direct contact between US and China military leaders. There was no visible sign of progress on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Writing before the summit,Frida Ghitisnoted, “Biden may want Xi to help bring down the temperature on the world’s ongoing wars and help prevent new ones from igniting. Butfrom Xi’s perspective, today’s open conflicts are damaging to the US-led world orderand hence, I believe, helpful to his goal of seeing the US fail as the world’s preeminent superpower, allowing China to emerge as an alternative.” After the four-hour meeting, Biden said Xi agreed to reduce exports of chemicals that are used to manufacture fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid routinely smuggled from Mexico to the US. “If China can indeed get a handle on the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals, thatmight help make a difference in preventing the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans succumbing each year to overdoses,”Peter Bergenwrote. Who will guard the guardians? That question, posed by Juvenal, the Roman poet more than 2,000 years ago, is at the heart of the controversy over the Supreme Court’s new ethics code, which sets out 14 pages of rules and commentary. It follows revelations about unreported financial ties between two justices and deep-pocketed conservatives. As Stephen I. Vladeckasked, how is the public “supposed to have faith that they’ll be followed. In adopting these rules, the Supreme Court didn’t address that issue at all.” “What’s needed is some mechanism for obtaining the justices’ compliance with the rules. One possibility is the creation of an Article III inspector general. It’s a position that has long been proposed for lower federal courts but that could also have at least a modicum of authority to monitor the justices’ behavior as well.” Finally there may be some good news for home buyers. A jury’s ruling last month in Kansas City, Missouri is likely to end the 5% to 6% real estate commission rate that is typical in the US, but much higher than in most parts of the world. “The industry argues that requiring homebuyers to pay commissions would make it difficult for some to afford homeownership,” wrote Stephen Brobeckof the Consumer Federation of America. “In reality,effective rate competition would lower — not raise — the cost of buying a home. Today, buyer agent commissions are baked into the sale price of homes, but buyers are unable to comparison shop for and negotiate them. If buyers knew they were paying these commissions, many would look for lower rates, have serious conversations with their agents about compensation and try to negotiate lower commissions.” Former President Donald Trump came under sharp criticism for his incendiary remarks in New Hampshire: “We will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical leftthugs that live like verminwithin the confines of our country.” Bidentoldcampaign donors it was reminiscent of “language you heard in Nazi Germany in the 30s.” But Dean Obeidallahpointed to another aspect of Trump’s recent public appearances. “I’m not talking about Trump saying outrageous and incendiary remarks or lying to help himself politically. We are all — sadly — used to that Trump. No, this is something far more alarming. In just the past two months of campaigning,Trump’s confusion and errors range from saying he defeated Barack Obama in 2016to confusing the name of the city and state he was in.” “What makes all of this really interesting is that the shoe is now on the other foot: Trump has long railed that the 80-year-old Biden, his likely Democratic opponent in the 2024 presidential race, was showing the effects of aging in his mental abilities. In fact, Biden is just three years older than the 77-year-old Trump.” For more: Peter Bergen:Trump’s ridiculous terrorism claim Megan Fox isn’t the first celebrity to take up the pen of a poet,Patricia Grisafiwrote. “Jewel, Tupac Shakur, Billy Corgan, Alicia Keys, Mary Lambert, Florence Welch, Halsey and Lana del Rey, among others, have all penned and published poetry with varying degrees of commercial success.” And, after all, Bob Dylan received a Nobel Prize for “new poetic expressions” in his body of work. “Fox’s poetry matters because women and their stories matter,” Grisafi observed. “No matter how often we are told that we need to listen to women, the prevailing message is always that women should shut up.” “Where Fox would be the muse for other artists, she is now a creator and a muse for her own art. Her body, famous subject of the male gaze, becomes a poetic body that is the site of multiple traumas, struggling to speak and make meaning…These are feminist poems, and they carry Fox’s message: reject silence.” Flying for the holiday? Get ready for “flight delays, cancellations, lost baggage and all the miseries that come with flying,” warned Ganesh Sitaraman, author of the new book, “Why Flying is Miserable.” “Airlines make money when they cut costs and increase profits, which can mean worse service for flyers.If we want to make flying less miserable, policymakers — and the traveling public — will have to tackle these incentives.” The airline industry once gave passengers piano bars in planes, poker machines and steak and champagne, Sitaraman noted. But in 1978, Congress deregulated the airlines and it became a race to the bottom. “Today’s miseries of flying derive from this choice to deregulate airlines and unleash them into the Hunger Games of ordinary incentives. Added fees for baggage, an increasing number of fare classes, differential pricing — these all make perfect sense as a way to squeeze money out of passengers.” Fareed Zakaria:The strategy that can support Ukraine even if Trump is elected Jill Filipovic:Travis Kelce is happy to be Mr. Taylor Swift Judi Ketteler:We defeated ‘Moms for Liberty’ in our small Ohio community Noah Berlatsky:This Nicolas Cage movie is a hard lesson in being human AND… The beginning of the final season of the royal soap opera “The Crown” has landed, and it doesn’t hold back. As Holly Thomaswrote, “The undisputed star of season six — or at least, of the first four episodes released this week — is the late Princess Diana, played by Elizabeth Debicki. This installment, which covers the weeks leading up to Diana’s death in 1997, sees the stiff fabric of the show unravel as everyone is dragged irresistibly into her orbit.” The measured, stately pace of the series so far is upended by the all-consuming tragic story, which even includes “ghostly, posthumous visions of Diana.” “The episodes melt into each other,” Thomas noted. “Their themes are all the same: Diana, as ever, outshining her former in-laws; Prince Charles’ jealousy as he seeks public approval for Camilla Parker-Bowles; the senior royals’ resisting modernization and Mohamed Al-Fayed’s attempts to fashion his son Dodi as the new Mr. Spencer. Images of Diana cavorting on Al-Fayed’s yacht in a swimsuit and the paparazzi hurtling after her could be placed almost anywhere on the storyboard.

174,CNN,Camille Wesser/Moment RF/Getty Images,Unknown,"Editor’s note:Season 8 of the podcast Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Guptagets back to basics with an in-depth examination of the brain in different states. Each episode will focus on one of those states — the distracted brain, the frightened brain, the nourished brain, etc. — to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it affects our bodies. (CNN) —Depression is going up in the United States. Chances are if you don’t struggle with the condition, you almost certainly know someone who does. Nearly 18% of US adults — more than 1 in 6 — said they arecurrently depressed or getting treatment for depression, according to a2023 Gallup Poll. In 2015, when Gallup first started collecting information on the topic, the number was under 11%. Gallup’s data shows that clinical depression was slowly rising in the country before the pandemic, but it grew faster in its aftermath, with social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection, psychological exhaustion, substance abuse and disruption in mental health care all taking a toll. Rates among women, young adults, and Black and Hispanic adults are rising the fastest. For adolescents, ages 12 to 17, the statistics are also dire: According tothe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 million kids in that age group — just over 20% — experienced an episode of major depression in 2021 (the most recent year with available data), with 3.7 million experiencing severe impairment. Psychiatrist Charles Raison, a professor of human ecology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he has struggled with depression himself. Raison, who is alsothe director of the Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Centeranda former mental health expertfor CNN Health, described the state of mental health in the Unites States in one word: “bad.” “There is just no doubt that depression and anxiety and suicide and substance abuse have been on the rise in the United States … for probably 20, 25 years, maybe longer,” Raison told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the podcast Chasing Life. “But they’ve really been on the rise over the last 10 years, and the data are really consistent. “The rise is not equal amongst all age groups,” Raison said. “The people that are really suffering are young people. So, people between the ages of like 15 and 35, that’s where you see this really, really disturbing increase.” While the rise of depression among Americans is alarming, what’s also unsettling is the difficulty in pinpointing the cause.We can’t see it on a brain scan.We don’t have a blood test for it. We can’t measure its severity accurately. Raison compared depression to “dropsy” — an old-fashioned term foredema— which could be caused by different underlying conditions or factors. “It could be … heart failure. It could be pneumonia. It could be cancer. There (are) different reasons to produce those symptoms,” he said. “Will we ever find a test for diagnosing depression? No, because depression is like dropsy …,” he said, pointing to possible different underlying causes. “Depression is not a single thing that’s going to yield itself to a single test.” And that may be one reason why depression is so challenging to treat. Take antidepressants such as Prozac, also known by the generic name fluoxetine. It was launched in the country 35 years ago as the first in a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. The idea was depression resulted from a chemical imbalance in the brain, and the imbalance could be corrected by targeting the neurotransmitter serotonin.Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, which target two neurotransmitters, followed in 1993. But antidepressantsdon’t work for everyone. “The question of the use of antidepressants, which are the first-line treatment for depression in the United States, is incredibly complex,” Raison said, noting that they are “lifesavers for some folks.” “But as we’ve gone along in the last 20 years, we’ve had to metabolize, as a field, a number of very hard truths about antidepressants and their effectiveness,” he said. “One hard truth, and the most obvious one, is that they don’t work nearly as well as we thought they did 30 years ago,” estimating that only 30% of patients “get a full response.” To hear what promising new treatments are being tried for depression, listen to the full episode of Chasing Life here: Raison acknowledged that trying to do anything when you are depressed is an uphill battle. He offered these five tips for self-care. Make an appointment with a mental health professional. “If you’re feeling unremittingly down, if you’ve lost interest in life, if your sleep and your appetite are altered, if you feel hopeless, if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself, these sorts of things — that’s what depressionis,” Raison said. Getting help is especially important if you’ve experienced those symptoms for a couple of months. “All of us who struggle with depression know that having a clinician … can help you — either with psychotherapy or medications … or both,” he said. It turns out that what is good for the body is also good for the brain. “Really try to do the sort of things that you would do for your physical health,” Raison said. “I often tell people, ‘Think about what you’d do if you wanted to deal with your heart health and do the same thing.’ All those things are also antidepressants. So managing body weight, eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, getting enough exercise, getting sunlight.” Try to maintain close relationships. “(Tip) No. 3 is sometimes very hard when you’re depressed. … But it is probably the single most important thing, which is trying to maximize our interpersonal connections with other people,” Raison said. “If you have caring, smaller, supportive relationships with other people, it’s a big protective factor against getting depressed. It’s also a factor that can really help you get over depression.” Be persistent in seeking help. “The way people, especially in United States, respond to antidepressant medications tends to be very bifurcated,” Raison said. “There’s a smaller group of people that just start an antidepressant, and they feel better within a couple of weeks and … and the depression goes away,” while others struggle with chronic depression. So, if one antidepressant doesn’t work, he said, “Try another.” But don’t be afraid to move on. “We’ve known for a long time, for instance, that people who don’t respond to a bunch of antidepressants in a row are less likely to respond to the next one, but they’re not less likely to respond to psychotherapy,” he said. Generate a state of thankfulness. “Work on developing an attitude of gratitude,” Raison said. Raison admits doing so is not always easy when you’re depressed. “If you can make it a habit, it can be very powerful both to prevent depression, but also to feel better if you are depressed,” he said. We hope these five tips help you better care for a depressed brain. Listen tothe full episode here.

175,CNN,Keep an eye on the sky for the Leonid meteor shower this weekend,Unknown,"Up next for end-of-year celestial spectaculars is the Leonid meteor shower, set to produce bright meteors with persistent trains streaking across the night sky. The Leonids have been active since early November but are expected to peak this weekend at 12:33 a.m. ET Saturday,according to Earth Sky. Sky-gazers could see 10 to 15 meteors per hour in a dazzling display. Those looking to catch a glimpse of a meteor from this shower are in luck because the moon will be in its waxing crescent phase, and there will not be as much light interference as there is with a full moon, said Dr. Sharon Morsink,a professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. The moon will be 23% full on the night of the shower’s peak, according to the American Meteor Society. While the peak is on Saturday, the same rates of meteors can be seen a few days before and afterward. The best time to view the shower will be after midnight in any time zone when the constellation Leo will be the highest in the sky, said Morsink, who also manages the university’s astronomical observatory. Leo is the meteor shower’s radiant, which is the point where the phenomenon appears to originate from, she explained. “The most important thing is to get away from light pollution,” Morsink said. “You can still see some meteors if you’re in the city, but you’re not going to see anywhere near the number that you get to see if you get out of the city.” The Leonids are famed for generating meteor storms, the term used when a shower reaches rates of at least 1,000 meteors per hour,according to NASA. Holding the record for the highest rate of meteors per hour seen in a meteor stream, the Leonids produced 144,000 meteors per hour in 1966, according tothe American Meteor Society. The shower also produced outbursts of higher rates in 1999 and 2001, but the society does not expect another storm until 2099, when the Earth is predicted to encounter a dense cloud of debris from the parent comet, Tempel-Tuttle. As the comet travels around the sun, it leaves a trail of rocks and dust that appears as the annual Leonid meteor shower when Earth moves through the debris while on its own orbital path. Although a Leonid storm event is not predicted for this year, there is always a chance to see a few more meteors than the predicted rate, Morsink said. “Getting out and seeing any meteor shower for the first time is always fun,” she said. “It’s just this interesting connection that we have with the whole solar system — here’s this comet that is far away from us that has been circling the sun for an incredibly long period, billions of years probably. … It’s a way for us to connect with things that are really far away.” Meteors from the Leonids are expected to be seen blazing in the sky until the shower’s finality on December 2, according to the American Meteor Society. If you are eager to see more, here are the remaining meteor showers that peak in 2023: ● Geminids: December 13-14 ● Ursids: December 21-22 There are two full moons remaining in 2023,according to the Farmers’ Almanac: ● November 27: Beaver moon ● December 26: Cold moon","        6:00 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
176,CNN,Stellar corpse called ‘Tasmanian devil’ reveals new phenomenon,Ashley Strickland,"Space is full of extreme phenomena, but the “Tasmanian devil” may be one of the weirdest and rarest cosmic events ever observed. Months after astronomers witnessed the explosion of a distant star, they spotted something they have never seen before: energetic signs of life releasing from the stellar corpse about 1 billion light-years from Earth. The short, bright flares were just as powerful as the original event that caused the star’s death. Astronomers dubbed the celestial object the “Tasmanian devil,” and they observed it exploding repeatedly following its initial detection in September 2022. But the initial stellar explosion that caused the star’s death wasn’t any typical supernova, an increasingly bright star that explodes and ejects most of its mass before dying. Instead, it was a rare type of explosion called a luminous fast blue optical transient, or LFBOT. LFBOTs shine brightly in blue light, reaching the peak of their brightness and fading within days, while supernovas can take weeks or months to dim. Thefirst LFBOT was discovered in 2018, and astronomers have been trying to determine the cause of the rare cataclysmic events since. But the Tasmanian devil is revealing more questions than answers with its unexpected behavior. While LFBOTs are unusual events, the Tasmanian devil is even stranger, causing astronomers to question the processes behind the repetitive explosions. “Amazingly, instead of fading steadily as one would expect, the source briefly brightened again — and again, and again,” said lead study author Anna Y.Q. Ho, assistant professor of astronomy in Cornell University’s College of Arts and Sciences, in a statement. “LFBOTs are already a kind of weird, exotic event, so this was even weirder.” The findings about the latest Tasmanian devil LFBOT discovery, officially labeled AT2022tsd and observed with 15 telescopes around the globe, published Wednesday in the journal Nature. “(LFBOTs) emit more energy than an entire galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars like the Sun. The mechanism behind this massive amount of energy is currently unknown,” said study coauthor Jeff Cooke, a professor at Australia’s Swinburne University of Technology and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery, in a statement. “But in this case, after the initial burst and fade, the extreme explosions just kept happening, occurring very fast — over minutes, rather than weeks to months, as is the case for supernovae.” Software written by Ho initially flagged the event. The software sifts through a half-million transients detected daily by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California, which surveys the night sky. Ho and her collaborators at different institutions continued to monitor the explosion as it faded and reviewed the observations a few months later. The images showed intense bright spikes of light that soon vanished. “No one really knew what to say,” Ho said. “We had never seen anything like that before — something so fast, and the brightness as strong as the original explosion months later — in any supernova or FBOT (fast blue optical transient).We’d never seen that, period, in astronomy.” To better understand the quick luminosity changes occurring in the Tasmanian devil, Ho and her colleagues reached out to other researchers to compare observations from multiple telescopes. Altogether, the 15 observatories, including the high-speed camera ULTRASPEC mounted on the 2.4-meter Thai National Telescope, tracked 14 irregular light pulses over 120 days, which is likely just a fraction of the total number of flares released by the LFBOT, Ho said. Some of the flares only lasted tens of seconds, which to astronomers suggests that the underlying cause is a stellar remnant formed by the initial explosion — either a dense neutron star or a black hole. “This settles years of debate about what powers this type of explosion, and reveals an unusually direct method of studying the activity of stellar corpses,” Ho said. Either object is likely taking on large amounts of matter, which fuels the subsequent bursts. “It pushes the limits of physics because of its extreme energy production, but also because of the short duration bursts,” Cooke said. “Light travels at a finite speed. As such, how fast a source can burst and fade away limits the size of a source, meaning that all this energy is being generated from a relatively small source.” If it’s a black hole, the celestial object may be ejecting jets of material and launching them across space at near the speed of light. Another possibility is that the initial explosion was triggered by an unconventional event, such as a star merging with a black hole, which could present “a completely different channel for cosmic cataclysms,” Ho said. Studying LFBOTs could reveal more about the afterlife of a star, rather than just its life cycle that ends with an explosion and a remnant. “Because the corpse is not just sitting there, it’s active and doing things that we can detect,” Ho said. “We think these flares could be coming from one of these newly formed corpses, which gives us a way to study their properties when they’ve just been formed.” Astronomers will keep surveying the sky for LFBOTs to see how common they are and uncover more of their secrets. “This discovery teaches us more about the varied ways in which stars end their lives and the exotica that inhabit our Universe,” said study coauthor Vik Dhillon, professor in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, in a statement.","        5:25 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
177,CNN,CRISPR treatment has been greenlit in UK in global first,Katie Hunt,"The United Kingdom has become the first country to give regulatory approval to a medical treatment involving the revolutionary CRISPR gene editing tool. The country’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said Thursday it had given a greenlight to a treatment known as Casgevy, which will be used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Both genetic conditions are caused by errors in the genes for hemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. There is no known universally successful treatment for either disorder. Sickle cell disease, which can result in attacks of debilitating pain, is more common in people with an African or Caribbean family background. Beta thalassemia mainly affects people of Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin,the statement said. “Both sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia are painful, life-long conditions that in some cases can be fatal. To date, a bone marrow transplant — which must come from a closely matched donor and carries a risk of rejection — has been the only permanent treatment option,” said Julian Beach, the interim executive director of healthcare quality and access at the MHRA, in a statement. “I am pleased to announce that we have authorised an innovative and first-of-its-kind gene-editing treatment called Casgevy, which in trials has been found to restore healthy haemoglobin production in the majority of participants with sickle-cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia, relieving the symptoms of disease.” The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique allows scientists to make very precise changes to DNA.

The treatment,made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is administered by taking stem cells out of a patient’s bone marrow and editing a gene in the cells in a lab. Patients then must undergo a “conditioning treatment,” which can involve an immunosuppressing drug, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, to prepare the bone marrow before the modified cells are infused back into the patient, according to the MHRA. “After that, patients may need to spend at least a month in a hospital facility while the treated cells take up residence in the bone marrow and start to make red blood cells with the stable form of haemoglobin,” according to the statement. The US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the same treatment andis expected to make a decisionon whether to greenlight it by December 8. “This is a great step in the advancement of medical approaches to tackle genetic diseases we never thought would be possible to cure,” said Alena Pance, a senior lecturer in genetics at the University of Hertfordshire, in a statement released by the Science Media Centre, which provides information to journalists. “Modifying the stem cells from the bone marrow of the patient avoids the problems associated with immune compatibility, i.e. searching for donors that match the patient and following immunosuppression, and constituting a real cure of the disease rather than a treatment,” Pance added. The release from the MHRA did not say how much the treatment would cost, but it’s likely to be expensive. CRISPR-Cas9 has had a major impact on biomedical research, clinical medicine and agriculture and is widely used in labs around the world. The cutting-edge technology was tainted with controversy after Chinese scientist He Jiankuiannounced in 2018 he had created the world’s first gene-edited babies. Scientists say the powerful technique should not be used to manipulate human genes that will be passed down from one generation to the next.","        12:14 PM EST, Thu November 16, 2023",16.0,11.0,2023.0
178,CNN,Analysis: Clap with me now for Marlon Wayans,Unknown,"Comedian and actor Marlon Wayans loves his son unconditionally. That may come as a surprise to some people because his son is transgender. Wayans shared the gender identity of his son, 23-year-old Kai Wayans, recently when he revealed details of a comedy special that he plans to release about their journey to acceptance. It hit me like a blast of fresh air in a society otherwise polluted with transphobia. Despite the genre of Wayans’ special, the challenges trans people are facing in this moment is no laughing matter. “Trans youth are hurting right now,” said Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, executive director of GLSEN, a national network of educators, students and local chapters fighting for inclusive education. “They are being told by lawmakers every single day that they don’t belong,” she said. “They see it when their school bans books that reflect their experiences. They see it when talking heads get on TV and debate their right to exist. The best thing a parent can do for their child is be their advocate. I’m proud to see Marlon Wayans rising up for his son and for trans youth everywhere.” In a raw interview last week with “The Breakfast Club”  radio show, Wayans shared that as his son transitioned genders, he transitioned as a parent from “ignorance and denial to complete unconditional love and acceptance.” Wayans said it was important for him to speak out because there are “a lot of parents out there that need that message, and I know I’m dealing with it.” Wayans’ affirmation of his trans child is a welcome refrain from the chorus ofhundreds of anti-trans billsthat have been introduced or passed in the past legislative year, many aimed at stripping trans people of access to health care, sports, identity document changes or even acknowledgement of their existence in academic curriculum. Despite whatever preconceived notions or expectations Wayans may have had for his now-grown child, he also understood that affirming his child’s identity was the predominant influence on their well-being and safety. “If they can’t get that in the household with their father and their mother, how the f**k do I send them out into the world with that kind of confidence?” he said. “I’m just so proud of them for being them.” Providing a safe and welcoming home for trans and LGBTQ children — or any children for that matter — is the most critical variable that informs their safety and well-being. Rejection by one’s family for being trans increases the odds of depression and suicide, according to a2016 study in LGBT Health. Having an accepting family can reduce the suicide rate for LGBTQ people, according to anotherstudy out of the Family Acceptance Projectat San Francisco State University. According to the Trevor Project, a staggering45% of LGBTQ youthseriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. “All young people deserve parents who love and accept them for who they truly are,” said Dr. Ronita Nath, vice president of research at the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to address bullying and suicide within the LGBTQ community. “Especially as we continue to witness such vitriolic anti-transgender rhetoric from politicians across the US right now, it warms my heart to see parents show unwavering support for their trans kids.” The low number of trans young adults who feel safe at home remains stark. Fewer than 1 in 3 trans and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming, according to a2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Healthby the Trevor Project. “It’s no hyperbole to say that the simple act of accepting your child for who they are can, quite literally, be lifesaving,” Nath said. Resources such as the Trevor Project’s Guide to Being an Ally to Transgender and Nonbinary Young Peopleand the National Center for Transgender Equality’s Families for Trans Equalitycan offer valuable best practices on how to support trans and nonbinary young people. Parents of all stripes can take inspiration from Wayans. It doesn’t have to be any more complicated than just loving your child and letting them be their true selves. Take the time as a parent to support and protect your child, offered Ash Orr, a spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality. Speak up if you observe someone being disrespectful to your child because of gender identity and take the time to understand the challenges that trans people of all ages face. “Most importantly,” Orr said, “let your child know that you love and support them, no matter what. It’s amazing for Marlon to model that for other parents out there who may not understand it yet.” Major alert to all parents: It’s OK if you don’t understand your child or what they’re going through. Make that a learning moment to grow in your understanding and not an excuse to shut down or impose value judgments that might be more harmful than helpful. “Marlon’s journey of going from ignorance and denial to complete unconditional love and acceptance is one that resonates with me,” said PFLAG’s board chair, Susan Thronson, the first parent of a transgender person to serve as chair of PFLAG National. “I walked that journey and PFLAG was there with education and support every step of the way. Love takes action to learn, and PFLAG is here with education and support in your community and online.” Like Thronson, Wayans came to understand how critical it is for his son and other trans kids to be able to be their true selves. “I want them to be free in spirit, free in thought, free to be themselves,” Wayans said. “The more you know yourself, the more you can govern yourself. The more you live your truth, the happier your existence.” What a beautiful message for all parents.

179,CNN,What you need to know before a ‘tolerance break’ from marijuana use,Madeline Holcombe,"When your tolerance for marijuana goes up, often usage does, too. That’s a problem many regular users of cannabis products are facing, and some are turning to “T-breaks,” or tolerance breaks, in hopes of getting back to the same high at lower doses. Current research, however, isn’t definitive on whether temporarily abstaining effectively works to recalibrate the body for the desired effect, according toan August study. Ohio recently became the24th state to approve legalrecreational marijuana use, joining Minnesota, Delaware and Colorado, among others. Despite the fact that cannabis remains federally illegal, the conversation around safe adult usage is ongoing as voters continue to open access at the state level. With marijuana use putting people at greater risk for bad health outcomes such as heart attack and stroke, reducing usage may sound like a good idea, said Dr. Robert Page, a professor of clinical pharmacy and physical medicine/rehabilitation at the University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Aurora. But T-breaks come with certain risks, especially when it comes to withdrawal symptoms, he said. Page spoke to CNN about tolerance breaks and whether or not they are a sound strategy. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What is a T-break? Dr. Robert Page:This is a hot topic. This is really all over the internet with very limited — I believe maybe one or two —studies. T-breaks are temporary periods of abstinence, and the goal is primarily to reduce tolerance so that you can have a smaller amount of cannabis to achieve the same effect. And from a pharmacologic standpoint, that makes sense. When you overstimulate one receptor, it downregulates, and so therefore, you need higher and higher doses in order to achieve the effect. However, again, there’s not that much data with regard to this (type of break). This is something that is emerging, because the question is, does it reduce poor outcome (such as heart attack and stroke)? And does it lead to hazardous use? CNN: Do you have any concerns about people taking a T-break? Page:Number one is withdrawal. While withdrawal in some of these smaller, observational studies hasn’t been seen, I still worry about it. If you suddenly stop taking a psychotropic medication, you’re going to have withdrawal symptoms, in terms of irritability, you can have nausea, vomiting, nightmares — all these kinds of things. They usually occur the first three days and can last sometimes up to a week or two. When people take a longer break, like six months or longer, that might suggest a reduction in the risk for things likecannabis use disorder, severity and all those aspects. However, my major concern is you could undergo withdrawal, and there are some data to suggest that it could lead to potential cannabis use disorder. That means it’s impacting your life: your work, your family, your responsibilities. CNN: How might going through withdrawals lead to hazardous usage? Page:If someone is going through withdrawals, they may go right back to using — maybe even a higher dose. They may go to vaping or smoking. I always tell people here in Colorado that the combustible forms of cannabis create some of the same kind of metabolites and toxic metabolites that aresimilar to that of nicotine, like smoking tobacco or cigarettes. CNN: How else can people reduce their usage while avoiding withdrawal? Page:There is titration (tapering down the dose), which is highly individual. All these (cannabis plant compounds called)cannabinoids, they stay in your body because they’re fat soluble — so they can stay in your body for up to three to four weeks. Titrating down slowly is the way to go by reducing dosage either in the interval or the frequency. Typically, you will titrate down over a week or two in order to kind of mitigate those effects. However, again, it’s highly individualistic. And if someone’s having bad side effects and needs to go back up on the dose and then even titrate more slowly. Maybe instead of over a week, it’s over two weeks. CNN: What is your most important piece of advice for people who are using marijuana? Page:One of the things that I am really big on from a public health standpoint is transparency, and that is honestly sharing your cannabis use with your health care provider. They’re not there to arrest. They’re providers, they’re there to help. Having a shared decision-making conversation with regard to this, I think is absolutely critical. Because you need to treat cannabis like you would any other prescription medication. The reality is that if something does happen — coronary syndrome, heart attack or with regard to stroke — then your provider knows the potential ecology that contributes to that. Every day we have at least one admission with a positive urine drug screen for cannabis, and having that conversation is very, very important. I’m not here to judge you. I’m here just to have this open conversation so that you can make an informed decision.","        11:09 AM EST, Wed November 15, 2023",15.0,11.0,2023.0
180,CNN,Justin Sullivan/Getty Images,Samantha Murphy Kelly,"This wasarguably the most momentous week forartificial intelligence since the launch of Chat GPT last year. Open AI unveiled the latest version of the technology that underpins its viral Chat GPT chatbot. Elon Musk announced a sarcastic AI Chat GPT rival called Grokcoming to his platform, X, formerly known as Twitter. There was a Senate subcommittee hearing about AI regulation in the healthcare space, a targeted attack against Open AIand the firstwearable AI devicethat intends to one day replace the smartphone. “These significant announcements are indicative of the speed the AI market is moving at,” said Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research. Hayden noted the week’s development exemplified what’s unfolding in the industry. AI community continues to balance the risk of unintended consequences by moving too fast while moving as quickly as possible to remain competitive and innovative. “Overall, it [was] a huge week,” Hayden added. Here’s a closer look at everything you need to know about the week in AI: Open AI hosted its first developer conference about a year after the launch of Chat GPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. The company unveiled a series of AI tool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of Chat GPT called GPTs. Similar to plugins, GPTs can connect to databases, be used in emails or facilitate e-commerce orders. CEO Sam Altman, in a few minutes, demonstrated how easy it is for anyone to create a GPT without any prior coding experience. The company is also rolling out a GPT Store, starting later this month, to allow GPTs to become searchable. Similar to other app stores, they’ll be listed on a leaderboard, and the company will highlight useful tools across categories such as productivity, education and “just for fun.” Hayden said the announcements, as well as the Apple-like Keynote structure and focus on developers, signaled their intention to “solve their commercial strategic challenges,” which include high costs and limited revenue sources, by building a strong developer ecosystem. Altman also showed off GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of the technology that powers Chat GPT. He said it now can support input that’s equal to about 300 pages of a standard book, about 16 times longer than the previous iteration. Altman shared more about the platform’s growth, too: About 2 million developers now use the platform and about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally. It currently has 100 million active users. Humane, a startup founded by former Apple employees, introduced its first AI wearable device called the Ai Pin, a small blinking gadget that attaches to clothing. It intends to eventually replace smartphones by projecting information onto a user’s hands, offering the ability to answer phone calls and perform various tasks without holding a smartphone. The company said it also features a handful of AI-powered tools, including the ability to search, send messages and manage email clutter. The Ai pin, which runs on a Snapdragon processor and boasts a Qualcomm AI engine, is packed with depth and motion sensors, features an ultra-wide camera and a laser ink display. Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner, said the unveiling marked an “important step in futuristic hardware design for generative and an exploration of a potentially new way of human and machine interaction.” Still, it’s unclear what adoption could look like. Although the company promises an all-day battery, Hayden said the biggest challenge for on-device AI deployment is battery life. “Given that this device is so small and claims to offer multiple different behaviors and use cases and can sense data to inform the model, it will be interesting to see if the battery life is suitable.” Other concerns exist, too: “Always-on AI that collects and processes data will really take a leap of faith from society which at present most are unlikely to take,” Hayden said. The Ai Pin, which starts at $699, will go on sale in the US on Thursday, November 16. x AI said in ablog postit took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams. “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” x AI said in the post. Elon Musk’s AI startup x AI unveiled a chatbot called Grok for some users of X, which he suggested has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own. Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year,said Grok is trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform. Musk said Grok is still in the early stages of testing but will soon come to X’s Premium+ service in the US, which includes features such as the blue checkmark for $16 a month. Musk is a co-founder of Open AI, butstepped downas chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction. Two days after the developer conference, Open AI experienced large-scale outages to its services, which it later attributed to potential targeted attacks on its servers. The companywrote on its website Wednesday evening that it is “dealing with periodic outages due to an abnormal traffic pattern reflective of a DDo S attack.” A DDo S attack, or distributed denial of service, typically refers to an attacker that floods an internet server to disrupt normal traffic. Users on Wednesday were unable to access all of Open AI’s tools and services and received a message that the platform was at capacity. The company told CNN no user information was compromised. Major tech companies continue to double down on AI, too. Reutersreported Amazon is investing millions of dollars on training an AI codenamed “Olympus,” which is expected to have double the amount of “parameters,” or building blocks that make AI smarter than Open AI’s GPT-4 model In addition, You Tube istesting AI toolsthat answers questions about content, makes recommendations and summarizes topics in the comment sections of videos. Chandrasekaran said that while not all companies will create huge AI models, many will continue to build smaller and specific ones to improve their products, automate tasks and gain a competitive edge. - CNN’s Anna Coobin contributed to this report","        4:00 PM EST, Sat November 11, 2023",11.0,11.0,2023.0
181,CNN,"Behold ‘Grok,’ Elon Musk’s AI chatbot with a ‘rebellious’ streak",Anna Cooban,"Brace yourselves. Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own. Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year,announcedlate Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform. Musk’s AI startup, x AI, which developed the bot, said in ablogpostthat it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams. Grok “loves sarcasm,” Musk posted on X. “I have no idea who could have guided it this way.” “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” x AI said in its blogpost. The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said﻿, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States,pay $16 a monthfor features such as theonce-coveted blue checkmark. Grok is intended to rival Chat GPT, an AI chatbotreleasedto the public byits maker Open AI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of Open AI, butstepped downas chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co﻿mpany’s direction. In its blogpost, x AI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of Chat GPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems. “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said. Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse. x AI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October. The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users. British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years afterbeing banned.","        7:27 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
182,CNN,"Open AI unveils latest AI model, customizable GPTs and digital store",Samantha Murphy Kelly,"The technology behind viral AI chatbot Chat GPT just got a whole lot smarter. During its first developer conference held in San Francisco on Monday, Open AI unveiled a series of artificial intelligencetool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of Chat GPT. It is also launching a digital store and cutting base prices for developers while also pledging to pay some who use Open AI products on their platforms. The event comes nearly a year after the launch of Chat GPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. CEO Sam Altman said 2 million developers now use the platform, andabout 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally.Itcurrently has 100 million active users. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, an early partner of Open AI, joined Altman on stage to discuss howhis company continues to infuse GPT technology into its suite of 365 tools. “It’s so different and new,” he said. “I’ve been in the infrastructure business for three decades – and never seen anything like this.” Among the biggest changes announced is the introduction of GPTs, or customized versions of Chat GPT. Similar to plugins, GPT can connect to databases, beused in emails or facilitate e-commerce orders, the company said. On its website, it says GPTs could be used to help with math tutoring, train for a marathon or design stickers, without any prior coding experience. Users can try it out viachatgpt.com/create. “Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data,” the company said in ablog post. Open AI is also rolling out a GPT Store, starting later this month, to allow GPTs to become searchable. Similar to other app stores, they’ll be listed on a leaderboard, and the company will highlight useful tools across categories such as productivity, education and “just for fun.” The company said developers will also be able to earn money based on how many people are using their GPT. Altman also showed off GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of the technology that powers Chat GPT. He said it now can support input that’s equal to about 300 pages of a standard book, about 16 times longer than the previous iteration. The platform will also have expanded knowledge through April 2023 “and continue to improve over time,” Altman said. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” he added. The company also said it is cutting the price for developers, to $0.01 for 1,000 input tokens, which is about three times cheaper than GPT-4. This would allow developers to save on overall costs when running high volumes of information through its systems. Other improvements to the software include more modalities, such as enhanced text-to-speech with a more natural sounding audio with six preset voices to choose from. Altman said Open AI is also doubling down on safety and privacy, noting chats with the tools are not shared with builders. The company also introduced Copyright Shield, which will allow Open AI to step in and defend customers –- and pay costs incurred –- if copyright infringement becomes an issue. Rivals such as Google and Adobe have takena similar approach. “The price and performance improvements, model customization and legal indemnification will have more immediate impact as these capabilities have been sought by developers for awhile now,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner Research. “The autonomous agents will take more time to create an impact but are bold steps ahead for the future of Generative AI.” In the meantime, Open AI emphasized the latest announcements are only part of what’s still ahead. “GPTs will continue to get more useful and smarter, and you’ll eventually be able to let them take on real tasks in the real world,” the company said in the blog post. “We think it’s important to move incrementally towards this future, as it will require careful technical and safety work—and time for society to adapt.

183,CNN,Snapchat isn’t just for teens anymore. Now it needs to make some real money,Clare Duffy,"When Snapchatannouncedlast month that it had reached 5 million paying subscribers for its Snapchat+ service, it seemed like a stunning achievement. The milestone marked the halfway point to the 10 million subscriber number that CEO Evan Spiegel had justmonths earlieridentified as a “medium-term” goal. Theservice’s successin just 15 months after launching proved that despite Snapchat’s reputation as an app used mainly by teens, users are willing to cough up money for a premium experience on the platform. At 5 million subscribers paying $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ is set to earn around $239 million in annual revenue. That subscriber number is just a fraction of its overall user base of Snapchat, which has quietly become one of the world’s fastest-growing social platforms. As of the end of June, it reported 397 million daily active users — more than X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The company’s challenge now is figuring out how to successfully monetize those users to turn around a streak of disappointing financial results. When Snap reports earnings next week for the quarter ended in September, it’s expected to post its third consecutive revenue decline. Despite having invented some of the most important social media features over the past decade — stories and filters — Snapchat is often thought of as an app mainly for young people with less reach and cultuiral relevance than rivals like Tik Tok, Instagram and Facebook. But Snapchat’s user growth suggests that the app remains among the most dominant platforms, even as (and perhaps because) it’s charting a different course from most competitors. As other platforms increasingly lean into discoverability and showing users entertaining content from people they don’t know, Snap remains focused on its longtime strategy of connecting users with their real-life social circle. “At the end of the day, you have a better time connecting with the people you care about most, and we want to make sure that those connections are enduring and that we can provide experiences to enhance them,” Jack Brody, Snapchat’s vice president of product, told CNN. “By focusing on that, we feel like we’re solving problems that real users face every single day, and creating real, differentiated value.” Still, revenue growth hasn’t kept pace with those user gains. In the first six months of this year, Snap’s sales dipped more than 5% compared to the year-ago period, and it posted an operating loss of $769 million. Snap’s (SNAP) shares are down more than 11% since this time last year. The sales declines come as Snapchat, like other platforms, works to update its advertising business to cope with changes to Apple’s app tracking policies. And it comes as the company funnels money into innovations in artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Snap has also faced lawsuits from parents alleging the app contributed to theirchildren’s mental health strugglesor enabled them to buy illicit drugs, with sometimes fatal outcomes. (Snapchat says it has a range of safety features to protect young users, including restrictions on friend suggestions and requests from strangers, default privacy settings and parental oversight options.) Still, analysts say Snap’s user growth continues to represent a major opportunity for the company. “In my view, there’s significant value for a company that’s growing its installed base at this level,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “At the end of the day, when you think about advertisers, they want to go where the eyes are.” Snapchat gained popularity following its 2011 launch for the ability to send disappearing photos to friends, with the option to add silly filters. Two years later, Snapchat launched Stories, where users could share a series of photos and videos to all of their friends that would be viewable for only 24 hours, creating demand for more spontaneous, ephemeral types of content across social media. Since then, Snapchat has continued to expand, adding features like a “Discover” section with public content and the Snap Map, where users can see their friends’ locations and public posts from popular locations. The company has also invested in more ambitious, experimental projects like a selfie drone, which it discontinued followingmass layoffslast year, and AR glasses, investment in which has also beenscaled back. But its core mission is to allow users to have more private conversations with their friends. And that’s fueled an ongoing boom in its user numbers. Snapchat has grown its user base by more than 10% year-over-year for the past 16 consecutive quarters. “That interpersonal and small group focus is really important and appealing especially to younger social media users who don’t want to broadcast their entire lives to mass audiences,” the way they would on Tik Tok or Instagram, said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media platforms and internet popular culture. Snapchat says that much of its daily user base is distinct from other platforms, according to a study of 10,000 users conducted on Snap’s behalf by market research firm GWI during the first half of 2023. The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use Tik Tok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using You Tube on a daily basis. “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake Tik Tok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that Tik Tok saysit has in the United States (although Tik Tok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s Tik Tok banin 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth. Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users. “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any. What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads. “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.” Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted. Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on Tik Tok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, Sensor Tower data shows. But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody. Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base. “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there.

The change comes nearly a monthafter Apple retired its Lightning charger, a milestone moment toward universal charging amid pressure from EU regulators. Like previous models, the third-generation Apple Pencil is intended for taking notes, sketching and marking up documents. It also supports the hover feature, which allows users to preview and switch between different tools and app controls, when used with a 12.9-inch i Pad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) and 11-inch i Pad Pro (4th generation). The price is $79, down $20 from the second-generation Apple Pencil and $50 less than the original. The biggest change to the latest model comes to the charging system, which is noteworthy not only because the company has been resistant to making the switch for years but because it’s about to make charging that much easier for its customers. At its i Phone 15 event in September, the company announced all of its next-generation smartphones and new Air Pods Pro will launch with USB-C charging. Apple previously switched its i Pads and Mac Books to USB-C charging, but the push to finally add it to i Phones came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. In doing so, however, Apple will give up control of its wired charging ecosystem, and identifying good chargers from bad ones won’t be obvious to many consumers. Although Apple does not break out its Pencil sales numbers, David Mc Queen, a director at ABI Research, estimates about 42 million have been sold since it launched in 2015, considering 420 million i Pads have been sold since then (assuming 10% or fewerof these consumers have bought an Apple Pencil). “I’d have to think it’d be this low because of its relatively high price, high-end use case, and the availability of much cheaper alternatives that are capable of working with i Pad,” he said.","        2:09 PM EDT, Wed October 18, 2023",18.0,10.0,2023.0
185,CNN,EU asks Meta for more details on efforts to stop illegal and inaccurate content on Israel-Hamas war,Anna Cooban,"The European Union has told Meta it has a week to explain in greater detail how it is fighting the spread of illegal content and disinformation on its Facebook and Instagram platforms following the attacks across Israel by Hamas. The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm,saidit had sent the formal request for information to Meta (META) Thursday. The commission also asked Tik Tok for more information on the steps it had taken to prevent the spread of “terrorist and violent content and hate speech,” it said, but without referring to the Israel-Hamas war. Last week, EU Commissioner Thierry Breton wrote to several social media companies, including Metaand Tik Tok, giving them 24 hours to detail the measures they were taking to comply with EU rules on content moderation enshrined in the recently enacted Digital Services Act (DSA). On Friday, Metasaidits teams had been working “around the clock” since the attacks by Hamas on October 7 to monitor its platforms and outlined some of its actions against misinformation and content that violates its policies and standards. And on Sunday, Tik Tokannouncedthat it had, among other measures, launched a command center to coordinate the work of its “safety professionals” around the world and improve the software it uses to automatically detect and remove graphic and violent content. But the European Commission has made it clear it needs more information. In its Thursday announcement, the body gave both Meta and Tik Tok until October 25 to respond to its requests and warned that it had the power to impose financial penalties if it was not satisfied with their responses. Both companies also have until November 8 to detail how they intend to protect the “integrity of elections” on their platforms, the commission said. Both Meta and Tik Tok are bound by obligations set out in the DSA, a landmark piece oflegislation, enacted in August, that seeks to more stringently regulate large tech companies, and protect people’s rights online. The commission’s formal requests come a week after it issued asimilar ultimatumto X, the company formerly known as Twitter, asking for information on how it intends to stop the spread of illegal, misleading, violent and hateful content. The commission said it hadopened an investigationinto X’s compliance with the DSA. It has not announced parallel investigations into Meta or Tik Tok.","        12:07 PM EDT, Thu October 19, 2023",19.0,10.0,2023.0
186,CNN,Design by Nichols Architects / Photo by Mike Butler,Unknown,"There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordancherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss. But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t abasketballcourt or hoop in sight. Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts. The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it. For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.” And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994. Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015. With Tiger Woodsheadlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect. A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client. “I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN. “I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.” The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach. Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week. Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players. “I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said. “He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.” Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing. Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta Nationaland the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team. Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style. Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule. The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it. “You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying. Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries“The Last Dance,”and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.” “It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowlertoldthe Subpar podcast in 2020. Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction. “I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said. “It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.” To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal. Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s Shot Link data. The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons. “It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed. Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse. Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto. The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas. “You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said. The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing. Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract. “The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect. “There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’” Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath. Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through. Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagramafter a round at the course in March 2021. Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client. “He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said. “We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.” Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round. When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug. “He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled. “That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic. “He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”","        4:33 AM EDT, Fri September 22, 2023",22.0,9.0,2023.0
187,CNN,Courtesy Scott Wagstaff,Unknown,"Forgolfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death. Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any othergolf clubon the planet: six resident bull sharks. From theirmysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard. A lake on alandlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats. River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks haveorgans specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium. Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s. Neither did severe flooding. Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions includingin 1991, 1995 and 1996. The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters. As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013. Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green. There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast. “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN. “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.” That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010. Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared. The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: theviral You Tube videohas amassed more than 2.3 million views to date. Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor. A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls. Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking. Compared to thecrocodiles and snakes dotting other coursesin the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers,whoretrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on. “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said. Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. Dr. Peter Gausmann publishedhis studyon the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are. Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers. Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013. Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long. One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002. A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented. “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN. “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.” Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown. It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann. Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing. Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way”due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance. Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club. “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said. “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it. “We’d love to see them again.” Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake. Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without itsmascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere. Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks. “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said. “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark. “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”","        4:36 AM EDT, Wed October 18, 2023",18.0,10.0,2023.0
188,CNN,CNN,Unknown,"To most people, the words Swisssport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese. Yet to those familiar with the sprawling countryside and farmlands of the Swiss heartland region where the cheese originated, there’s been a traditional game synonymous with the area for centuries. Sending projectiles hurtling through the air at 200 miles per hour, all rise – and then duck – for Hornussen. Described as a hybrid of baseball andgolf, Hornussen sees two teams of 18 take turns hitting and fielding the “Nouss” or “Hornuss,” a puck named after hornets for its buzzing sound as it whistles through the air.” Armed with a 3-meter (9.84-foot) carbon stick called a “Träf,” hitters take to a raised batting ramp in front of a playing area – the “Ries” – some 300 meters (980 feet) long and 10 meters (32 feet) wide. Their task is to strike the puck from the sloped platform, known as the “Bock,” as far as they can down the field. Scoring starts if they reach the 100-meter line, with an additional point awarded for every 10 meters past the marker. Crucially though, points are only registered if the Nouss lands, with fielders spread at intervals seeking to block the puck from landing with bats, or “Schindels.” The sport’s format has drawn comparisons to golf, with some even suggesting it was a forerunner to the sport’s modern incarnation. “The similarity is that like a ball, you hit a puck, and you hit it far away, but here you want to make some goals, not holes,” said Michael Kummer, member of national championship winning team Hochstetten Hornussen. “People from other countries call Hornussen the ‘Farmer’s Golf’, so I think there’s some similarities.” Yet while in golf only an errant shot is likely to present any danger to others, in Hornussen, putting yourself in harm’s way is an essential part of the game. With pucks of pressed plastic whizzing towards you at speeds akin to an F1 car, stopping them is a feat as treacherous as it is tricky. Though players often wear helmets and shielding gear, some take to the field without any such protection. “It’s really dangerous if you don’t see the Nouss or if one hits the bat and, two meters before the face, the Nouss changes direction,” Kummer explained. “If it goes in the eyes or around the head it’s really dangerous.” Originating in the mid-17th century in the Emmental valley and, barring brief forays into neighboring Germany, Hornussen has never left Switzerland, with few teams existing outside the west-central canton of Bern. The need for vast expanses of open grass to contest games forms part of the reason the sport has been limited to the rural area of Emmental, Kummer explains, adding that ventures into Germany ultimately fell short when teams couldn’t find enough players. Yet for Kummer, it is this very rootedness in Switzerland that makes Hornussen – alongside yodeling and schwingen, a form of wrestling – a pillar of the nation’s sporting culture. “With yodelling and schwingen it’s one of the three culture sports of Switzerland and we like it,” he said. Around 260 teams are active across a multi-league pyramid in Switzerland, with the top teams fighting it out for the Swiss Championship. And as winners of the last five titles, Kummer’s Hochstetten are very much the Bayern Munich of the Hornussen world. With Hochstetten boasting a number of tall, strong players, at first glance it would seem that physical attributes are hugely influential in a team’s performance. Yet Kummer insists that size matters only up to a point. “We have some big guys, but we also have small guys and it’s one of the nice things about this sport,” he said. “The small guys can also make a good play in the field and they can hit the Nouss as long as the big guys.” Take Kumer’ teammate Simon Ernie; though relatively diminutive in stature compared to some of his peers, Ernie was the league’s top scorer during his team’s most recent title winning campaign. “He is the Lionel Messi of Hornussen, and he’s also a small guy,” Kummer said. “He’s one of the smallest on our team.”","        9:47 AM EST, Fri November 17, 2023",17.0,11.0,2023.0
189,CNN,Eddie Adams/AP•Analysis,Unknown,"Hestood6-foot-1, weighed 190 pounds and moved with the grace of an athlete. A sharp dresser who favored linen shirts and stylish ties,Bayard Rustinsported a Clark Gable mustache and adopted a British accent that gave him an even more courtly bearing. There was no civil rights leader who quite looked or spoke like Rustin. He was the Rev. Martin Luther King’s nonviolent spiritualmentor, the chief organizer of the epic 1963 March on Washington and an openly gay Black man who “never apologizedfor who he was, what he believed or who he desired” during an era when homosexuality was seen as a perversion deserving imprisonment. “He looked great on a speaker’s platform,” says Arch Puddington, who worked with Rustin in the early 1970s at a labor organizationthat encouraged Black workers to be more active in unions. “He’d get up and speak to some of these Black audiences and he could really set them on fire,” Puddington told CNN. “And he hardly ever spoke from a text. I would write text for him, and he would just completely ignore it.” The man who organized what was then the largest peacetime protest in American history eventually became known as the movement’s “unsung hero,”largely fading into obscurity by his death in 1987. But now Rustin is returning to the spotlight.  “Rustin,” a biopic that depicts how Rustin navigated a gantlet of personal and political hurdles to pull off the March on Washington, debuts on Netflix today. The film, made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, comes amid a mini-Rustin renaissance. Recent months have also brought a new musical,“Bayard Rustin: Inside Ashland,”and a newbook, “Bayard Rustin: A Legacy of Protest and Politics,” edited by Michael G. Long. The new film is a good introduction to Rustin, and how social change takes place. Directed by George C. Wolfe,it crackles with energy. The actor Colman Domingocaptures much of Rustin’s charisma and shrewd intelligence. The movie also reveals how some of the biggest battles civil rights leaders fought to put on the march were with one another, over turf and ego. Much of the film’s urgency is a result of its tight focus. It’s structured around Rustin’s frantic campaign to organize the march, showing how he and 200 volunteers summoned 250,000 demonstrators to Washington with onlytwo monthsfor planning. They did so during an era of clattering typewriters, landline telephones and mimeograph machines — long before the internet or social media existed. “It was the greatest moment in my life,” Rustin said in an oral history of the civil rights movement called “Voices of Freedom.” It was one of the greatest moments in American history as well. The film, though, offers something more than a history lesson. It offers at least three lessons on leadership and social change. Character, it’s beensaid,is who you are when no one is watching. Rustin’s film, and his life, illustrates that lesson in several ways. The civil rights movement was full of charismatic speakers. Yet many of its greatest leaders defined themselves not by what they said on camera, but by the decisions they made in private. Malcolm X, for example, could fire up a crowd like few others. But his decision to break with Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam,helped seal his greatness. He knew his decision would likely cost him his life, but he was willing to take that chance because of his integrity. King’s decision to oppose the Vietnam War was also widely unpopular. He lost the support of an American president, Black leaders turned against him and donations to the civil rights organization he co-founded dried up. But he did so because, like Malcolm, he shared a core commitment to his integrity. Many pivotal moments in “Rustin,” and in the activist’ life, come down to the same moral calculus. In a tense, private meeting depicted in the film,A. Philip Randolph(magnificently played by actor Glynn Turman) stands up for Rustin when other civil rights leaders tried to get him booted from the march because of his sexual orientation. Rustin earned the respect of people like Randolph and King in part because of what he did when the cameras weren’t turned toward him. He was a pacifist who went to prison during World War II rather than violate his beliefs. He did time on a chain gang and was viciously beaten several times for his activism but refused to retaliate because of his belief in nonviolence. He also spent time in India studying Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence,which he later passed on to King— leading some to call him the“American Gandhi.” Rustin was deeply involved in virtually every major civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century, when many of those movements weren’t popular or covered by the press. “He [Rustin] established a standard for honesty and fortitude that was unusually high in his era and much needed in ours,” Puddington wrote in oneessayabout Rustin. Rustin’s character could also be seen in the way he handled his sexual orientation: no apologies; no double life. During one scene of the film, he tells King he’s not going to hide who he is from other civil rights leaders. “On the day I was born Black, I was also born a homosexual,” he says. “They either believe in freedom and justice for all or they do not.” General Omar Bradley, an American commander during World War II, is known to havesaid: “Amateurs talk strategy and professionals talk logistics.” Bradley’s quote may be apocryphal, but it reflects a truism in warfare. The best-supplied armies often win. Battlefield victories often result not from clever strategies but from logistics — making sure troops have enough supplies and working equipment. The same principle applies in sports. In the NBA, for example, there are certain unglamorous players on championship teams known as “glue guys.”They do the dirty work of setting screens, delivering hard fouls, rebounding and playing defense. Rustin was the “glue guy” leader for the civil rights movement. Every movement needs one. Rustin was a great organizer because he paid attention to details. He knew how many sandwiches and portable bathrooms the March on Washington participants needed. He knew how to raise money, how to charter buses to Washington and how to negotiate with sound engineers to make sure King’s voice could be heard across the Mall when he delivered his climatic “I Have a Dream” speech. Watching Rustin organize the march in the film felt more exciting than the film’s depiction of the march itself. There’s a scene in the movie where Ella Baker, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement who never got her due because of her gender, tells Rustin about the Ying and Yang every movement needs: a person in front and a logistical master behind the scenes. She sees that in Rustin’s partnership with King. “On your own, you and Martin are fine,” she tells Rustin. “But together, you arefire.” The author Rebecca Solnit oncewrote: “Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.” Solnit says some of the biggest enemies of social change are cynicism and pessimism. Opponents of movements often try to convince demonstrators that they have no reason to expect they could win. But Rustin had an ability to inspire marginalized people to believe they could win. One of the best passages in the film shows him molding a group of young, Black, brown and White civil rights activists into the crack team that would organize the March on Washington. Rustin’s exuberance reflected the spirit of his time. He lived in another America full of can-do spirit. The country had defeated fascism during World War II; rebuilt Europe, pledged to send a man to the moon and wipe out poverty with President’s Johnson’s Great Society program. That optimism seeps through the movie. Some of that patriotism may seem naïve now, but it furnished the civil rights movement with tremendous vitality. There are scenes in the film of Rustin mobilizing his young volunteers that conjure memoires of former President Obama’s first campaign, when young people across America bonded together for “hope and change.” At one point in the film, a young organizer proposes a wild idea, and while others shout the person down, Rustin praises the volunteer. “Don’t stifle an impulse before it’s born,” he shouts with a huge smile. Optimism was a core organizing principle for Rustin, says Puddington, who is also a senior scholar emeritus at the Freedom House, a group that defends human rights and promotes democratic change throughout the world. “Bayard was among those rare individuals who believed that if your cause was just and you had access to the basic tools of democracy, your time would come,” Puddington wrote in anessayabout Rustin. “For gay people today who live in democratic settings, Bayard’s optimism has been validated with each new victory for equality.” There is one risk that comes with renewed appreciation of Rustin: It’s easy to short-change his complexity. He’s invariably defined primarily through his sexual orientation – something his enemies often did. But Rustin said his faith as a Quakerwas central to his identity. “My activism did not spring from my being Black,” he oncesaid.“It is rooted fundamentally in my Quaker upbringing.” Rustin said those Quaker values were built “on the concept of a single human family,” and that racial injustice was a challenge to that belief. “It demanded my involvement in the struggle to achieve interracial democracy, “he said, “but it is very likely that I would have been involved had I been a White person with the same philosophy.” Rustin has been called many labels: a greatcivil rights activist,a gay pioneer, an “American Gandhi,” and “Mr. March on Washington.” Maybe it’s time we call simply describe him the way the author Cathy Youngonce didin an essay: As “a great American and a true hero.” John Blake is the author of“More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”","        6:00 AM EST, Sat November 18, 2023",18.0,11.0,2023.0
190,CNN,Hundreds of thousands of galaxies fill a single image taken by new telescope,Ashley Strickland,"The cosmos is filled with unexpected surprises. Observatories such as the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory see the universe in different wavelengths of light, showcasing new details that the human eye would never detect on its own. But when their powerful capabilities are combined, the telescopes can unveil even more celestial mysteries, including theoldest black hole ever foundandcolliding galaxy clustersthat twinkle like a Christmas tree. Meanwhile, missions such as NASA’s Lucy spacecraft are revealing asteroids that would otherwise remain hidden from view. The probe’s cameras shared yet anothernew surprise about what’s orbiting around the space rock Dinkinesh in the main asteroid belt. Also this week, a new telescope opened our eyes to a fresh perspective of the universe. The first five images captured by the Euclid telescope showcase glimmering clusters of galaxies and stars. The telescope, launched in July, was designed to create the most detailed 3D map of the hidden “dark side” of the universe. Though invisible, dark matter and dark energy are both believed to play crucial roles in the structure and expansion of the cosmos. Euclid has a wide field of view, capable of capturing 1,000 galaxies within the Perseus Clusteras well as more than 100,000 additional distant galaxies in the background in a single image. The telescope also shared a dreamy andhighly detailed panoramic view of the Horsehead Nebulawithin the Orion constellation, where young planets may be hiding within the stellar nursery. There is a sleeping giant beneath southern Italy that might be reawakening. A supervolcano left a giant depression called a caldera about 2 million years ago, creating Campi Flegrei, or the Phlegraean Fields, which stretch for miles from the outskirts of Naples to the islands of Capri and Ischia. Campi Flegrei’s last major eruption occurred in 1538, creating a mountain in the Bay of Naples. Intensifying seismic activity has been detected since December 2022.With the possibility of aneruption looming overwhat has become a densely populated region, Campi Flegreimay be Italy’s most dangerous volcanic threat. Colorful holes dug by fish, some playful leaping wolves and a moment where fall meets winter are just some of the winners of The Nature Conservancy’s 2023 Global Photo Contest. The grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Tibor Litauszki, who captured an illuminated underwaterimage of an alpine newt floating on frog eggs. Some of the images show the impacts of the climate crisis and humans intruding upon the natural world. This week, new research suggested that, due to changes in agricultural land use, thousands of plants and animals across Europeface the risk of extinction. In the Southern Hemisphere, scientists are hopeful as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef enters coral spawning season,giving rise to the next generation of corals. Bundles of letters intended for the crew of the French warship Galatée never reached their recipients 265 years ago after the men were captured during the Seven Years’ War.

Space scientist and geologist Farouk El-Baz first proposed in 1981 that if the ancient Egyptians discovered a natural landform called a yardang, they could have added surface details to create the massive limestone statue. Yardangs can take shape when wind sculpts compact sand, and some resemble seated animals, occasionally referred to as “mud lions,” according to Leif Ristroph, an associate professor at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Ristroph and his colleagues set out to recreatethe landscape conditions from about 4,500 years ago and conducted erosion tests on clay-model yardangs. The new research adds evidence to the theory that suggestswind played a role in shaping the sculpture.

191,CNN,The water has turned a shocking shade of magenta in this Hawaii refuge,Unknown,"A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surgedamid an extreme drought. Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue,according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted. While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale. The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria. Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since adeadly wildfire ripped through Lahainain August. Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.","        1:35 PM EST, Fri November 10, 2023",10.0,11.0,2023.0
192,CNN,"China blames Canada for ‘malicious, provocative’ moves after close midair intercepts over South China Sea",Nectar Gan,"China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters. The comments come after CNN revealed last weekthat a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter on October 29, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft. The incident was the second of two “unsafe” encounters the Canadian chopper had on that day with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy J-11 fighters, which got as close as 100 feet (30 meters) from the helicopter, Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN in an interview on the warship. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair briefed reporters on the incidents later Friday, saying the Chinese jets’ actions were deemed to be “significantly unsafe” and put “the safety of all personnel involved in unnecessary risk.” Canada said both incidents took place in international waters within the South China Sea. China’s Defense Ministry hit back on Saturday, accusing Canada of violating Chinese and international laws, jeopardizing China’s sovereignty and security, and conducting “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.” Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said Canada’s HMCS Ottawa frigate flew two helicopter sorties with “unknown intentions” toward China’s airspace around the Xisha Islands – a disputed archipelago claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan and also known as the Paracel Islands. “China’s People’s Liberation Army organized naval and air forces to conduct identification, verification in accordance with the law and issued multiple warnings. However, the Canadian helicopter not only refused to respond, but also took provocative actions such as flying at ultra-low altitudes,” Zhang said in astatementposted on the ministry’s website. “We urge the Canadian side not to ignore the facts, stop exaggerating and hyping up (the incident), and to strictly restrict the actions of its frontline naval and air forces to prevent accidents at sea and in the air,” he added. Millen, the Canadian air commander, told CNN he was piloting the helicopter on October 29, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent. He said he had to descend to 200 feet – an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets” – to end the “unsafe” encounter with Chinese jets. The Chinese fighters flew in circles so close that his helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the jets, which posed a danger to the copter, Millen said. Chinaclaims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea,which is a resource rich and vital international shipping route. Since 2014 Beijing has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. In 2016, aninternational tribunalin The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling and Western powers routinely conduct naval passages through the sea to uphold the claim that it is an international waterway. The latest incidents are the second risky midair intercept Canada has accused China of conducting last month. In mid-October, a Chinese fighter jet came within 5 meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea. That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane. Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane. “The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity maneuvers by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”","        1:27 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
193,CNN,You can rent Martha’s Stewart’s farm guesthouse — for just $11.23,Unknown,"Thanksgiving is closing in. For some people, the holiday piles on the pressure to nail it in the hospitality department. But how can you take your entertaining and hosting prowess to the next level? For starters, you could try to be the one to snag Martha Stewart’s Thanksgiving-Inspired Farm Stay. The upcoming Booking.com vacation listing will be for one night only on the Saturday before Thanksgiving (that’s November 18). Surely the chance to meet Martha Stewart while spending the night in her Bedford, New York, farm’s Tenant House would give you a lifetime of domestic cred. “It’s a charming place right amidst beautiful gardens next to my big original greenhouse,” she told CNN Travel about the standalone, 1,800-square-foot guesthouse with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The Tenant House sits on the property of Stewart’s primary residence, a 153-acre Westchester County farm called Cantitoe Cornersthat she bought in 2000 for a reported $15.2 million. The sprawling estate has several houses and gardens that include analléeof linden trees, topiaries, giant maples and even a hedge maze, according to herblog. “Whoever the lucky couple is, I think they will have a lovely time and be entranced with the charm of Bedford. … the whole township is just beautiful,” Stewart said, adding that the ginkgo trees have just turned golden and fall foliage is currently peaking. In the one-off Booking.com collaboration, would-be guests can try to book the overnight stay on a first-come, first-served basis when the booking window opens at noon ET November 16. The one-night stay comes two days later on November 18. The collaboration with Martha Stewart marks the first time thedomestic doyenneis opening up her guest house to the public this way for a stay, she said. After Stewart’s nieces and other family members enjoyed staying in vacation rentals during travels to places such as Germany, India and the Catskills in New York state, it piqued her own interest, Stewart said. “I’ve been interested in it from an investment standpoint as well as from a personal standpoint,” Stewart said about the kind of vacation rental technology that Booking.com offers in addition to its inventory of hotel stays and other accommodations. This is not the first time Booking.com has worked with celebrities and made their residences available for reservations. Mariah Careyand Sarah Jessica Parkerhave collaborated with the brand, offering stays in a New York City penthouse and Hamptons hideaway, respectively. And Booking has also brought sitcoms such as “The Office” and “Friends” to life via vacation rentals during promotions. Priced at just $11.23 for the night to honor Thanksgiving’s date this year,the farm stay, one of 7.3 million reported listings of homes, apartments and other unique places to stay on the site, can be reserved the same way as any other overnight stay on Booking.com. Just follow the prompts on the site to input your personal details and payment information. “We’re excited to offer this incredible travel experience at Martha Stewart’s iconic farm as one of the amazing home properties on Booking.com that guests can book,” said Angela Cavis, head of communications in North America for Booking.com. For a maximum of two people, the overnight experience includes a full itinerary created by Stewart that’s designed to share her favorite Thanksgiving-inspired and fall traditions. “We have so many experts in our company. And to have a Thanksgiving-inspired weekend for these guests, we thought it would be great,” she said. Stewart said her team is similarly interested in “this kind of hospitality business that Booking.com is involved with.” “It’s so popular now, and we are always avant-garde about new technology and new types of businesses,” she said. Check-in starts at 10 a.m., and guests will kick off their stay with a welcome tour of the “fall-ready” Tenant House as well as a guided tour of the property alongside her head gardener, Ryan Mc Callister. Stops include Stewart’s Instagram-famouschicken coop, home to more than 200 chickens (hard-boiled eggs are among the snacks she often takes along on flights, according to Stewart), as well as the farm’s gardens and stables. Guests can get Thanksgiving-ready for their own celebrations while learning the ins and outs of wreath-making and table-setting skills during a demo with Kevin Sharkey, executive vice president, executive director of design of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Stewart said Sharkey has been with her for more than 28 years and is well-known for his table settings and holiday decorations. For those looking for one-on-one time with Stewart, 82, the highlight of the stay might be brunch with her at her Maple Avenue House on the property, which doubles as the set for her Roku show“Martha Cooks.”The meal will be prepared by James Beard award-winning chef Thomas Joseph,executive vice president, culinary of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. The experience will also include airport transfers through Booking.com, welcome snacks and an off-property lunch and dinner at restaurants recommended by Stewart, including The Inn at Pound Ridge by Jean-Georges, as well as signed copies of her cookbooks, among other goodies. And when you’re ready for some exercise, Stewart suggests county park Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, right down the road from her farm. And she says guests may also enjoy observing the many animals on her property. Images from the Booking.com listing hint at the comforts that await guests at the Tenant House, where they’re in for an inviting if brief getaway (check out is between 11 a.m. and noon November 19). Plenty of windows bring natural light flowing into the cozy cottage, which was the original and first building on the property and dates to 1884. Surrounded by beautiful gardens, it has a kitchen with open shelves, an espresso maker and farmhouse sink and cozy furnishings throughout in mostly neutral tones, with splashes of color. The listing mentions such amenities as free private parking for one car, Wi-Fi, a kitchen, terrace, garden and flat-screen TV and states that children, pets and smoking are not allowed. It’s worth reading “the fine print” at the bottom of the listing before trying to reserve your stay. It states that guests must be 21 or older and will be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement and are subject to security screening before entering the property. Guests are not permitted to prepare their own meals (all meals are provided). As expected in a place where manners matter, guests must “behave as good citizens during their stay and be cooperative with all the staff present on the premises,” according to the listing. For conversation starters with Stewart should you land the stay, you might consider asking about the style of turkey she plans to prepare for Thanksgiving this year (one will be a parchment-wrapped bird, she said) or the new recipe she just developed for a crumb-topped apple pie – an alternative to her famous mile high apple pie. “It’s a delicious, delicious pie and something you could learn to make prior to Thanksgiving,” she said, teasing the recipe that will be posted on Tik Tok and Instagram soon. She may have other tips for your celebration, too. While a perfect holiday “is possible, it doesn’t always happen,” Stewart said. “Have a menu pre-chosen prior to the holidays. You can set the table a week in advance, but make it festive,” she said. “Set yourself a timetable and check it off as you get your tasks accomplished.” The topic of travel is always a good bet for friendly chit-chat with someone who has seen this much of the world, too. Stewart just returned from a trip to Mumbai, India, and is hoping to visit Vietnam soon, with many places still on her list. “My whole travel plan for the next 40 years or so, however long I’ll be traveling, is basically where I haven’t seen yet,” she said. “I’ve been to many, many, many places.  But I’m always curious about places I haven’t been.” Terry Wardis a Florida-based travel writer and freelance journalist in Tampa who has traveled many places but never to Bedford, New York.","        8:02 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
194,CNN,Caster Semenya says taking testosterone-reducing medication was ‘hell’,Bianna Golodryga,"South Africa’s two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenyatold CNN that having to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally was “hell” and had a negative impact on her health. In her new book, “The Race To Be Myself,’ Semenya describes the damaging impact the medication had on her body and now says she wants to use her platform to stop other women having to endure the same thing. “I would say it was hell because each and every day you live under stress,” Semenya told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, speaking about taking the medication. The runner has been at the forefront of controversy. She has been supported by athletes of world renown like tennis great Martina Navratilova but British runner Lynsey Sharp tearfully said how “difficult” it was for her and others to compete against Semenya. Sharp broke down in tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory at the Rio Olympics in 2016. Semenya is hyperandrogenous – meaning she has naturally high levels of testosterone – and is fighting against new rules introduced in 2019 by track and field’s governing body World Athletics (WA) – and previously known as the IAAF – that regulate levels of the hormone in female athletes. In July this year, Semenyawon an appealwhich she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits. “You are not happy within; you are never happy. It makes you feel sick, nauseous. You have panic attacks. It starts creating a little bit of blood clots in your system,” Semenya says. “Your stomach is burning. You eat a lot. You can’t sleep. You sweat a lot each and every day. “It’s like digging a hole that you can never fill up. You know, it’s like you measure a casket and you get in and then you bury yourself. It was not easy. It was a hard time.” In a statement to CNN, World Athletics said it stood by its rules and research. “World Athletics has over a decade of research, directly from DSD athletes in our own sport, that show high testosterone levels do provide an unfair advantage in the female category,” World Athletics said. “The research also shows that the frequency of DSD individuals in the elite athlete population is around 140 times higher than you will find in the general female population. This is why our guidelines on testosterone thresholds are necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to protect the integrity of the female category and have been upheld by two Courts. “If we don’t protect the female category, then women and young girls will not choose sport.” Semenya won the 800m gold medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics Games,but the rules introduced by World Athletics in 2019 meant she would need to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally over distances between 400m and one mile – something she has declined to do. She was unable to defend her 800m crown in Tokyo in 2021 because of the rule changes. Variations in people’s reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male are what is defined as differences in sex development (DSD). It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits – many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits. Semenya acknowledged the differences in her body but insisted DSD athletes did not have an unfair advantage in the sport. “I’m born a woman, but I’m a woman with no uterus. I have no fallopian tubes. I don’t go through menstruation,” Semenya said. “Yes, I’m different, but it doesn’t make me less of a woman.” “I am here where I am because of dedication, hard work, discipline and all those things,” she added. “But then is it considered a threat to a man in sport because, when a woman does great, it becomes a problem. But when a man does good, they’re phenomenal. “But genetically, it’s something that you can say you cannot control it.” Semenya has been locked in a battle with World Athletics – notably with its president Sebastian Coe – for almost a decade over the issue of testosterone regulation and lost appeals against the ruling in both 2019 and 2020. The science on the matter is not entirely conclusive. Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told CNN in 2021 that “there is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” but added that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial.” Semenya, 32, said she felt ready to write a book about her life, but admitted facing questions about her gender at an early age was difficult. In the book, she said she was 18 when she first faced scrutiny from World Athletics, then known as the IAAF. Semenya described the moment as “life-changing.” “You are 18 years of age and then you get asked if you are not woman enough. Your entire childhood you have been a woman, regardless of the differences that you have in your body,” she said. “But I think for me, what I had to turn around was the humiliation, you know, the injustice and people treating me with no respect. “I think the importance for me was knowing who I am, my identity and carrying that to represent my country.” Semenya said she would continue to “advocate for what is right” for women’s sport, proof that one of the most dominant athletes of her time has not turned her back on the sport she loves quite yet.","        10:28 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
195,CNN,Inside Dolly Parton’s new resort lodge in the Tennessee mountains,Unknown,"When a petite blonde with a high hairdo and even higher heels is expected to be in a certain corner of Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains, the devoted start making travel plans. Crowds of people gather, with their necks craned and cell phones held high, seeking recorded proof of this life force with a wide smile and an infectious laugh. A master singer-songwriter, a savvy businesswoman and all-around beloved entertainer who’s not afraid to make a boob joke at her own press conference. That’s the atmosphere Dolly Parton’s presence brings to the Smokies, where she’s just opened her second resort hotel connected to the Dollywood amusement park complex in eastern Tennessee. Her longstanding business partnership with Herschend Family Entertainment, stoked by Parton’s star power, also has anestimated annual direct economic impact of$1.8 billion, and there are plans on the horizon for more Dollywood resorts and attractions to fuel the state’s growing tourism industry. The 302-room Heart Song Lodge & Resort had its grand opening Friday and Parton came out to launch the property, Dolly-style, with some snappy jokes and a few minutes of singing and strumming – verses from 1994’s “Heartsong” – to pay tribute to her rural Tennessee roots that the rustic lodge draws on. Parton’s sparkling, spangled persona doesn’t dominate the resort’s aesthetic, which she called “high-fashion rustic.” But the 77-year-old star herself delivered plenty of glam at the opening, taking the stage in a bold print dress with black ruffles at the hem, black beading draped at the waist and a signature plunging neckline that elicited this quip: “I’m the only person that ever left the Smoky Mountains and took ‘em with her.” But it’s Parton’s warmth and hospitality, not flashy style, that are on display at Heart Song. “I’m just a down-home person and all the people I grew up with are just likable, easygoing people. And I guess once you’ve kind of had that instilled in your whole psyche, in your whole being, that does follow you,” Parton told CNN Travel in an interview after the launch event. Employees across the Dollywood empire greet guests with a smile and are quick to ask how they can help. “When you grow up in a big family, you cater to one another, you cater to your neighbors, you cater to your friends, even on Sundays when the preacher comes over, you’re always kind of giving and we kinda have that spirit (at Dollywood resorts),” said Parton, who grew up rich in music but without material wealth as the fourth of 12 children. It’s Dolly Parton’s childhood in the foothills of east Tennessee that takes center stage here. In the lobby, a four-story stone fireplace has an iron grate with a depiction of a young Dolly among trees and butterflies, while the opposite side features a monumental portrait of the artist. Behind the reception desk, a massive screen rotates through imagery nodding to the current season: in fall, a mama bear and her clumsy cubs, a majestic, blinking owl, and the red, brown and ocher-hued treetops blanketing the mountain crests. The natural world and seasonal changes are captured throughout the hotel. The hallways on the guestroom floors feature artwork tied to the four seasons, while the fireflies that captivated young Dolly appear in the carpeting alongside the concentric rings found in tree trunks, an apt nod to the accumulated experiences of a lifetime. Nearly half of the rooms have balconies so guests can enjoy the mountain air. In the guestrooms, wall-length murals feature either day or nighttime scenes with bears, raccoons and butterflies. There are more than a dozen room and suite types – including a variety of configurations with separate bunk rooms for kids, complete with beds made up with a sleeping bag-sheet hybrid where the covers unzip. Heart Song has Camp DW kids’ crafts and morning reading time drawing upon Parton’s Imagination Libraryeffort promoting reading among young children. There’s an outdoor pool with a waterfall and splash pad as well as a hot tub and an indoor pool. Both pools are lifeguarded. A large firepit hosts evening singalongs, and smaller seating areas with firepits are scattered around the large patio. A wood-burning firepit is home to the resort’s evening “Roasties,” a twist on s’mores. While the lodge is rustic, there’s some subtle shimmer in the lobby and plush, smoky blue velvet sofas. The singer’s sparkly aesthetic is on display in Heart Song’s separate Acoustic Lobby, a pink-and-purple space that’s offered for private dining. Here, there’s a chandelier of acoustic guitars and displays of Parton’s dazzling outfits. When it’s not in use as a private space, guests are invited to enjoy the room. There’s a grab-and-go market, and the primary restaurant, Ember & Elm, serves a la carte breakfast and dinner featuring Southern classics (the biscuits served with local jams are addictive). The adjacent High Note is a more casual restaurant/bar with all-day dining. Heart Song follows Dollywood’s first hotel, Dream More Resort and Spa, which opened nearby in 2015. That property has a more feminine feel, complete with a spa and salon. Peak season rates at the new Heart Song Lodge start at $319. Peak-season Dream More rates start at $269. Rates are typically lower in January and February when the theme park is closed. Parton’s music, kindness and down-home charm inspire legions of fans, many of whom become loyal customers. Some made pilgrimages to Pigeon Forge for the resort’s opening – and, they hoped, to catch a glimpse of their idol. Allen Jones drove seven hours from Dothan, Alabama – something he’s done dozens of times as a Dollywood season-passholder. He used to come with family members who have since died, but over the years he’s befriended other avid Parton fans from around the country, and they often meet up here. “They’re my family now,” said Jones, 54, sitting in the hotel lobby wearing a T-shirt that read, “Everyone has their addiction. Mine just happens to be Dolly Parton.” Jones saw Parton twice on Friday – during her press event in the morning and as she left Heart Song for the day. Carol Malerbi made a pilgrimage to Dollywood from New Hampshire in the hopes of seeing Parton, whose music was played for her while she was in a two-month coma about a decade ago due to complications from diabetes. “I just love her, I love her inspiration,” she said, alongside her husband Jim, who made a cutting board for Parton bearing an eagle and a butterfly. The couple gave it to Heart Song staff in the hopes that it would make it to Parton. It was their first trip to Dollywood, and they timed it with the hopes of seeing the star, which they did for “two seconds” as Parton made her way out of the hotel Friday evening. Autumn Martin, wearing a pink Dolly sweatshirt, was enjoying her first visit to Heart Song with her husband, their 8-year-old son and her husband’s parents. The elementary school teacher from Marietta, Georgia, is such a Parton fan that she’s incorporated the singer’s music and message into her teaching. “My whole classroom is Dolly-themed,” she said. Each year Martin and her kindergarten class stage a year-end production of Dolly Parton songs, with some tweaked lyrics (“9 to 5” becomes “8 to 3” to better align with her school’s hours). “We love the sparkles and the glitter. But it’s really about being kind,” she said when asked about Parton’s influence. “She teaches us to care for everybody. She embodies a genuine goodness. It’s something I want the kids to emulate.” For some fans, visiting Dollywood – and the prospect of spotting Dolly herself on an occasion like Heart Song’s opening – is a near-religious experience. One excited young boy claimed to have caught a glimpse of the superstar herself Friday as he peered into a room off the resort lobby. The woman beside him said, “I wish you cared this much about God.” Parton’s enduring appeal translated to more than three million Dollywood visitors last year, making it the state’s largest ticketed attraction. Sevier County – home to Sevierville, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg – generated nearly $3.8 billion in visitor spending in 2022, putting it third behind Davidson County, where Nashville is located, and Shelby County, home to Memphis, according to the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development (TDTD). That figure is up 53% from pre-pandemic, 2018 figures. “Out of the top 40 tourism states in America, we’re the fastest growing state in the last five years in terms of visitor spending,” Mark Ezell, TDTD’s commissioner, told CNN Travel. Dolly Parton’s impact on the state is “profound, and it keeps on growing,” said Ezell, who called Parton “our second first lady of Tennessee.” And Heart Song Lodge is just 10 miles north of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most-visited national park in the US. Heart Song also has 26,000 square feet of event space. With Dollywood closed for two months during the winter, the lodge included that space to increase business, particularly during that period, said Kevin Osborn, Heart Song’s general manager. All this, of course, started with a theme park. Three other parks called the site home before Dolly Parton’s involvement turned it into Dollywood. The original park, Rebel Railroad, dates back to 1961. It was followed by Gold Rush Junction and Silver Dollar City, whose owners, Jack and Pete Herschend, joined forces with Parton in the 1980s. On May 3, 1986, Dollywood opened, more than doubling attendance over the previous season. For the uninitiated, in addition to roller coasters, rides and live entertainment, Dollywood features a replica of Parton’s childhood Tennessee mountain home, a two-room cabin that gives visitors a sense of her modest roots. The park also holds a bald eagle sanctuary, where more than a dozen non-releasable birds live in a wooded enclosure. Many additions and updates have followed, leading up to the $25 million Big Bear Mountain roller coaster that opened in May. And for die-hard Dolly fans, there’s more to come. The Dolly Parton Experience, a complete revamp of the former Chasing Rainbows Museum and several other nearby buildings, is expected to open in May 2024. It will offer interactive highlights of Parton’s life and covers her TV shows, movies, her many duets and her beloved Imagination Library, which gives free books to children. Another building will contain “Behind the Seams,” showcasing her performance outfits, wigs and more. Visitors also will be able to board one of her former tour buses, removed from the park right now during the renovations, to see how their idol crisscrossed the country. Over time, the company plans to add three more resorts, including an upscale RV experience outlooked for 2026, according to Eugene Naughton, president of The Dollywood Company. And Dream More is planning a décor refresh for 2024. “You know every few years I get a little facelift, a little nip and tuck myself,” Parton said at the press event, adding that “it’s only right” that her hotels should do the same. All of these attractions, just a few miles from where Parton grew up, just add to the destination’s expanding tourism offerings. “I’m so proud of every business, every hotel, every motel – all the people around here,” she said, “because this is my home.” CNN’s Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","        11:51 AM EST, Sun November 5, 2023",5.0,11.0,2023.0
196,CNN,"CNN Exclusive Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says",Brad Lendon,"A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft. “The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying. The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship. He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter. The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time. The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said. Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent. In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter. “When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said. His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said. “I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said. Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.” The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea. Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.” “We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.” CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment. Chinaclaims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea,and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island. The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend. In 2016, aninternational tribunalin The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling. Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire. The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets. The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tenseencounters between PLA and allied vessels. Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident. Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore. “They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships. Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China. “Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?” This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported. Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days. On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said. And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea. That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane. Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane. “The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.” In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels. Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilotsagainst US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that. “Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”","        1:00 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
197,CNN,"Mosquitoes are driving these birds to extinction. With only 5 left in the wild, scientists are racing to save the species",Unknown,"The ‘akikiki, a small, gray bird native to Hawaii, may not look remarkable, but its rarity is. Only five are thought to remain in the wild and, according to the state’s Department of Land and Natural Resources, the species could go extinct within months. The biggest threat to the tiny birds is from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Living in the cool and lush mountains of the island of Kauaʻi, for many years this honeycreeper specieswas out of the range of non-native mosquitoes, but rising temperatures from climate change have enabled the biting insects to find their way up to these peaks – with terrible consequences. “The populations have basically taken a nosedive over the last 15 to 20 years as the climate has changed and mosquitoes are going higher and higher in elevation,” says Hannah Bailey, wildlife care manager of the Hawaii Endangered Forest Bird Conservation Program for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. With no resistance to mosquito-borne diseases, the birds are falling victim to avian malaria, which “is almost always fatal to most of the small honeyeater adults,” she explains. With populations at an all-time low, conservationists like Bailey, along with the Kauaʻi Forest Bird Recovery Project and Department of Land and Natural Resources, are ramping up efforts to save the species from extinction by building up an insurance population in bird conservation centers on Kauaʻi and Maui islands. (The center was not affected by recentwildfires that devastated Maui.) “Our mission is to provide safe haven populations of the species that are in peril, so that when the environment is right for them to survive long-term, we’ll be able to re-release them,” she says. Recently the team hasshifted from looking to capturethe handful of remaining birds and bring them to safety, to focusing entirely on collecting unhatched eggs. Each nesting season, the team heads to Kauaʻi’s mountainous plateaus and, knowing where nests have previously been spotted, searches the top of ʻŌhiʻa trees using a camera mounted on a long pole. When they find an occupied nest, they rig up a ladder system, sometimes climbingas high as 48 feet (14 meters)to reach it. This summer, the team successfully rescued 10 eggs that were placed in a portable incubator and brought safely back to the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center. There, collected eggs continue to grow and develop, and any successful hatchlings join the other 50 or so ’akikiki in human care. The rescued birds will live in enclosures that are carefully designed to mimic their natural habitat while protecting them from mosquitoes, and human interaction is strictly limited so that the birds maintain their natural behavior, says Bailey. The goal is that as soon as the threat of avian malaria is eradicated, the birds can be released back into their native habitat. “(It’s the) best chance for survival and raising these young chicks hopefully will give us the next generation of ‘akikiki,” she says. The looming challenge is how to eradicate avian malaria – which not only threatens the ‘akikiki but also other endangered forest birds. Historically, there were more than50 honeycreeper species in Hawaii, songbirds that feed on nectar and insects, but today there are just 17, as populations have been decimated by mosquito-borne diseases, as well as loss of habitat and threats from other invasive species. In June, the US governmentcommitted nearly $16 millionas part of an initiative to prevent the imminent extinction of Hawaiian forest birds. This includes funding focused on expanding captive care programs and efforts to control and eradicate invasive mosquitoes. Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources is currently waiting for approval from regulators to implement “incompatible insect technique (IIT)” which involves releasing male mosquitoes that have a strain of naturally occurring bacteria called Wolbachia, which causes non-viable eggs and offspring when they mate with wild females. The process could help to reduce the likelihood of forest birds being affected by avian malaria, which is only carried by female mosquitoes. But until this happens, the focus must be on growing the populations and maintaining a stable genetic variety, says Bailey. “Our biggest hope is that our center is no longer needed, that we have landscape level control of mosquitoes in avian malaria and can control other threats so that these birds can be released back into the wild and live in their native habitat,” she says.","        4:25 AM EST, Mon November 6, 2023",6.0,11.0,2023.0
198,Business Insider,"Politics Rosalynn Carter, former first lady of the United States, dead at 96Rosalynn Carter died Sunday at 96 at home in Plains, Georgia, where her husband, former president Jimmy Carter, has been in hospice care.",Sebastian Cahill,"       Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady of the United States, died Sunday at 96. After a brief period in hospice, announced on November 17, Carter died at home surrounded by friends, family, and her husband, former President Jimmy Carter. Earlier this year, the Carter Center announced that Carter had beendiagnosed with dementia. Carter lived a long and successful life alongside her husband, whom she knew almost her entire life. She first met Jimmy Carter when she was a baby, and they married in 1946 in their hometown of Plains, Georgia. They were married for 77 years, thelongest marriage of any presidential couple. ""The best thing I ever did was marrying Rosalynn,"" Jimmy Carter said in a 2015interview with The Carter Center. ""That's the pinnacle of my life."" Carter was instrumental to her husband's success in both business and politics — he frequently turned to her for advice. When Jimmy Carter was first elected governor of Georgia, Rosalynn Carter turned her focus to helping people in the state with mental-health issues on the Governor's Commission to Improve Services to the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. Later, when Jimmy Carter announced his candidacy for president, he said his wife was ""much more political"" than him, while the White House website credits her for helping her husband throughher strong belief in his abilities. As first lady, she again focused on mental-health advocacy. As the honorary chair of the President's Commission on Mental Health, she oversaw a group dedicated to enacting policy change for people with mental illness. After Jimmy Carter lost his reelection bid, he and Rosalynn returned to Georgia and founded The Carter Center in Atlanta in 1982. The Carter Center has since monitored elections for democracy worldwide and almost entirelywiped out the Guinea-worm disease. In the mid-1980s, the couple began collaborating with Habitat for Humanity, where they worked to build and repair more than 4,300 homes with the group. Despite her political responsibilities, she remained focused on her family. She hasfour children and 22 grandchildren with Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter, now 99 and thelongest-lived US president, has been in hospice care since February. He's been enjoyingpeanut-butter ice creamand has said he's ""at ease with death."" The couple's grandson, Jason Carter,said in a recent interviewthat his grandparents have enjoyed spending their ""last chapter"" together at home, celebrating their longevity, their family, and their love in the same tiny Georgia town they both were born in. ""That word love is really the one that defines certainly their personal relationship, but also the way they approach this world,"" Jason Carter, now the chair of The Carter Center's governing board, said.

199,Business Insider,"Tech See inside Nvidia's giant 'Voyager' HQ — a futuristic office where work meets nature Nvidia's enormous headquarters at Santa Clara, California features parks and treehouses. And yes, it was named after a ""Star Trek"" starship.",Polly Thompson,"       Nvidia has had a big few years. Demand for the company's GPU chips surged as artificial intelligence fever swept the world. Nvidia latched onto the AI trend early, and it was able to carve out a significant lead in producing chips used in flourishing technologies such as Chat GPT. The company'svaluation quickly soar to $1.2 trillion, up almost250% this year. One of the keys to Nvidia's success could lie in its flat organizational structure. ""When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,"" CEO Jensen Huang said ina recent interviewwith Harvard Business Review. Nvidia has fully committed to the flat structure — removing three or four layers of management in an effort to operate as efficiently as possible, Huang said. Another key to the company's ""no barriers and no boundaries"" approach, as Huang described it, is its office. Opened in early 2022, the Santa Clara headquarters is an imposing 750,000-square-foot structure designed to enhance employees' performance in line with the company's vision. Named ""Voyager,"" the building was designed by the architectural firm Gensler – and yes, it was named after a ""Star Trek"" starship. Hao Ko, the design principal on the project, told Business Insider that the idea for the office ""is rooted in that idea that people do their best work when they are provided with a choice."" From individual places designed to enhance work focus, mentorship, or in-person meetings, the office provides employees with a wide variety of spaces to suit their individual needs. ""A successful workplace needs to be a destination and not an obligation, so designing a comfortable place that reflects a company's culture is also very important,"" Ko said. Ko said his firm's research showed collaboration was most effective when teams operated in the same spaces. ""The pandemic highlighted that work can happen anywhere, but it also reminded us that bringing people together inspires them to do their best work,"" he said. Engineers at Nvidia had previously been siloed in traditional workstations, while other teams were stationed on different floors and even in different buildings. Gensler's solution was to move all Nvidia's teams into one big room. But the team faced certain issues with regards to sound and light in such a vast open space. ""We designed the shape of the roof to bounce sound without reverberation and selected the ceiling material to help absorb noise,"" Ko said. ""Driving natural daylight evenly into a large space for all people to enjoy is also a challenge. We solved it by adding an abundance of skylights on the roof, moving people closer to the building's glass façade, and terracing the large floor plates,"" he added. They also wanted to provide a connection to nature in the space, Ko said, adding that the true innovation of the Voyager office is how the interior environment makes it feel like you're working outside. ""Inspired by the fact Santa Clara has arguably one of the best climates in the world and that our backyards are an extension of our home lives, Nvidia challenged our team to create a workplace that harnessed the beauty and inspiration of the surrounding nature and allowed people to work outdoors all day,"" he said. The ""four-acre workspace"" features parks and '""treehouses"" for gatherings, while shading trellis lined with solar panels blends into the building's structure. The company also uses geographical nicknames to describe different areas in the building. The ""mountain"" stairway leads to upper levels with lab spaces, while along its perimeter are ""valleys"" — naturally lit corridors that provide intimate meeting spaces and eating areas. Ko said that future workspaces will put a greater emphasis on offering people variety to choose where they work and to push for healthier and more comfortable environments. ""By refining the design of the workplace based on how people use it, we will continue to drive more innovation and a more resilient future,"" he believes.

Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying that the boat was ""hijacked on an Iranian whim by the Houthi militia in Yemen,""The Times of Israelreported. ""This is another act of Iranian terrorism which expresses a leap forward in Iran's aggression against the citizens of the free world, and creates international implications regarding the security of global shipping lanes,"" the statement said. The Israel Defense Forcessaid in a statementthat it was not an Israeli ship, adding that the incident was ""a very grave incident of global consequence."" Netanyahu's office's statement said that there were no Israelis on the ship, but there were 25 crew members from countries including Ukraine, Bulgaria, the Philippines, and Mexico. On Sunday, a spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, Yahya Sare'e, threatened Israeli vessels in the Red Sea""in solidarity with Palestinian people in the wake of the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza."" He said this would include ships ""carrying the flag of the Zionist entity"" and ones operated by and owned by Israeli companies. The International Maritime Security Construct, a global coalition working to maintain safety in regional waters,advised ships to avoid Yemeni watersand travel at night when possible. The Houthis are an Islamist political and armed organization who analysts say have ties to Iran. They have been battling against the Yemeni military for more than a decade.

201,Business Insider,Economy Millennial and Gen Z parents are struggling,Juliana Kaplan,"       Kyle Taylor doesn't have a village. The Alabama-based 26-year-old and his girlfriend were delighted when their daughter was born a year ago, but nowadays they are feeling a bit lost. To make ends meet, Taylor has been spending a lot of time at work. And while his girlfriend stays at home, Taylor's schedule and the needs of the baby have left them stretched thin. But none of Taylor's friends are parents, and most don't plan on having kids, leaving them unsure how to chip in with a newborn. Growing up, Taylor always heard about the proverbial village it takes to raise a child. Now that he actually has one, he realizes there is no village anymore. ""There's already this kind of disconnect for us. People aren't thinking in terms of like, how can I support my friend?"" he said. ""Rather, I think they're just kind of grateful that they're not in my situation of having someone to care for."" Millennial and Gen Z parents are finding themselves isolated. Maybe they'vemoved away from their familyin search of a well-paying job or cheaper rent. When parents are close by, they're often still working and don't have time to pitch in with childcare. Outside the family tree, many of their peers either can't afford or are choosing not to have kids, making it harder for them to understand what their new-parent friends are dealing with. And raising children is becoming increasingly expensive, adding an economic weight to their worries. ""We've been left with kind of a wreckage of an economy here in the states. It's tough,"" he told me. ""It's really, really tough living paycheck to paycheck, like most people, and not really getting a whole lot of support or feeling like people my age really understand."" The new paradigm of parenthood is made up of a series of impossible decisions: leaving jobs, moving away from friends or families, or working longer hours to make ends meet. Natalie Groff, a 33-year-old mother of four, summed up her cohort's dilemma succinctly: ""The way things are right now, it's pretty messed up and the odds are definitely stacked against us."" Millennials have spent the past two decadestrying to find their economic footing— two recessions, a college-debt crisis, a pandemic, and the worst labor market in a half-century didn't make it easy. But they and Gen Zers behind them have finally caught up to previous generations in terms of their income, Jean Twenge, a psychologist and the author of ""Generations: The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents—and What They Mean for America's Future,"" told me. ""The good news is that median incomes for younger adults are at all-time highs, even when adjusted for inflation,"" Twenge said. ""And that's partially because more millennials and Gen Zers went to college and got a college degree, and folks who get those degrees make more money."" But while their incomes have climbed, the price of all kinds of child-rearing essentials has skyrocketed even higher. The cost of childcare has tripled since 1991, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and research by economists at Bank of America found that the average family was spending over $700 a month on care as of September, a figure 32% higher than in 2019. Even as childcare workers grapple with low pay andtough conditions, a report from the Department of Labor found that the precarious system ofunderfunded childcare— which relies on ""overburdened families and underpaid childcare workers"" — meant that childcare isunaffordable almost everywhere in the US. ""Childcare prices are untenable for families across all care types, age groups, and county population sizes,"" the report, released in January, said. Childcare isn't even the start of increasingly expensive child-rearing expenses. Since 1997, the price of baby food and formula has more thandoubled, with Nielsen IQdata showing the price of diapers rising by almost 22% from 2018 to 2022 alone. As fast as the money comes in from the pay raises that millennials and Gen Zers have secured, for parents the money goes right back out. That may explain why the younger generations are falling behind on their debt payments. America's 18- to 29-year-olds are seeing about twice as much debt going into serious delinquency compared with those ages 50 to 59 and 60 to 69. These realities can force many millennial and Gen Z parents to make tough choices. Most of the income gains made by young people, Twenge said, have come from women's salaries. More women are graduating from college and seeing their incomes start to catch up. But that can be a double-edged sword for young heterosexual couples: It doesn't make sense to forgo either parent's high salary, so they have to wrangle incredibly expensive childcare instead. A family in New York City with just one young child, for instance,would have to make $300,000 a yearfor their childcare costs to meet federal affordability standards. And the longer-term boom in women's career opportunities means the mothers and grandmothers who might have previously been available to pitch in care are no longer available, because they're working. Take Groff, the mother of four: When her old workplace shuttered, she became a stay-at-home parent again, which alleviated the cost of after-school care. The savings were so significant that when a supervisor job opportunity came up, the salary wouldn't be enough to break even for the cost of childcare. So she's once again working as a stay-at-home mom while studying for a master's degree. ""In some ways, it was very comforting to come back home,"" she said. ""But in other ways it's just like, OK, I know this is what I can do for my family at this time, but I almost have this master's degree — and when am I going to use it?"" Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat from California who helped found the Congressional Dads Caucus, knows these struggles personally. Gomez is the father of a 13-month-old whobriefly went viralin January after being pictured strapped onto his father's chest during the first chaotic round of House Speaker votes. Gomez told me that what we're seeing right now ""is just a ton of pressure on parents when it comes to making ends meet."" He's not exempt from that pressure — his family is paying nearly $2,700 a month for just three days of childcare a week. At the same time, Gomez added, theaverage American family that rents their home is now considered rent-burdened, meaning they spend at least 30% of their income on housing. Between childcare and rent, two major expenses can easily eat up over half of a family's income. ""That means less money for a 401(k), savings, college, starting a small business, repairs to your house. Just the basic stuff becomes more and more difficult,"" he said. ""So the stress is real, especially for Gen Z and millennials."" Taylor, the Gen Z parent, said he understood this problem deeply. After the birth of his daughter, his job and salary didn't really change, but his expenses did. He says his family is living paycheck to paycheck and just ""hemorrhaging money."" ""I have a fairly decent job. It would be good for a single person with no kids,"" he said, adding that there was ""just no disposable income, basically, between rent and groceries."" Beyond the financial pressures of modern parenting, there is also another fundamental problem: isolation. The kinds of places that encouraged community and allowed young parents to meet one anotherhave been disappearing, especially as suburbs — renowned for their sprawl —see more Gen Zers and millennials moving in. And even the definition of a ""young parent"" is changing: In 1990, the median mother in the US had her first child at age 27; as of 2019,that age had risen to 30. Just look at one proxy for a lost village: how often kids are walking to school. It's become a familiar joking refrain that, back in the day, everyone would make their hikes to school. But there's truth to that. The share of kids usually walking and biking to school has fallen — from48% in 1969to about10% in 2017. By 2017, about 54% of kids were traveling to school in private vehicles, with bus transport coming in at a distant second at 33.2%. At the same time, over half of Americanslived in childcare deserts as of 2018, areas where the number of children outnumbered licensed care slots by at least three to one — meaning that parents have to go farther, or pay more, or stay home to access care. And, as of 2018, just 16% of Americans in a Pew Research Centersurvey reported feeling very attached to their communities. Younger Americans seemed particularly detached, with just 8% of 18- to 29-year-olds saying they were very attached to their local community, and 13% of those ages 30 to 49 saying the same. This increasing sense of isolation is seeping across society even though Gen Zers and millennials want to be near one another and the things that they enjoy. An April survey of 2,000 urban adults from the National Association of Realtorsfound nearly half of millennials said they considered living in a walkable community to be very important, with both Gen Zers and millennials saying they'd rather live closer to public transit than a highway. Millennials with kids said they'd happily trade a smaller yard for a walkable community, and both cohorts said they'd pay more to live in a walkable community. But, at the same time, young parents are fleeing those walkable cities for thetowns next door. With the rise of remote work — which has been a boon for care-strapped parents, but not so much for us ashumans who need socialization— the cheaper suburbs and exurbs make sense for cash-strapped parents. The lack of support is even beginning to factor into young people's decisions on whether to have a family at all. Over half of Gen Z and 47% of millennials surveyed by Deloitte in late 2022saidthey expected starting a family to become harder — or outright impossible. This hopelessness has reinforced the dissipation of the village. Since younger parents are now ""the exception rather than the rule,"" Twenge said, the share of people with peers going through the same stage of parenting has shrunk. Over the past few years, the birth rate among 40- to 45-year-olds has slowly been ticking up; it's even more pronounced for those ages 35 to 39. At the same time, the birth rates for those ages 20 to 34 have all fallen. Recently, Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, a Democratic millennial who has a young kid, was able to experience the type of village that is all too rare these days. When she visited a friend's house, the houses were clustered around a communal area with a playground, grass, and tables where kids could go play. ""People come out and bring their food out and help each other watch their kids,"" she said. It was a simple reality, but one that showed the way that things could be. ""We just have to rethink the many ways in which we've made this much more difficult,"" Pettersen told me. Her generation, she said, is dealing with ""so many of the failed policies"" that have led to a village like that feeling out of reach. So why are these physical villages so rare? Pettersen blames failed tax policies: ""When we continue to cut taxes for the most wealthy and we don't reinvest back in communities for the critical services to level the playing field for regular people, we just continue to see this opportunity gap increasing."" For generations that are already spending less time with others — and are experiencing higher rates of depression, coupled withfun activities becoming increasingly financially out of reach— the lack of a peer cohort of parents may be another social blow. ""They are spending less time with people face to face, and that can be tough when you're entering parenthood,"" Twenge said. In speaking with parents, lawmakers, and experts, one thing became clear about the state of parenthood in America: It's becoming a decision that's turned from a normal progression of life into a thicket of difficult choices. Many are opting out of having kids altogether, creating a different type of void. Tumbling birth ratesmight spell future economic disaster for America. It also means those who are having kids are feeling more isolated, standing alone on a costly, shrinking island. ""​​It was so financially impossible"" to think about becoming a parent, Pettersen said. And yet, there she is. She's still trying to figure out how to balance everything, ""but we don't make it easy for parents, and we don't have that community support and those community connections previous generations did."" That's not to say there aren't policy solutions: Rep. Becca Balint, a Democrat from Vermont, didn't have her first kid until she was about 39. She said policies like the child tax credit and lowering student-loan burdens — alongside investing in affordable housing and childcare — could help address some parental challenges. ""All of those expenses that we are able to stabilize make it easier for young families, and it takes off that incredible stress and anxiety that you feel, and loneliness when you feel like, I'm working as hard as I can and I can't seem to get on top of things,"" Balint said. It used to be the case, Pettersen said, that each generation in America would have it better than the last. That's no longer true. Until the 1970s, it would take thetypical American family23 years to double their incomes — once a generation. As of 2021, ittakes over 100 years. Even with the economic struggles that come alongside it, Taylor has found parenthood to be transformative. He says it makes him think on a daily basis about what other people are going through, and to offer them more grace. Raising a young human is difficult. ""I love that sense of connectedness that I get with other parents, people I see in public, even if I don't know them,"" he said. Of course, Taylor respects anyone who's decided that parenthood isn't for them. Broadly, he thinks our economic system is incompatible with giving people the true support they need. ""If you desperately want to have a child or children, to raise a family — such an innate desire in so many people — you should have the chance to,"" Taylor said, ""and life should be such that you shouldn't have to count yourself out.""

202,Business Insider,Tech The biggest potential loser of the Open AI fiasco wasn't Sam Altman. It was Satya Nadella.,Julie Bort,"       If Sam Altman can't be convinced to return to Open AI, Microsoft is in trouble. As soon as Altman's ouster from the company he co-founded shocked the tech industry on Friday, VCs were, no doubt, formulating plans to write checks for his next venture, asthe memes on X joked. Prominent VC Vinod Khosla saidas much on X. ""To be clear, Khosla Ventures wants @sama back at @Open AI but will back him in whatever he does next,"" he posted. Should that next venture be a generative AI startup that competes with Open AI and has no qualms about pursuing commercial success (a likely choice!), Altman would also have no trouble poaching the brightest minds from Open AI. His cofounder, Greg Brockman,immediately quit in protest of Altman's removal, asdid three senior researchers. More staffers were threatening to resign if Altman wasn't reinstated, the Verge reported. And Altman called to themwith a post on Xof his appreciation, ""i love the openai team so much."" Does he love them enough to hire them for a new venture that would be swimming in venture cash? As that's how so many startups launch— by hiring people from the last company — I'm going to say yes. All of which means that the biggest loser if Altman can't be convinced to return isn't Altman. And it isn't Open AI employees. It's Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella. ""Open AI is like Mahomes to the Chiefs. Nadella recognizes this and losing Sam is not an option. This Open AI board is way over its head and the failed coup is now backfiring,"" investor Dan Ives, an analyst at Webush, told Business Insider. Microsoft has investeda reported $10+ billion dollarsand owns a sizeable stake — some reportssay as much as 49%— in a for-profit unit run by the non-profit Open AI. (Although Microsoft has never publicly confirmed the size of that stake.) The Open AI non-profit was run by a six-person governing board who owned no equity and included Altman and Brockman. So a simple majority vote was all it took to fire Altman and install CTO Mira Murati as interim CEO. Open AI onlygave Microsoft a few minutes advance warningbefore announcing Altman's ouster, sources told Business Insider. The company has, publicly at least, stood by the board's decision. ""We have a long-term agreement with Open AI with full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and an exciting product roadmap; and remain committed to our partnership, and to Mira and the team,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. Until Friday, Microsoft's deal with Open AI was a major coup for Nadella, giving Microsoft deep access to the technology at the center of AI, while preventing its competitors from doing the same. But should Altman refuse to return and instead form a new AI startup, he cancertainly easily fill it with the peoplewho know the secrets of Open AI technology. And he's also likely to seek another cloud investor/partner. Generative AI needs massive, specialized compute power to perform, especially to perform for millions of customers. Google or Amazon would almost certainly try to make Altman a deal he couldn't refuse. It would be much safer for Nadella to pressure Open AI into getting Altman to come back. ""The biggest worry is the Altman sweepstakes end up in the Google or Amazon backyard which would be a nightmare for Microsoft,"" Ives wrote in a research note. But it's not just the money invested, and the gains of that investment, that would be lost for Microsoft. Microsoft has been baking Open AI technology into pretty much all of its major products, andbeating its rivals to market. Earlier this month the company made over100 announcements of integrations with Open AI tech across Microsoft's AI tools, AI models, tools in its cloud, the company told Business Insider. It put Copilot — its chat assistant based on GPT — everywhere. But Microsoft has also been making cuts, or outright winding down, various other internal homegrown AI projects to lean into Open AI tech, sources have told Business Insider. It shutdown various ""industrial metaverse"" projects and laid offstaff, as BI previously reported. That homegrown ""industrial metaverse"" had been a key AI strategy before Chat GPT took off like it did this year. And that means that if Open AI up and implodes, Microsoft no longer has a fast backup plan. On the other hand, various reports — and just plain common sense — say that Altman won't come back unless the management structure of Open AI is altered, and the four board members who fired him resign. Should that happen, Microsoft could actually wind up in a better position to influence this all-important company that seems to need badly need the guidance, probably with a board seat. ""The growing consensus from Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that the days for this four-person board are numbered and Altman will be back at Open AI and ultimately Microsoft in an even stronger position to control Open AI's strategic direction,"" Ives said.

203,Business Insider,"Health People live 10 extra years in Loma Linda, California – the US's only original Blue Zone. Take a look inside their life.",Hilary Brueck,"       Drive east from Los Angeles for about an hour and you'll arrive at the sunny, palm-tree-dotted suburban town of Loma Linda, Spanish for ""beautiful hill."" From the freeway, the city of 25,000 looks much like any other LA suburb. Strip malls, fast-food joints, gas stations, and a big, shiny hospital. But the way people live here is different. It's 9 a.m. on a Thursday when I arrive, and driving up the hillside I see the gym's parking lot is packed. Inside, it's buzzing with seniors. A group of about 25 people is standing in a circle practicing balance and stability — many are over 70 (or even 80) years old, but none bat an eye at any of the one-legged, one-armed moves that their trainer takes them through. ""Don't shoot your neighbor!"" another instructor says with a smile. She is teaching rockin' chair aerobics, which involves resistance bands. I'm impressed (and relieved I'm not participating) when they pick up their bouncy balls and start clapping to the music while throwing the balls into mid-air. Their skill is astounding, but perhaps not surprising. These people are famous for being fit. Their hometown is one of the world's five Blue Zones, where residents appear to live especially long,healthylives. For decades, people have marveled at how they do it — including in a recent Netflix documentary. Have they unlocked some precioussecret to longevity? We're about an hour away from Disneyland, and this place feels like its own kind of dream world, with the sun shining over the brand-new blue pickleball courts and a glittering swimming pool, ready for aqua aerobics. No one is shouting out commands at people to push their bodies as hard or as fast as possible at the gym. The atmosphere is easygoing, supportive, and social. Roughly 1,600 locals will gladly pass through here today, taking classes and connecting with one another. Standing in the warm sunshine, I find myself thinking:Wait. That's it?If this is the formula for staving off the declines that so often come with old age, it's stunningly simple. It's tempting to wonder whether this whole Blue Zone longevity concept is kind of, well, BS. An Australian woman, in town visiting family, puts my thought into words. Surely nothing they're doing here is that spectacular, she said. Can itreallybe true, she asked me, that these suburbanites living in one of themost pollutedregions of the country regularlyoutlive other Americansby about 10 years or so? She is among the critics who believe that the mystery of Blue Zones is probably just a result ofpoor record-keeping, or other data problems. But Loma Lindans contend that their longevity ""secrets"" are both real and plain to see — and that their daily, incremental investments in healthy aging are available to anyone who'll take a few moments to observe the lifestyle. The city of Loma Linda, first established as a health resort in the late 1800s, makes it easy for people to age well by design. And religion plays a huge role in that. One in every four people you meet in Loma Linda is a Seventh-Day Adventist Christian, according tothe church. If you include the surrounding suburbs, there are around 21,000 practicing Adventists in this region. Some even worship at a former country club that wasconverted into a church, to keep up with the demand. Their faith guides their daily diet and exercise choices. Adventists contend that God was the original plant-based diet advocate — He wanted people to eat things that dropped out of trees and sprouted from the Earth. Shunning toxins, while promoting healthy foods and community activities, is part of the fabric of life here. There's no smoking or vaping allowed much anywhere (even outdoors) and there are no liquor stores or bars either. Adventists do not eat fast food; it wasn'tuntil 2013that Mc Donald's showed up, after years of fierce opposition from the residents. Instead, they follow a kind of Garden of Eden strategy that is rooted in their faith, with fresh vegetables, beans, fruit, and nuts at the core of their diet. When Adventists come together for a meal, there are colorful haystacks to eat, which are essentially deconstructed taco salads, beds of corn chips layered with beans and fresh vegetables on top. Some of the rules and rituals Adventists adhere to are intense. (Strict Adventists don't even eat mustard or pepper, shunning any sort of potential stimulant. Traditionally, caffeine is also a no-no.) But most Adventists I met in Loma Linda were a bit more flexible with their religious edicts, while still recognizing that the key principles of their faith can help them live more humbly, and more healthfully too. Retired nurse Mary Reynolds, a vegan Adventist, says the fresh produce section of the grocery store is unequivocally ""the best part."" Reynolds, who is 73, still mentors patients with heart disease, high cholesterol, and other chronic health issues, taking them on tours of the Loma Linda market, and teaching them her shopping tricks, including learning how to check food labels for red flags. ""The fruits and veggies are the ones that don't have labels, and they are loaded with a lot ofnutritional value and vitaminsthat are beneficial for health,"" she said. Instead of meat, there is a plethora of meat-free alternatives – a pride of the Adventists, whofounded veggie patty juggernaut Morningstar Farms. I dropped by the market for lunch, winding through aisles of whole grains, beans, nuts, and produce, until I arrived at a hot bar serving jalapeño tofu and Thanksgiving ""turkey"" with a side of sweet potatoes, carrots, and Brussels sprouts — plenty ofhigh-volume, fiber-filled foodsto keep me full for hours on end. Chef ""grumpy"" gauging my skepticism at the fake bird he'd prepared, told me his vegetarian take on the traditional holiday staple would ""kick Tofurkey's butt."" I took a bite. The fake turkey ""meat"" was, indeed, bursting with flavor, with a good dose of rosemary and other spices in the mix. This is the part of life you hear about most when people talk about Loma Linda's longevity: The unprocessed vegetarian diet. It takesso much effortto eat this way elsewhere — you have to find the few scarce menu items without meat, pay extra for the ""healthy"" snacks like fruit and nuts instead of chips or soda, or diligently meal prep before you venture out into the wilds of our fast food nation. Institutional support makes it possible for busy Loma Lindans to accomplish their faith-based longevity diet strategy day after day without giving it much thought at all. ""They've made it something which is practical,"" Gary Fraser, a local cardiologist, told me. Fraser has been studying exactlyhow and why his fellow Adventists fare so well, by conducting National Institutes of Health-funded studies. Fraser said the Adventist diet is crucial for reducing rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and cognitive decline in the community. Inone oft-cited 2001 study that Fraser conducted, vegetarian Adventist men lived 10 extra years beyond other Californians. For women, the same advantage was an additional six years. But diet can't be everything. Millions of people around the world are vegetarians and theydon't all outlive meat-eaterslike this. Alongside the healthy cuisine comes regular exercise, plus a day of rest, song, potlucks, and prayer each Saturday, or ""Sabbath."" ""We come before you to slow down,"" Pastor Filip Milosavljevic at the Loma Linda University Church said, addressing Jesus in a recent Saturday morning sermon. Looking out at the full crowd in the dark hall, packed with babies, teens, parents and grandparents, Milosavljevic encouraged his 6,000-strong congregation, gathered both in-person and online, to think about how our daily habits end up shaping who we become, and color the way we interact with the people around us. He, too, struggles to put down his phone while in line at the grocery store, or avoid grabbing it first thing in the morning when he wakes up, he admitted to the congregation. When friends are heading out for fast food, he doesn't always want to go home and eat beans again. ""Jesus, speak into our lives this morning a word we desperately need to hear, soften our pride as we listen."" Listen, they did. Loma Lindans believe in the power of their weekly reset; a day of rest every Saturday to pause and reflect. You won't find much of anything in Loma Linda open on Saturdays when Adventists worship. Some businesses start winding down on Friday, with reduced hours in the afternoon. It's a sharp contrast to the American hustle-and-grind culture, which is ripe for burnout. ""You look forward to getting up in the mornings,"" Lorie Purdey, a retired Adventist pastor told me — even if ""not everything's perfect."" I got that sense in every conversation I had as I walked around Loma Linda. There was Esther van den Hoven, an incredibly sharp 99-year-old living in a retirement home, who could describe details of her long and varied life in impressive detail — from birth in Germany to adulthood in Australia and the US. She isn't quite sure how she's managed to live this long, really. Her parents didn't live to extraordinarily old ages, so it's unlikely she has anyunique genetic advantage, but she still seems to have very good mental and physical health as she nears 100. ""I've had a very good life. I mean, not financially wonderful, but very blessed and I'm happy,"" she said. ""Of course, sometimes I think of my last days and then I'm not so happy. But I trust God for his leading. He has led me all these years, and he won't let me get lost now."" That's what motivates her to stay active. She crochets every day, goes on 20-minute walks around the neighborhood, and spends time with the other three generations of her family, including five grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. There was also Dr. David Baylink, who, at 92 years old, still wakes up every weekday morning, mounts his ""crotch rocket"" style Kawasaki, and rides for 10 minutes over to the university hospital, where he conducts clinical research. Afterwards, he plays tennis. ""People are asking me all the time why I'm not retired,"" Baylink said. ""Not everybody needs a purpose, but a lot of people need a purpose — and I'm one of them."" Increasingly, research is showing that such asense of purposecan help you live longer. Like many Adventists, Baylink also makes time in his schedule for rest and hiking, enjoying the beauty of nature each weekend. He doesn't drink any caffeine — water, vegetables, and a little fish are what keep him going, he says. Baylink believes in a concept calledhormesis, the idea that a little bit of stress can be good for the aging body, but too much stress is toxic. ""If you exercise moderately, why, you get stronger and more resilient. If you exercise too much, you actually worsen your condition,"" he explains. Of course, it's easy tocarpe diemwhen the sun is shining every day. Here, conditions are always ripe for America's new favorite social pastime: pickleball. Thanks to some campaigning from local legend Bob ""Mr. Pickleball"" Mitchell, a local senior center's two faded tennis courts were swapped out for eight new, bright blue pickleball courts — which are now packed with players day and night. It's an accessible sport that is lighter on the body than tennis, making it perfect for the Adventist dedication to staying fit and being social. A large, long-term Danish studythat was published in 2018 showed that team sports like pickleball, tennis, and soccer were linked to longer lifespans than solo endeavors like running and swimming — an extra boost that could, perhaps, be driven by the communal aspect of the games. ""What other sport can you find an 89-year-old sharing the court with someone decades younger than them?"" Mitchell, 71, asked. On the courts, I meet a diverse group of people – many of whom are health professionals themselves, working at the local hospital the Adventists founded in the early 1900s. Mailen Kootsey, an 84-year-old retired physicist and human physiology expert, is one of the regulars on Mitchell's new courts. He told me he picked up pickleball about six years ago. ""I figured it was really better for me than tennis as I got a little older,"" Kootsey said. ""As long as I can walk — even though I can't run very well — I go out and play. And if I can't hit the ball, I just say 'good shot,' and we move on."" For Kootsey, pickleball has been a nice way to stay connected with different people in his community. Alongside his wife of 62 years, Lynne, he also volunteers for about three hours a week at a local soup kitchen which feeds hot breakfast to unhoused people. Everything Kootsey is saying to me is textbook longevity stuff.Thisis what bowled over Dan Buettner in 2004, and still propels his Blue Zones empire. Buettner is constantly extolling the power of this multifaceted lifestyle — eating well, exercising, having purpose, being social, building strong relationships, and contributing to your community. It's almost like Kootsey was drawn from some kind of Blue Zone how-to manual. The specific, powerful, daily rituals and beliefs of this octogenarian are what simple record-keeping can't capture. It clearly works for him, and it could probably work for me too, if I could figure out how to implement it. Driving back down the ""beautiful"" hill and out of town, I find myself smiling, glancing over at my bag of roasted almonds and container of date-rich energy hunks from the Loma Linda Market. I think back to my conversation at the gym, with the Australian woman who questioned what's reallythatdifferent about this place. I came here a skeptic, prepared to find something to criticize, even just a little bit. But it's been two days, walking around, meeting people, and re-reading the scientific studies, and the only thing I've encountered is some serious confirmation. It's almost laughable how perfectly everyone fits the mold. Eat right, exercise, have faith, and seek your purpose. That's it?Yes, that actuallyisit, I think as I roll back into gridlock traffic on the California freeway. My knuckles tightly gripped around the steering wheel once again, my ankle straining from slamming on the brakes. I'm on my way back to LA, using the commute to mentally plan where I might quickly get a bite to eat before another work event. If you don't live in a place that's set up like Loma Linda, it's deceptively hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle for even one day, let alone long-term. A lifestyle that can quietly, subtly, over time add up to several extra years of life enjoyment should be a community effort, not a solitary grind. Can we follow this model elsewhere? I'm not so sure. Fraser doesn't believe a Loma Lindan life extension program would be unattainable, or even particularly expensive, for the whole nation. Indeed, a new American Heart Association study suggests that people who abide by Loma Linda-style tenets about food, exercise, and stress canlive an extra six years. But it would take some time to implement. If we wanted to confer these health benefits to all Americans, we'dneed more neighborhoodsthat make walking, biking, hiking and connecting easier. We'd need healthy produce, grains, and nuts that aren't out of reach, instead ofusing processed foodsas a default for busy schedules. We'd all have to embrace eating less meat, and enjoying plenty of savory, tasty, satiating meat-free dishes packed with nutrients and protein. In short, we'd need simple systems that encourage eating, moving, and living for healthy aging, purpose, and connection; instead of having our schedules so packed we can't find time to move, people so stressed that chronic diseases come easier and earlier, and fast food that kills. It would take decades to set up the kinds of systems that would allow all of us to live like Ethlyn Obland, a 73-year-old retired nurse manager who I met as I toured around this city at the foot of the San Bernardino mountains. Obland, known by everyone here as ""Obi,"" likes taking multi-mile walks up into the foothills with her dogs about three days a week. On the days she's not hiking, she's out enjoying regular pickleball matches with friends. And she shares a potluck dinner with a group of like-minded single women every Sabbath, featuring vegetarian fare including mushroom-walnut patties made with cottage cheese, and ginger carrots. ""​​We're certainly not perfect examples of health, but we know the right principles,"" Obi told me. ""Your body is your temple where you want the spirit of God to live and dwell within — You can't ask the spirit to come into your life if you're not living right.""

204,Business Insider,Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd's daily routine starts at 5:15 a.m.,Kylie Kirschner,"       Whitney Wolfe Herd recently announced that she was stepping down as the CEO of the dating app Bumble after nearly 10 years and moving into the role of executive chair. Wolfe Herd, who launched thewomen-focused dating appin 2014, became theyoungest female CEO ever to take a company publicwhen Bumble had its IPO in 2021. Here's a look at Wolfe Herd's daily routine, according to past interviews. Wolfe Herd usually wakes up at 5:15 a.m. and starts responding to emails, she told The Times of Londonin 2017. Her days were often unpredictable and started at different times during that time period, so she did her best to maintain a stablemorning routine, she told Entrepreneur. ""I sleep with the drapes open to rise with the sun,"" Wolfe Herdtold the outletback in 2017. ""I think that's a healthy thing to do because even if you don't like to wake up early, your body does adjust."" She added that she keeps a bottle of water and a yoga mat next to her bed tohydrate first thingand that she gets in a morning workout before going on her phone. ""I spend the first 30 minutes of the morning being cognizant of my family and dog — taking him for a walk, spending time with my fiancé — before it goes into madness and work mode,"" Wolfe Herd said. Wolfe Herd married her husband, the oil and gas heir Michael Herd, in 2017. The couple has since had two sons together, the first in 2019 and the second in 2022. In aninterviewwith Time earlier this year, Wolfe Herd said she tries to make sure she has no calls scheduled while she drives her older son to preschool, so she can give him her full attention. ""And then the minute I drop him off, literally as I'm giving him a hug out the door, I have to dial into something,"" she told the publication. ""But I've structured it so that that call on the way home is totally sequenced perfectly to get back to my computer to then pick up another two things on Zoom."" The Tinder cofounder gave The New York Times a day-by-day breakdown of herscheduleover one week in 2019. That week, it includedtestifying at the Texas Capitolbuilding in support of a bill to criminalize sending unsolicited lewd photos; looking over the rebranding of Chappy, the brand's since-shuttered gay dating app; discussing whether or not to add videos to Bumble dating profiles; a quarterly strategy meeting; a monthly directors' meeting; and a call with Emma Watson. Wolfe Herd also told the Times that she liked to go through her inbox and answer emails on Saturdays, as she had more time to respond thoughtfully,storing email draftsand hitting send on Monday mornings so she didn't make her staff anxious with weekend emails. In the days leading up to her older son's birth, Wolfe Herd said she was still signing business deals, she told Time, and she checked her email from the hospital. With her second child, she said she tried to go offline for the first 10 days — but she did bring him to an earnings announcement with her when he was five weeks old. Wolfe Herd enjoys cooking as a way to unwind and connect with her family. ""You only have two hands,"" Wolfe Herd told Entrepreneur in 2017. ""If you are chopping veggies, you are forcing yourself to put the phone down or step away from the computer. It's extremely relaxing. As stressful as cooking might be, it's a stress that is different from the stress of the day. It creates a really nice shift of thought process."" Wolfe Herd could be described as somewhat of aworkaholic, however — she's been known to wake up every two hours through the night to check her emails, although she told the Times in 2017 that she was trying to break the habit. Like many parents, Wolfe Herd also said she dealt withlate nights and sleep deprivation. ""You just never know what you're gonna get,"" Wolfe Herd told Time. ""It's tricky because you need so much of your brain during the day to be a CEO. You need a rational, rested mind to function. Everyone says: 'One day at a time.' I actually prefer one hour at a time.""   Read next",2023-11-19T14:59:13Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
205,Business Insider,Argentina's Trump-like presidential candidate wins election,Associated Press,"       Argentina's Economy Minister Sergio Massa conceded defeat to populist Javier Milei in Sunday's fiercely polarized presidential runoff even before the country's electoral authority released official results. Massa congratulated his opponent, a right-wing economist who has promised a dramatic shake-up for many of the nation's institutions and welcomed frequent comparisons of him to former U.S. President Donald Trump. Immediately after Massa's concession speech, the Argentine electoral authority released partial results: With 86.6% of votes tallied, Milei had 55.95% and Massa 44.04%. With a Milei victory, the country will swing to the right amid discontent over soaring inflation and rising poverty, and empower a freshman lawmaker who describes himself as an anarcho-capitalist and got his start as a television talking head blasting what he called the ""political caste."" Inflation has soared above 140% and poverty has worsened while Massa has held his post. Milei,a self-described anarcho-capitalist, has proposed to slash the size of the state and rein in inflation, while the government minister he was running against warned people about the negative impacts of such policies. The election forced many to decide which of the two they considered to be the least bad choice. Milei's screeds resonated widely with Argentines angered by their struggle to make ends meet, particularly young men. ""Money covers less and less each day. I'm a qualified individual, and my salary isn't enough for anything,"" Esteban Medina, a 26-year-old physical therapist from Ezeiza, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a Milei rally earlier this week. Massa, as one of the most prominent figures in a deeply unpopular administration, was once seen as having little chance of victory. But he managed to mobilizethe networks of his Peronist partyand clinched a decisive first-place finish in the first round of voting. His campaign cautioned Argentines that his libertarian opponent's plan to eliminate key ministries and otherwise sharply curtail the state would threaten public services, including health and education, and welfare programs many rely on. Massa also drew attention to his opponent's often aggressive rhetoric and openly questioned his mental acuity; ahead of the first round, Milei sometimes carried arevving chainsaw at rallies. Speaking after casting her vote at the stately University of Buenos Aires Law School, Jenifer Pio, 36, told the AP that she fears a Milei victory would risk the return of dictatorship. ""Milei doesn't have the faintest idea of how to govern,"" said Pio, a homemaker. ""It isn't bad that he's prideful, but he would need to have a bit more stability. He's unstable emotionally and psychologically. He's unwell."" Ana Iparraguirre, a partner at pollster GBAO Strategies, said Massa's ""only chance to win this election when people want change ... is to make this election a referendum on whether Milei is fit to be president or not."" ""We're starting a new chapter in Argentina, and this chapter requires not only goodwill, intelligence and capability but above all, dialogue and the necessary consensus for our homeland to traverse a much more virtuous path in the future,"" Massa told journalists Sunday after casting his ballot. Milei accused Massa and his allies of running a ""campaign of fear"" and he walked back some of his most controversial proposals, such as loosening gun control. In his final campaign ad, Milei looks at the camera and assures voters he has no plans to privatize education or health care. ""We did a great job despite the fear campaign and all the dirty tactics they used against us,"" Milei told journalists after he voted amid a large security operation as dozens of supporters and journalists gathered at his polling place. One of his supporters is María Gabriela Gaviola, a 63-year-old entrepreneur doing everything she can to avoid shuttering her company, which manufactures veterinary products, amid surging prices for materials. And the government hasn't helped, including Massa who has held his ministerial post for over a year. ""The productive sector of this country isn't considered. How long can a country that doesn't produce be OK?"" said Gaviola, who has taken on two side jobs to keep her company afloat. ""Truth is, I don't know Milei. I've heard him a bit. I don't know him, but the one who I already know doesn't help me. I prefer to try something new."" Most pre-election polls, which have been notoriously wrong at every step of this year's campaign, showed a statistical tie between the two candidates. Voters for first-round candidates who didn't make the runoff will be key. Patricia Bullrich, who placed third, hasendorsed Milei. Underscoring the bitter division this campaign has brought to the fore, Mileireceived both jeers and cheerson Friday night at the legendary Colón Theater in Buenos Aires. Those divisions were also evident Sunday when Milei's running mate, Victoria Villaruel, went to vote and was met by protesters angry at her claims that the number of victims from Argentina's bloody 1976-1983 military dictatorship is farbelow what human rights organizations have long claimed, amongother controversial positions. The vote took place amid Milei'sallegations of possible electoral fraud, reminiscent of those from Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Without providing evidence, Milei claimed that the first round of the presidential election was plagued by irregularities that affected the result. Experts say such irregularities cannot swing an election, and that his assertions were partly aimed at firing up his base and motivating his supporters to become monitors of voting stations. Such claims spread widely on social media and, at Milei's rally in Ezeiza earlier this week, all those interviewed told the AP they were concerned about the integrity of the vote.

206,Business Insider,Seoul's workers ditched remote work. Now it has the strongest office market.,Polly Thompson,"       The debate over whether companies should allow flexible work-from-home arrangements versus mandating their employees to return to the office continues todivide the US workforce. But the booming South Korean office market may bolster arguments that it is better for employees to head back to the office — at least for those watching the US'sstruggling commercial-real-estatesector. In Seoul, over 98% of grade-A offices are occupied thanks to white-collar workers returning to the office. The increase in competition for office space has led to a roughly 15% rise in rental prices over the last year,Bloombergreported. Claire Choi, the head of research for Korea at Global Commercial Real Estate Services, or CBRE, told Bloomberg that the trend was ""a cultural thing."" ""If we are told to come back to the office, we will come back to the office,"" Choi said. In summer 2021, 91.5% of the country's leading firms were implementing WFH policies, a survey by Korea Enterprises Federation, or KEF, found,Pulse Newsreported. As COVID-19 restrictions have eased, the number of jobs allowing employees to work from home has declined. KEF found that now, fewer than 60% of big companies allow their employees to work remotely. Of the 40% of companies KEF surveyed that still allow remote work, almost two-thirds of those companies said they only allow it selectively. ""The main form of telework nowadays is selecting those who need to work from home or allowing it on a limited basis by receiving applications as needed,"" an official from KEF told Pulse News. But it's not only demand and working culture that boosts the Korean market's strength. There has been a general shortage of office space since 2021 due to government restrictions on redevelopment and the pandemic's disruption of construction. The Korean economy has also seen steady growth, bolstering both international and domestic investment. But US business districtshave struggledbecause of the rise in popularity of working from home and many employees' reluctance to start commuting five days a week again. Goldman Sachs found that the share of US workers who work from home at least some of the workweekhas stabilizedthis year to around 20% to 25%, below a pandemic peak of 47% but above the pre-pandemic average of 2.6%. Almost 30% of employees also now use a hybrid work model,Forbesreported. Commercial landlords have seen tenants cut space or move out completely amid the new remote-work culture and office vacancies were at a 30-year high of 18.2% in the US in the second quarter, according to CBREresearch. The Biden administrationrecently announcedplans to incentivize developers to convert empty offices into apartments to help alleviate the US housing crisis.

207,Business Insider,"31 premature babies suffering from dehydration, hypothermia, and sepsis were safely taken out of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City",Associated Press,"       Health officials said 31 premature babies in ""extremely critical condition"" were transferred safely Sunday from Gaza's main hospital and will go to Egypt, while over 250 patients with severely infected wounds and other urgent conditions remained stranded days after Israeli forces entered the compound to look for Hamas operations there. The plight of the babies, along with Israeli claims against Shifa Hospital, have become potent symbols in the devastating war between Israel and Hamas. An Israeli offensive has taken a heavy toll on Palestinian civilians, while Israel has accused Hamas of using Shifa and other hospitals as headquarters for military operations. The newborns from the hospital, where power was cut and supplies ran out while Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants outside, were receiving urgent care in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. They had dehydration, hypothermia, and sepsis in some cases, said Mohamed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals. Four other babies died in the two days before the evacuation, he said. A World Health Organization team that visited Shifa for an hour Saturday said hospital corridors were filled with medical and solid waste, increasing the risk of infection for patients who were ""terrified for their safety and health, and pleaded forevacuation."" Twenty-five staff stayed behind. The U.N. agency said the vast majority of patients had amputations, burns, or other trauma, and many wounds were severely infected, with antibiotics unavailable. Missions were being planned to evacuate the remaining people to southern Gaza in the next 24-72 hours, ""pending guarantees of safe passage,"" the WHO said. Later Sunday, Israel's army said it had strong evidence supporting its claims that Hamas maintains a sprawlingcommand post inside and under Shifa. Israel has portrayed the hospital as a key target in its war to end Hamas' rule in Gaza following the militant group'swide-ranging attack into southern Israelsix weeks ago. The army said it found a 55-meter (60-yard) tunnel about 10 meters under the hospital's 20-acre complex, which includes several buildings, garages and a plaza. It said the tunnel included a staircase, blast-proof door, and a firing hole that could be used by snipers. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify Israel's findings, which included security camera video showing what the military said were two foreign hostages, one Thai and one Nepalese, taken to the hospital following the Oct. 7 attack. The army also said an independent medical report had determined that a female Israeli soldier, Cpl. Noa Marciano, whose body was recovered in Gaza last week, had been killed by Hamas in the hospital. Marciano had earlier been injured in an Israeli strike Nov. 9 that killed her captor, according to Israel's intelligence assessment. The injuries were not life-threatening but she was then killed by a Hamas militant in Shifa, the army said, Hamas and hospital staff earlier denied the allegations of a command post under Shifa. Critics describe the hospital as a symbol of what they call Israel's reckless endangerment of civilians. Thousands in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes, and there are severe shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel in the besieged territory. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan dismissed the Israeli military's announcement and didn't deny that Gaza hashundreds of kilometers of tunnels. However, he said, ""the Israelis said there was a command and control center, which means that the matter is greater than just a tunnel."" Read next",2023-11-19T23:36:04Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
208,Business Insider,Baby boomers got rich off real estate. They're in a perfect position to do it again,Cork Gaines,"       With their $82 trillion nest egg,baby boomershave helped the US economy with their spending. They're also in the perfect position tohelp themselves by takingadvantage of the current real estate market. According to a new report this week from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), older Americans are making up a larger portion of home buyers and are in a better position to purchase a home in the current market. And with moresellers cutting pricesand signs that prices could start falling, buying real estate now puts them in a perfect place to build even more wealth the next time prices rise,especially since equity- and cash-rich boomers are less susceptible to sky-high mortgage rates than younger buyers. According to the report, repeat buyers — people who have previously purchased a home — now make up 68% of all purchases. Since 1981, the average for this group was 62%. In addition, the average age for a repeat buyer this year was 58, down one year from last year's all-time high of 59. That is right on the cusp of boomers aged between 59 and 77. According to the NAR, older Americans are better positioned to buy houses. ""We are still talking about an incredibly difficult market for first-time buyers to enter, even if there's slightly less competition,"" NAR deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz wrote. ""If there's a multi-offer situation, an all-cash buyer or someone who has a lot of equity is likely to win. And that person is going to be older."" That's where boomers have the advantage. Nearly 18% of the US population is 65 or older, the highest level since the Census Bureaubegan tracking the rate in 1920. However, boomers have about half of the combined net worth in the US at approximately $82 trillion,according to the Federal Reserve. About 24% of that wealth ($19 trillion) is in real estate — more than the $16 trillion they have in pensions and just behind the $21 trillion they have in stocks. Whilemortgage rateshave fallen a bit in recent weeks, they are still north of 7%, pricing many young Americans out of thehousing market.Homeownershipis now deemed unaffordable in nearly 80% of all US counties. However, boomers can make stronger bids on homes for sale because of their savings and real estate equity. They can make larger down payments or even all-cash purchases as they are more likely toown a homealready, and 68% of adults 70 years and older aremortgage-free. According to the NAR, the average down payment for a repeat buyer was 19%, compared to just 8% for first-timers. Meanwhile, more than one-third ofhouse purchases in September were all-cash, according to the real estate broker Red Fin. Thehousing markethas been in an ugly place for buyers, but there are signs that they are beginning to see better deals, withhome constructionon the rise and more sellers dropping their asking prices. A growing inventory mixed with active price cuts is good news for people buying houses, and several experts arepredicting big cost drops, including Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO. ""House prices will come down,"" Grantham said on""The Compound and Friends"" podcast.""30% would be a pretty good guess."" David Rosenberg, Rosenberg Research president and former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, told Insider in February thathouse prices could fallby as much as 25% from their peak in 2022. Even if prices don't fall dramatically, they are at leastholding steady. If we assume that demand and prices will rise again in the second half of 2024, when the Federal Reserve may begintolower interest rates, now is the time to buy a house if interest rates are not a concern. And for many boomers, they are not. Read next",2023-11-19T10:32:01Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
209,Business Insider,College Board rakes in cash with AP exams. But do students benefit?,John L. Dorman,"       For high school students across the United States, Advanced Placement courses offer a curriculum that not only exposes them to university-level work but can give them credits for college should they score high enough on end-of-course exams. For many students from low-income and working-class backgrounds, the benefits of AP coursework can be the difference between saving tuition money from earned credits or forgoing college due to a lack of funding. For the College Board, which created and administers the AP program, increasing access to AP coursework has been a significant part of the organization's work over the past 20 years. And part of that push by the AP has been to increase the number of low-income students taking courses and exams, which requires a significant educational and financial investment. However, as the College Board has pitched more schools to sign on to AP coursework and register students for exams, the performance levels for low-income test-takers has not dramatically shifted from the early 2000s: 60 percent of students from this demographic group only earned a 1 or 2 out of a possible 5 on the exam, which precludes them from earning college credit for the AP course. In 2023, 38 percent of all test-takers scored a 1 or 2, with low-income students posting higher failure rates. Yet taxpayers this year shelled out at least $90 million to pay for AP exams that a sizable percentage of students didn't pass,according to The New York Times. The Times, based on its own analysis of College Board files and local education budgets, said that the organization receives about $100 million each year in public money for AP exams. In response to The Times, the College Board said that in 2023, it had received at least $90 million from the federal government to cover exam fees. In tax filings, the College Board stated that it took in roughly $5 million to $6 million in direct government funding each year, according to the newspaper. At $98 per exam for US test-takers, AP fees bring in a lot of money to the organization, and the push to enroll more low-income students into the program comes at a time where revenue from the SAT — the College Board test that in recent years has become optional for students applying to a swath of institutions — has sharply declined. The Times reported that from 2019 to 2022, SAT revenue dropped from $403.6 million to $289.2 million, a reflection of the test being less ubiquitous in the college admissions process. The College Board stands firmly behind its AP push, though, pointing to equity and the need to expand education opportunities for students who may not have been initially on a college coursework track. ""What if the best stuff in education were not just for the best to distinguish themselves — but could engage a much broader set of kids?"" College Board chief executive David Coleman saidduring a podcastearlier this year. ""Why are we holding it for some?"" The College Board, reflecting on its own analysis, stated that AP coursework boosts students across the board, independent of their respective scores on the exam. The organization has made this argument as AP has morphed into its financial crown jewel. The program in 2022 brought in nearly $500 million in revenue. While the AP expansion has offered more opportunities to a broad range of students, questions remain regarding the actual preparedness of low-income students, as they often lack the funding to pay for expensive test preparation courses and may not have been exposed to as much high-level work as their upper-income peers before high school. In 2023, a record 1.1 million students from low-income households took AP exams, per The Times. It's a sharp increase from 2003 when 153,000 low-income students took the exams. Overall, 5.2 million students sat down for AP exams in 2023, a more than threefold increase from 2002, when 1.6 million students took the exams. Trevor Packer, who heads the Advanced Placement program, told The Times that the number of students taking on the intense AP curriculum and the push to find students who can perform well in the classes more than makes up for the low scores from many test-takers. In a statement, the College Board said that the money it receives from the government — about 18 percent of its overall revenue — was ""minimal"" compared to its operating revenue. ""We believe these are worthwhile investments in preparing all students for their futures,"" the organization said. ""We recognize that all students are not yet receiving equitable preparation for AP coursework and that such work requires addressing inequities that occur years prior.""

210,Business Insider,"I stayed at the Equinox Hotel, New York City's premiere spot for fitness-obsessed travelers. Take a look inside my swanky, wellness-focused room.",Jordan Parker Erb,"Since moving to New York City, I've looked at Equinox with a sense of longing. The chain of fitness clubs is one of the nicest in the city, wherememberships cost hundreds of dollars— a stark comparison to the $20 I pay for a gym in Brooklyn. With high-end amenities and locations around the city, Equinox is a place for highly ambitious, fitness-focused people to see and be seen. The same goes for its hotel. The Equinox Hotel, opened in 2019, has been dubbed the ""fittest hotel on Earth,"" and was chosen this year as one of thebest hotels in the world. Earlier this month, I got to check it out for myself. I stayed in one of the hotel's ""Deluxe City View Guest Rooms,"" which starts at around $995 per night. Business Insider paid a press rate of $495 for this stay. Take a look inside my swanky, wellness-focused room. According to its website,Equinox was founded in 1991and has over 100 clubs worldwide. The hotel, however, is the first of its kind. Located in Hudson Yards, one of Manhattan's newest neighborhoods, the luxury hotel is steps away fromthe Vessel, a flashy art installation. It's also near the High Line, a public park built along an elevated railroad track. Having never been to Hudson Yards, I was surprised by how much I liked the area. Equinox Hotel is located inside35 Hudson Yards, a 92-story residential buildingwith retail stores at its base. On the ground level, there's a Soul Cycle, Starbucks, and, of course, the entrance to the hotel. I was admittedly a bit confused when I stepped into the hotel's first floor, which was virtually empty, with just a long entryway leading to an elevator. But a doorman directed me to the 25th floor, where I could check in. The sky-high lobby, with a swanky seating area and city views, gives guests an idea of what their room will be like. When I opened the door to my room, the lights softly turned on, and the automated window shades opened. Stepping inside, I found a modern, high-end living area with more space than expected from a New York City hotel room. I couldn't have asked for a better view. Because of Manhattan's density, some hotels' and apartments' windows look straight into another building. I could see much of the city from my room, including 30 Hudson Yards. Finished in 2019,the skyscraper is home to The Edge, a popular observation deck and tourist destination. The room came stocked with dozens of health and self-care items, like face masks and serums, many of which I didn't even know how to use. These goodies weren't free; if you opened or removed them, they would be charged to your room. I didn't end up using any wellness items, but I loved that the option was there. Again, these items weren't complimentary, but I loved having the option to use them. Some things did come complimentary with the room, including a drawer full of fitness equipment. Guests can use the room's yoga mat, blocks, foam roller, and ball to massage sore muscles. I thought it was a nice touch and was excited to use the foam roller before bed. This isn't your average mini bar. The little bar in my room came with cocktails from Via Carota, an Italian restaurantin Manhattan's West Village, often buzzing with A-list stars like Taylor Swift. For the morning, there were four different espresso pods to choose from, as well as a handful of different teas. The only thing I was surprised by was that there weren't any protein bars or shakes in the room — I imagined that in such a fitness-centered hotel, there would be a plethora of high-protein snacks and drinks to choose from. Still, the snacks that were offered were at least on the healthy side, and there was a good variety, which I appreciated. Like most hotel-room food, eating it would cost you. I love cozying up in a robe, so this was a nice touch. The ""Scandinavian Sleep Method,"" as Business Insider previously reported, involves using two comforters or duvets instead of one. I thought it was a clever idea, as it allows you to share a bed without battling for the comforter. And because I was traveling solo, I got to use both — making my sleep feel extra luxurious. Using the tablet located conveniently on the bedside table, I could control all my room's settings. One of the most interesting actions the tablet can control is called ""Dark. Quiet. Cool,"" which dims the lights and drops the room's temperature. The button brings the room to ""the optimal sleep environment,"" per Equinox Hotel's website. Want to shower with a view of the Manhattan skyline? You can keep the shower glass clear, giving you an unrestricted view of your room and the city beyond it. However, if you're looking for more privacy, you can flip a switch, fogging the glass and obscuring the city view. I'd never seen anything like this before, and loved the idea of showering while looking out at the city — but I also appreciated the option for more privacy. I love fitness and taking care of my health, but sometimes get so caught up in life that it takes a back seat. Staying at the Equinox Hotel gave me an idea of what my life would be like if my wellness was at the forefront, 24/7 — and I absolutely loved it. Its smart attention to details (optimized sleep, healthy snacks, and in-room fitness equipment) made me feel healthier, even if just for a day. Read next",2023-11-19T17:41:16Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0

212,Business Insider,Photos show how Princess Diana's funeral was portrayed on 'The Crown' compared to real life,Eve Crosbie,"The tragic and suddendeath of Princess Dianaand the public's response to itchanged everything for the royal family. So it's no surprise that ""The Crown"" season six spends its first three episodes depicting the events that led up to the car crash that claimed her life at the age of 36 in 1997. The fourth episode focuses on the aftermath, including how the unprecedented outpouring of public grief persuaded the Queen to go against protocol in more ways than one. Unsurprisingly, the televised memorial that took place a week after her passing on September 6, 1997, was watched by 2.5 billion people worldwide,according to History.com. Here's how ""The Crown"" depicts Diana's funeral and the surrounding events — and what they looked like in real life. As depicted in episode four of season six, the Queen saw no reason to follow protocol for a royal death abroad in Diana's case because she was no longer officially HRH when she died, having given up her title upon her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996. The Queen also faced criticism from the public and the press for not traveling down from Balmoral in Scotland to Buckingham Palace in London immediately after the tragedy. Although they were scheduled to arrive in London the day before the funeral procession, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh moved their travel date by a day, allowing them to speak to mourners paying their respects, according to The New York Times. The Queen (Imelda Staunton) is shown delivering a speech after returning to Buckingham Palace. The Queen's decision to address the nation was unexpected at the time. Christmas Day broadcasts aside, according to The New York Times,she had only given one personal address to the country before. In 1991, she called for prayers for soldiers in the Gulf War. Placed on top of the coffin is a letter addressed to ""Mummy,"" which viewers see Prince Harry (Fflyn Edwards) writing earlier in the episode. Westminster Abbey has held many royal funerals and memorials in recent memory, including that of the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Prince Philip, and, most recently, Queen Elizabeth II, whodied in 2022 at the age of 96after a record-breaking 70-year reign. ""The Crown"" recreates one of the most enduring images from Diana's funeral. In the 2017 BBC documentary ""Diana, 7 Days,"" William discussed the matter, explaining that it was not an ""easy decision"" but one the family made together. ""We were overwhelmed by how many people turned out, it was just incredible. There was that balance between duty and family and that's what we had to do,"" he said. Harry added: ""I think it was a group decision. But before I knew it, I found myself with a suit on with a black tie and a white shirt, I think, and I was part of it. Genuinely, I don't have an opinion on whether that was right or wrong. I am glad I was part of it. Looking back on it now, I am very glad I was part of it."" Dodi,who died alongside Diana in the car crash, was laid to rest in a private Islamic ceremony. According to a BBC report,his body was taken to Regent's Park Mosque before being buried at a Muslim cemetery in Woking. Initially, the windows were decorated with two black-and-white photos of the pair, mounted on easels, before being replaced with a set of gold-framed color photographs. A more permanent tribute to Dodi and Diana wasrevealed in April 1998.A shrine to the couple featuring a wine glass purportedly from their final dinner and the engagement ring Dodi reportedly purchased the day before their tragic accident was set up near the department store's ground floor escalators. A lifesize statue of the pair, titled ""Innocent Victims,"" was then unveiled in 2005.

213,Business Insider,A radio station in Philadelphia has banned Taylor Swift's music ahead of the Chiefs-Eagles game,Eve Crosbie,"       A radio station in Philadelphia has banned Taylor Swift'smusic from its airwaves this weekend ahead of Monday's Philadelphia Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs NFL game. Q102, a local radio station, said that it will be doing its part to support the home team by temporarily shunning Swift's chart-topping hits in the run-up to the game, presumably because of Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce,a tight end for the Chiefs. ""Q102 is punting Taylor Swift from the radio station for the entire weekend because while Q102 loves Taylor Swift, we can't get enough of her, this weekend it's really important we show our support for the Birds,"" Nugget, a host at Q102, told CBS News Philadelphia. According to the outlet, the station will start playing Swift's music again on Tuesday. There was previously speculation that Swift would be attending the game, which will be at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. She has proven to be something of a good-luck charm for Kelce and the Chiefs: The team has wonevery game that Swift has attended so far, and the NFL has playfully pointed out Kelce'simproved on-field performancewhen she's there. But Swift will be onstage in Rio de Janeiro for arescheduled Eras Tour concert dateon Monday evening. The ""Anti-Hero"" singer was scheduled to perform the show on Saturday evening but postponed it amid extreme temperatures andfollowing the death of a fan the night before. Swift will miss out on the chance to possibly introduce her parents to Kelce's parents, Donna and Ed Kelce, because Andrea and Scott Swift — who are longtime Eagles fans — are said to be attending the game,Entertainment Tonight reported. Kelce will be playing against his older brother, Jason Kelce, for the first time since his team beat the Eaglesat the 2023 Super Bowl. Despite showing her support for the Chiefs in recent months, Swift, who grew up in Pennsylvania, previously described herself as something of an Eagles fan. After the release of her 2020 album ""Evermore,"" which featured a reference to an ""Eagles T-shirt"" on the song ""Gold Rush,"" fans began to speculate whether she meant the band of the same name or the football team. She put the debate to bed when her Eras Tour made a stop in Philadelphia in May,telling the crowd: ""I saw some people wondering if it was the band the Eagles or the team the Eagles. Guys, like, come on, like, I'm from Philly, of course it's the team."" Read next",2023-11-19T11:34:07Z,19.0,11.0,2023.0
214,Business Insider,How a Florida driver fed up with Uber and Lyft created her own shuttle service so she could make more money and work fewer hours,Noah Sheidlower,"       Sherry, 58, was driving upwards of 75 hours a week for Uberand Lyft, struggling to pull in $200 a day. The Florida driver said that when she started six years ago she was easily earning that much working six to eight hours, but has struggled to reach that goal more recently. ""If you make all your drivers mad, you're not going to have any left,"" said Sherry, who asked to just use her first name for fear of professional repercussions. ""The more people that I talk to, they don't want to do it anymore, and they're trying to find other things to do on their own so that they don't have to drive."" Now, she's trying something different. She launched a shuttle service that she advertises on Facebook and through word of mouth. She charges $50 to take people to and from the cruise terminal near her home, and she now works fewer hours and spends more time with family. ""Everybody's trying to do their own thing, whether they're a social media influencer or starting their own car detailing business,"" she said. ""Recently, because of inflation, a lot more people are trying to drive, figuring even if I get an extra $100 a week, that's groceries or the electric bill."" She's right. Millions of Americans are looking to gig jobs like ridehailing apps,grocery delivery, and digital freelancing as an alternative to the 9-to-5 office job. US gig workers are estimated to havemore than doubledsince the start of the pandemic. But as manygig driverssearch formore stability, many are struggling to put food on the table as their earnings fall and competition grows. This has led some to abandon gig work entirely or start their own businesses. Sherry, a mother of seven, started driving in 2017 while still working at a pharmacy. She transitioned to full-time driving in 2019 after she reported feeling overworked and underpaid at her pharmacy job. ""That way I could create my own schedule, could go see my kids more when I wanted, and I could travel more,"" Sherry said. ""It seemed to work out really well the first couple of years that I did it. I couldn't have been happier."" Pre-pandemic, she worked 30 to 40 hours a week Monday through Friday, and she said it was fairly easy to make ends meet. When the pandemic struck, she drove essential workers to and from work, and the platforms offered substantial bonuses at the time. She noticed thatcompetition for rideswas accelerating, though, and she started making less for her rides as the years progressed. Shesaid she's needed to work 12 to 14 hours each day — 18 hours one day — to make a similar amount to what she would make in around half the time a few years ago. ""I do this for the freedom to set my own schedule, but it's coming at a price,"" Sherry said. ""I don't even have freedom anymore because now I have to drive so much, I basically don't have a life."" Last year, she had a gross payment of over $98,000 from Uber for nearly 4,000 completed trips, though her net payout was only $55,000 after fees, expenses, and taxes. This year, her net payout for the first 10 months of the year is around $28,500 for nearly 2,000 trips. Sherry said she struggled to pay her bills as rides dry up. Some days recently, she would only make $100 in seven or eight hours — or about minimum wage in Florida. ""Your body takes a huge toll. It's just terrible sitting in the car all day long,"" Sherry said. ""My muscles are becoming weak, and I'm gaining weight because I'm not getting out and walking around."" She said a few years ago, there would only be six or seven drivers waiting at the airport at a time for rides, but now there's over 40. One day, she recalled 220 cars waiting when there were only 40 flights coming in that day. Some days, she waited nearly two hours for an airport trip, only for it to pay $7. ""Airport trips used to be my bread and butter, but now it's all just changed,"" she said. Additionally, a few weeks ago, Sherry was offered a Lyft ride for $50.69 that was almost two hours and 115 miles. While she would make around $25 an hour for the trip itself, the amount she'd pay in gas there and back would amount to just $7 an hour for the four-hour round trip. Lower earnings, coupled with rising car maintenance costs, have led her to search for other work. She said the price for a set of tires doubled from $400 to $850 in her area. While on a cruise earlier this year, Sherry said she heard passengers complain about how they couldn't find a shuttle to and from the cruise port. So last month, Sherry decided to supplement her income from Uber and Lyft by starting a freelance shuttle service, an extension of some freelance airport trips she did last year. ""People used to tip pretty good, but now, it's few and far between if you actually get a tip anymore. I'm better off doing my own thing,"" she said. She created a digital business card for her shuttle business and posted in Facebook groups offering her services. When she heard about the prices ridehailing companies were charging to get to the cruise ports — some charged upwards of $90 one way — she decided to charge $50 each way. She could pocket all $50, whereas a comparable Uber ride she said would only give her $30. She's made between $1,500 and $1,700 a week doing shuttle driving alongside Uber and Lyft rides. Although many Facebook groups ban advertisers, she's had some luck responding to comments for people looking for rides. Some days, she's making $500 working fewer hours than she would for $200 with Uber and Lyft. ""The clientele I have is different too because I'm driving tourists, and they're more apt to tip,"" Sherry said. ""If I'm just driving regular people, they don't want to tip as much or they can't afford to tip."" She said it's hard to build legitimacy without being backed by a larger company, though she said her business is no different than getting in an Uber with a driver you don't know. Word of mouth has been her friend recently, she said. It's allowed her to take off three or four days a week, she said. She's only driving for Uber and Lyft a few hours each week as she tries to get her name out there. ""I still have the flexibility so I can go visit my kids, and if I want to I can take a cruise,"" Sherry said. ""My life is getting better now that I'm getting away from Uber.""

215,Business Insider,The stock market incorrectly priced in dovish Fed pivots 6 times in the last few years. Will this 7th time be any different?,Filip De Mott,"       The stock market has been on a tear over the last month on hopes for a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve, but investors have seen this movie before. In fact, markets have incorrectly priced in such a pivot six times over the last two years, according to Deutsche Bank, which sounded cautious about this seventh time. Since late October, the S&P 500 has soared 9% amid signs of weaker job growth andcooler-than-expected inflation,convincing many on Wall Street that the Fed's tightening cycle is over, withfed funds futures even indicatinggreater odds of a rate cut as soon as March. In a note Wednesday, Deutsche Bank recounted the previous six head-fakes and laid out what to consider this time: 1. November 2021: Omicron scare Before the Fed launched its tightening cycle in March 2022, central bankers had telegraphed rate hikes were coming. But the emergence of the COVID Omicron variant in November 2021fueled fearof new economic turmoil. As worries mounted that the variant could evade vaccines,investors initially retreated. But then the S&P 500rebounded to hit all-time highs by late December 2021 as markets pushed back the expected timing of the first hike. 2. Spring 2022: Ukraine war Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 drove concerns that the conflict would expand and hamper global growth, prompting the Fed to start with a lower-than-expected hike in March. The S&P 500 advanced 3.6% that month as bond yields fell. 3. May 2022: Even more risks The combination of China's zero-COVID policies, the Ukraine war, and the start of Fed rate hikes fueled doubts about how hawkish the central bank would get. The S&P 500 jumped 6.6% in the week ending May 27, its strongest weekly performance of 2022. 4. July 2022: Global recession? Expectations for a global recession rose, and falling oil prices helped pull down inflation readings, with Chairman Jerome Powell even indicating that rate hikes may need to be slowed. The S&P 500 rallied 9.1% that month. 5. Fall 2022: UK budget fiasco The UK'sproposed budgetthat included more borrowing sent its financial markets into chaos as bond yields soared. That led to expectations the Fed would soon stop hiking and then start cutting in 2023. The S&P 500 surged 5.7% over October 3-4, marking the biggest two-day rally since April 2020. 6. March 2023: Banking chaos The suddencollapse of the Silicon Valley Bankconvinced investors that the Fed would hold off on tighter policy and then startcutting in November. Yields on 2-year Treasurys tumbled, and the S&P 500 jumped 7% from a low in the immediate aftermath of SVB's collapse to the end of the March. What about this time? Today's confidence in imminent Fed cuts could finally prove true, but Deutsche Bank pointed out that the final stretch in bringing inflation to the 2% target rate tends to be the most difficult. By contrast, when inflation peaks, it's often driven by temporary factors, such as an energy shock or supply-chain disruptions, it added. ""But as inflation begins falling, the debate increasingly turns to the risk of over-tightening, and whether policy risks being too restrictive,"" analysts wrote. ""It is difficult to know the answer in real time, since monetary policy operates with a lag. So with markets pricing a pivot for a 7th time, it's worth considering whether the conditions are actually in place for that to happen.""

216,Washington Post,"Rosalynn Carter, first lady who championed mental health, dies at 96",Kevin Sullivan and Kevin Sullivan,"Rosalynn Carter, a close political and policy adviser to her husband, President Jimmy Carter, who created the modern Office of the First Lady and advocated for better treatment of the mentally ill during her years in the White House and for four decades afterward, died Nov. 19 at her home in Plains, Ga. She was 96. The Carter Center in Atlanta, which announced her death, had revealed in May that she had dementia. On Friday, two days before her death, the center said she was in hospice care at home. The Carters had been married for more than 77 years, the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history, and spent the final months of their time together at the family home in the town of Plains, in southwest Georgia. The former president decided in February to stop medical treatment for an aggressive form of melanoma skin cancer. During her husband’s 1976 presidential campaign, Mrs. Carter acquired the label “steel magnolia,” a reference to hersoft-spoken Southern demeanor that disguised an ambitious and resolute nature. Determined not to be relegated to a ceremonial role, she worked in the tradition of former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt to make herself an extension of the president and his policies. She was the first first lady to maintain an office in the East Wing of the White House and only the second, after Roosevelt, to testify in Congress. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter passed away at the age of 96 on Nov. 19, 2023 in her home in Plains, Ga. (Video: Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) In May and June 1977, President Jimmy Carter dispatched his wife on a diplomatic trip to Latin America that was substantive rather than social and unprecedented for a first lady. Her grueling trip took her toseven countries and across more than 12,000 miles in 13 days. Her mission was to explain American foreign policy to a part of the world that her husband believed the United States had neglected. She engaged Central and South American government figures on issues that included human rights, beef exports, arms reduction, demilitarization, drug trafficking and nuclear energy. After each day’s talks, she filed a report with the State Department. At many of her meetings, she spoke in Spanish, having recently completed an intensive language course. Mrs. Carter championed political veteran Sen.Walter F. Mondale(D-Minn.) as her husband’s running mate and worked hard for issues that interested her personally: mental health, elder care and the Equal Rights Amendment. Despite her professional accomplishments, some women doubted the strength of her commitment to feminism. Although she never advocated repealing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively legalizedabortion, she considered abortion objectionable on moral and religious grounds. Mrs. Carter encouraged her husband to bring Menachem Beginof Israeland Anwar Sadatof Egypt together at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland for peace talks in 1978. Dividing her time between Camp David and the White House, she provided support and advice as her husband brokered a historic peace agreement between the two nations. It was Mrs. Carter, responding to plunging poll numbers for the Carter White House in 1979, who suggested to her husband that he shake up his Cabinet and give a “crisis of confidence” speech to the nation. While Jimmy Carter never used the word, it became widely known as the “malaise” speech. In her memoir,“First Lady From Plains”(1984), she described herself as “much more political than Jimmy and … more concerned about popularity and winning reelection.” She said she urged her husband “to postpone certain controversies, such as the Panama Canal treaties or some of the Mideast decisions, until his second term.” She spoke repeatedly of her thirst for victory. “I don’t like to take a chance on losing,” she wrote. “I always want to win!” In a2018 interviewwith The Washington Post, Mrs. Carter said she was more upset than her husband when he lost his 1980 reelection bid to Ronald Reagan. “I hate to lose,” she said. The Carters’ close working relationship began in the farming community of Plains, where they knew each other virtually from birth. They returned to Plains after Jimmy Carter left a promising Navy career to take over the family peanut warehouse when his father died. She was a full partner in every decision her husband made in regard to the business. Years later, in the decades after Jimmy Carter’s loss to Reagan, the couple continued their partnership as co-founders of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization committed to human rights and the elimination of suffering around the world. From Plains to Washington Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on Aug. 18, 1927, on her mother’s family farm outside Plains, then a village of about 600 people. When she was 13, her father, a mechanic and school bus driver, died of leukemia. Left with only a small life insurance policy and a meager pension, her mother made ends meet by taking in sewing and working part time in a grocery store before becoming the Plains postmistress. Rosalynn, the eldest daughter, looked after the younger children, helped with the sewing and earned spending money by shampooing hair in a beauty parlor. She also was valedictorian of her graduating class. She commuted to Georgia Southwestern College, a two-year college in nearby Americus, where she took secretarial courses and was active with the Young Democrats. Her best friend was Ruth Carter, the younger sister of Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter, three years older than Rosalynn, took little notice of his sister’s friend until the summer of 1945, just before he was to return for his final year at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. After one date, the dashing young midshipman announced to his mother that Rosalynn was the girl he intended to marry. Following a whirlwind courtship, they married on July 7, 1946, a few weeks after graduation ceremonies at Annapolis. Rosalynn was a few weeks short of 19; he was 21. The young wife was eager to get out of Plains and looked forward to broader horizons in the company of her naval officer husband. For the next seven years, Mrs. Carter followed her husband to a succession of postings as Jimmy Carter advanced toward becoming a submarine commander. They also had three sons during the years 1947 to 1952. The arc of their married life suddenly changed in 1953, when Mrs. Carter’s father-in-law died of cancer, and Jimmy Carter decided to give up his Navy career and return to the family business in Plains. Rosalynn Carter hated the idea. “I argued, I cried. I even screamed at him,” she wrote in her memoir. “I loved our life in the Navy and the independence I had finally achieved. I knew it would be gone if I went home to live in the same community with my mother and Jimmy’s mother.” Inseparable: On their 75th anniversary, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter celebrate a record-setting love story back where it all started Her tears and screaming were unavailing. In 1954, the Carters returned to Plains. “I thought the best part of my life had ended,” she recalled in her autobiography. “But Jimmy turned to me with a smile and said cheerfully, ‘We’re home!’” They returned to Plains in time to endure one of the worst droughts in Georgia history. The peanut crop failed, the cotton and corn crops burned up, and their income that first year was less than $200. Since there was no money to hire help, they plunged side by side into their work at the warehouse — Rosalynn keeping the books, Jimmy working in the warehouse and drumming up business from area peanut farmers. The rains came in 1955, and the husband-and-wife team gradually turned the business around. In 1962, Jimmy Carter ran for a seat in the Georgia state Senate, and his wife took charge of all his campaign correspondence. After he was elected, she managed the family business during the three months of the year he was away in Atlanta. She also played a major role in his first campaign for governor in 1966, a campaign that resulted in a bitter defeat in the Democratic primaryto Lester Maddox, a fiery segregationist who had made his reputation by waving a pistol and brandishing an ax handle at African Americans who tried to eat at his Atlanta restaurant. A year later, the couple had their fourth child, Amy, who was born a few months after Mrs. Carter turned 40. In addition to her husband and daughter, survivors include three sons, John W. “Jack” Carter, James E. “Chip” Carter III, and Donnel J. “Jeff” Carter; 11 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren. Share this article Share Working behind the scenes During her husband’s early political campaigns, Mrs. Carter was content to work behind the scenes. After he was elected governor in 1970, she developed a newfound confidence in her capacity as the state’s official hostess and in her public-speaking obligations. She developed an interest in mental health issues, in part because of childhood memories of a distant cousin in Plains who was in and out of a state mental institution. She served as a member of the Governor’s Commission to Improve Service for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. She helped establish 134 day-care centers for the state’s mentally disabled residents, and she volunteered at the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta to gain further firsthand experience with the problems of the mentally ill. “In 1971, when we went to the Governor’s Mansion, I had thought we would be going home to Plains in 1975, because the governor of Georgia could not succeed himself,” Mrs. Carter recalled. “But we weren’t. Since early 1972, Jimmy had been quietly planning to run for president.” Carter had been, in essence, measuring himself against potential presidents who happened to come through Georgia and were political guests of the Carters. They included Sens.Edmund S. Muskie(D-Maine),Henry M. “Scoop” Jackson(D-Wash.),George S. Mc Govern(D-S.D.) and Hubert H. Humphrey (Minn.), the Democratic Party’s nominee in 1968. When her husband made his candidacy official, she plunged in as usual in support of his political aspirations, although she recalled that when she told people during the early days of the campaign that he wasrunning for president, she was often asked, “President of what?” She campaigned for 18 months in a total of 42 states. She recalled answering questions about mental health, education, prison reform, the reorganization of government and the price of fertilizer. Running as an outsider with a mandate to clean up Watergate-ridden Washington, the relatively unknown governor from Georgia secured the Democratic nomination and the right to contest the Republican incumbent,Gerald Ford. In the early morning of Nov. 3, 1976, Ford conceded, and Jimmy Carter was elected the 39th president of the United States. Mrs. Carter found life in the White House exhilarating, particularly during the early months, but she continued to maintain the parameters of the working partnership she and her husband had crafted years earlier. Throughout their four years in Washington, she kept the books, wrote the checks and kept track of income tax obligations. With her husband’s support and over the objections of others, Mrs. Carter expanded the role of the first lady. She attended Cabinet meetings, worked on mental health and other policy priorities, and formally created the Office of the First Lady in the East Wing with its own chief of staff. “There are very few people in this administration that I fear,” an unnamed White House staffer told Newsweek. “Rosalynn Carter is at the top of the list.” Mrs. Carter wrote in her memoir: “Once the press and our persistent opponents heard about my attendance at the meetings, very soon it was rumored that I was ‘telling’ Jimmy what to do! They obviously didn’t know Jimmy! But I also think there was a not very subtle implication that Cabinet meetings were no place for a wife. I was supposed to take care of the house — period.” The historic high point of the Carter administration was the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel in 1978. Mrs. Carter recalled that she and her husband expected to stay at Camp David for three or four days as hosts of Begin and Sadat. They stayed 12 days, pushing past dejection, disappointment and dashed hopes to an agreement that outlined a framework for a comprehensive Middle East peace. She was proud of her husband. “Begin and Sadat shared the Nobel Peace Prize that year,” she wrote in her memoir, “but it was Jimmy who had made it possible.”Jimmy Carter receiveda Nobel Peace Prize 24 years later for his post-presidential work on global conflict resolution and human rights advocacy. As first lady, Mrs. Carter continued working on strategies for helping the mentally ill. “I wanted to take mental illnesses and emotional disorders out of the closet, to let people know it is all right to admit having a problem without the fear of being called crazy,” she wrote in her autobiography. “If only we could consider mental illnesses as straightforwardly as we do physical illnesses, those affected could seek help and be treated in an open and effective way.” Her efforts were instrumental in congressional approval and funding for the Mental Health Systems Act of September 1980, the first major reform of federal, publicly funded mental health programs in nearly two decades. “Our celebration was brief,” Mrs. Carter recalled in her book. “Within a month Ronald Reagan was elected president, and with the change of administration, many of our dreams and the bulk of the funding for our program were gone. … It was a bitter loss.” The mental health disappointment came toward the end of the Carter presidency. The beginning of the end was Iran, where, on the morning of Nov. 4, 1979, militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held U.S. diplomats hostage for 444 days. Mrs. Carter urged her husband to immediately enact an oil embargo, but when neither that action nor any other could gain the hostages’ quick release, public opinion turned against the administration. With the president confined to the White House because of the hostage crisis, Mrs. Carter took to the campaign trail. She traveled the country as his representative during the winter and spring primary season of 1980. She also worked to woo supporters of his challenger, Sen.Edward M. Kennedy(D-Mass). On election night, when it was clear that Jimmy Carter would lose overwhelmingly to the Republican nominee, Reagan, a White House staff member mentioned to the president that he didn’t seem bitter. Mrs. Carter responded: “I’m bitter enough for the both of us.” “I meant it,” she wrote in her memoir. “I was bitter at what I had seen on television for weeks that I thought was so unfair to Jimmy; bitter about the hostage situation dominating the news for the last few days before the election as the media ‘celebrated’ the anniversary of the hostage capture; bitter at the opposition for deliberately misleading the American people; bitter that they blamed Jimmy for the hostage crisis when they should have praised him for his sound judgment and patience.” After Reagan’s inauguration in January 1981, the Carters went home to Plains, to the house they had built two decades earlier. Leaving the White House much sooner than they expected, they were profoundly frustrated by Jimmy Carter’s unfinished agenda and worried about the fate of the nation under Reagan. The former president was 56, the former first lady was 53, and they had to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives, as they recounted in the book they co-wrote, “Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life” (1987). In 1982, they founded the Carter Center, where Mrs. Carter continued her involvement with mental health issues as chairwoman of the center’s Mental Health Task Force. She wrote or co-wrote five books, mainly about caregiving and mental health. She traveled around the world for the Carter Center on trips to promote human rights and peace initiatives and to monitor elections. She and her husband spent a week a year building homes for low-income people with Habitat for Humanity, and they built or remodeled more than 4,300 homes in 14 countries. In the 2018 interviewwith The Post, she said that in a recent remodel of their home in Plains, she and the former president knocked down a bedroom wall themselves rather than letting the contractor do it. “By that time, we had worked with Habitat so much that it was just second nature,” she said. Even well into their 90s, the Carters would walk at least a half-mile a day for exercise on the streets of the town where they both were born, and where they planned to be buried on their land beneath a pretty willow tree. They conducted part of the 2018 interview while walking down West Church Street toward their home. Jimmy Carter pointed out the Plains United Methodist Church, where he first spotted his future wife. They went to a movie, and the next morning Carter told his mother that he was going to marry Rosalynn. “I didn’t know that for years,” she said with a smile, holding his hand. They were asked if they wanted for anything. “I can’t think of anything,” Carter said, turning to his wife. “And you?” “No, I’m happy,” she said.","November 19, 2023 at 3:18 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
217,Washington Post,A midnight trip into northern Gaza reveals total destruction,Steve Hendrix and Steve Hendrix,"GAZA CITY — To enter Gaza now is to arrive in hell. On Saturday night, I crossed through the broken barrier between Israel and Gaza in the back of an Israeli military jeep, going fast without lights under a crescent moon. Before the breach, I was just able to make out the bullet-riddled cars by the roadside, some of the hundreds of civilian vehicles attacked by Hamasfighters who poured through this same fence on Oct. 7. They mark the gateway to war. Soon after we crossed into Gaza — racing over debris-covered roads — the first destroyed buildings appeared. Some were skeletal silhouettes against the stars, windowless and blackened, others mere pancaked stacks of concrete. Further in, the ruins were more tightly packed. These were neighborhoods just weeks ago. Almost no structure was untouched. Explosions sounded regularly. A fire burned on a nearby ridge. Every few miles, the sour stench of decaying bodies rose with the dust. Thousands of people are still believed to be entombed in the rubble. Gaza becomes ‘a graveyard for children’ as Israel intensifies airstrikes Before the war, even during previous wars, donkey carts and Toyotas shouldered past each other in Gaza City’s chaotic intersections. The poorest fishermen powered their boats with cooking oil and sold their catch from blankets on the sidewalk. There was a mall with flashy sneaker stores and a recently opened cat cafe. It was an enclave of poverty and power shortages that also bore a fierce pride of place. Northern Gaza — a vital center of Palestinian culture and identity — has become a smoking, reeking ruin. Hundreds of thousands have fled to the south, leaving a silence broken only by the pop of machine-gun fire and the heavy thrum of Israeli tanks. More than11,000 people have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, but the official number has been frozen for 10 days. Counting the dead is no longer possible, officials say.Communication blackoutsmake it increasingly difficult to reach the living. I entered Gaza with a small group of journalists, escorted by the Israel Defense Forces. Our ultimate destination was al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest health-care facility. Israel is eager to show what it describes as proof that the hospital was doubling as a Hamas military base, particularly a recently discovered tunnel shaft at the edge of the compound — though the evidence remains inconclusive. On this trip, reporters were permitted only a 60-second glimpse into a steeply pitched shaft, which Israeli commanders say is too perilous to enter. How Israel built its case to raid Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital Getting there would take hours — in jeeps first, and then an armored personnel carrier — in the company of heavily armed soldiers. To gain access to Gaza, which is blockaded by Israel and Egypt, The Washington Post agreed not to disclose locations or details of certain military operations and equipment or to photograph soldiers’ faces. We were with the military for the entire six hours inside the enclave and were not permitted to seek out locals to interview, though there were no Gazans to be seen. Israeli officials did not review The Post’s reporting before publication. No Hamas fighters tried to stop our convoy across Gaza. Israel’s occupation of this part of the enclave seems firm, its forces everywhere. “In some areas, we have gained complete control,” said a lieutenant colonel, the deputy commander of the 7th Armored Brigade. “In denser areas it is more difficult.” Like others in this piece, he spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with IDF rules. I’ve made many trips to Gaza during my four years as The Post’s bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories. Entering the Strip has always been difficult. I last came in September, navigating the gantlet of Israeli, Hamas and Palestinian Authority checkpoints to reach this parallel universe of deprivation and isolation. It was just weeks before the Hamas attack, when the horrors of the past month and a half were still beyond imagining, even for those deeply steeped in this long and brutal conflict. But there were clues. During that 10-day stay, my Gazan colleague Hazem Balousha and I were told that the summer of relative calm in Gaza — as violence spiked in the occupied West Bank — was beginning to fray. “It has been quiet, but it is beginning to boil,” Basem Naim, head of Hamas’s Political and International Relations Department, told us. “There is a lot of pressure under the water.” We noticed an unusual amount of automatic weapons fire coming from a Hamas training area north of Gaza City, not far from where Balousha has a small fruit orchard. In a Sept. 21 storythat now seems chillingly prescient, we reported that Hamas was said to be drilling its fighters on rocket launches, kidnapping soldiers and “storming settlements.” It was one of the last international press dispatches from Gaza before Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed southern Israel —killingsome 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and taking more than230 hostages, including children and the elderly. Hamas envisioned deeper attacks, aiming to provoke an Israeli war Gaza’s summer of peace — and Israel’s sense of security — has given way to unprecedented destruction on both sides of the barrier. On this return visit, as the jeeps sped through the blackness, it was impossible not to think of the captives still being held somewhere in this unrecognizable warscape. Or perhaps beneath it. “In this area, we think there is a Gaza beneath Gaza, said the lieutenant colonel, who has been fighting in Gaza since Israeli ground troops entered in late October. He was referring to the network of tunnels that Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials said lace the limestone beneath these neighborhoods, a labyrinth described as essential to Hamas’s guerrilla tactics. “The terrorist will come out of one building to fight, and then disappear and come out of another building,” he said. “The same terrorist.” The colonel had led some of the forces that cut straight across Gaza to the Mediterranean shore in the first days of the ground invasion. Saturday’s jeep ride ended on that beach. Not far away was the Roots Hotel, now largely destroyed, which had been our frequent base on visits here. I had never been to Gaza without Balousha by my side. Fortunately, he and his young family — who were displaced five times in the first weeks of bombing and spent a night sleeping on the sidewalk near al-Shifa — managed to cross into Egypt. He continues to report from Amman, Jordan. We transferred to a hulking personnel carrier for the final passage to al-Shifa, its massive ramp closing with an ear-popping pressurized hiss. There were no windows, but the monitors presented a ghostly white survey of crumbled buildings as we crept down streets stripped of pavement. The machine rolled into and out of a crater as its cameras swiveled back and forth in search of threats. Disembarking at al-Shifa, we saw some of the only lighted buildings of our journey. A window glowed in the main structure and even more glowed in the emergency wing. We entered about a hundred yards from those buildings, through a blasted wall in a hospital supply area, never seeing any of the hundreds of patients and caregivers still in the wards. Israeli troops scour Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital for evidence of Hamas For weeks, the hospital has been collapsing, slowly at first and then with catastrophic speed, as the dead and injured overwhelmed the wards and staff ran out of water, medicine and fuel. Doctors operated on dirty floors without anesthesia and bodies were buried in a mass grave in the hospital courtyard. A U.N. team, led by the World Health Organization,describedthe facility as “a death zone” after a brief tour on Saturday. “Signs of gunfire and shelling were evident,” the WHO said in a statement. Medical staff reported heavy fighting in the hours after Israeli troops first stormed al-Shifa early Wednesday. The IDF told The Post that its forces have “not fired a shot” inside the compound and have provided the hospital with food, water and medical supplies. Israel brought journalists on this risky trip because officials are adamant to prove the case they’ve been pressing for weeks: That Hamas uses hospitals as shields for military operations, even as thousands of wounded and displaced civilians rely on them for treatment and shelter. Medical workers and the militant group have denied the accusations. Many facilities, besieged and surrounded, have already been forced to shut down or evacuate. On Oct. 27, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that al-Shifa concealed a vast Hamas subterranean headquarters, accessed through secret entrances to underground tunnels. He showed an animated video of what allegedly lay below. It was the “beating heart” of Hamas operations, another official said. Before the raid, U.S. officials declassified intelligence that they said supported Israel’s conclusions about al-Shifa. On Saturday, Hagari said the uncovered shaft was clear evidence of Hamas infrastructure, but he also seemed to play down its significance. “I talked about Shifa Hospital, it’s on record,” he said. “I said ‘It’s notthecommand and control [center], like [top Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar is sitting down there with [his top deputy] Marwan Issa.’ It’s for seniors, for brigade commanders.” Forbidden from using flashlights in an area where soldiers had battled Hamas just hours before, we felt our way over rubble and tangled cables. We held red safety lights up to interview a masked special forces soldier who described breaching the wall of a storage area in the hospital complex, searching for Hamas fighters, then finding a car packed with weapons nearby. Israel says its forces found the tunnel shaft when they detonated the explosives in the car and a military bulldozer involved in the action revealed the opening. Gunshots sounded nearby as we moved toward the opening. The CNN cameraman was permitted to turn on a white light for about a minute to film, revealing how precariously we were crowded around the sloped, debris-littered shaft. Earlier, before we entered Gaza, Hagari showed the group a video that troops had recently made by lowering a remote camera into the shaft. At the bottom, past a spiral metal stairway, a long horizontal tunnel is shown, ending at a heavy door. Hagari said that the passage was likely to be booby-trapped and that engineers were looking for ways to investigate safely — to protect Israeli troops and possibly hostages, two of whom were recently discovered dead in nearby houses, he said. Israel says the shaft is a portal to the wider Hamas tunnel network, a claim The Post cannot independently confirm. Pressure is mounting on the IDF to make a more conclusive case, to justify the humanitarian toll of its attacks in and around hospitals in Gaza — where the total death toll since the war began is more than 11,000 — and to claim a military victory as a deal to pause the fighting and free hostages hangs in the balance. U.S. close to deal with Israel and Hamas to pause conflict, free some hostages On the ride back in the personnel carrier, the Israeli colonel showed videos on his phone of Hamas fighters attaching magnetic explosives to an IDF tank, killing two soldiers. He described how militants launched rocket-propelled grenades from the lower and upper stories of apartment buildings, and how IDF troops had begun shooting rapidly, both high and low, when they entered traffic junctions. Asked how those tactics comported with Israel’s pledge to protect civilians, the colonel cited several steps the IDF has taken, from warning residents to leave northern Gaza to halting actions each day along a major evacuation route. Ultimately, he returned to Hamas’s brutality on Oct. 7. “This is a war zone,” he said. “We didn’t want to be here, but Hamas gave us no choice.” The sky was even blacker when our jeep convoy finally crossed back into Israel. It had been a dark ride from one traumatized population to another.","November 19, 2023 at 1:11 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
218,Washington Post,Trump-like libertarian Javier Milei wins Argentina’s presidency,Samantha Schmidt and Samantha Schmidt,"BUENOS AIRES — A radical libertarian and admirer of Donald Trumprode a wave of voter rage to win Argentina’s presidency on Sunday, crushing the political establishment and bringing the sharpest turn to the right in four decades of democracy in the country. Javier Milei, a 53-year-old far-right economist and former television pundit with no governing experience, claimed nearly 56 percent of the vote in a stunning upset over Sergio Massa, the center-left economy minister who has struggled to resolve the country’s worst economic crisis in two decades. Even before the official results had been announced Sunday night, Massa acknowledged defeat and congratulated Milei on his win. Trump also congratulated Milei. “I am very proud of you,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “You will turn your Country around and Make Argentina Great Again!” Voters in this nation of 46 million demanded a drastic change from a government that has sent the peso tumbling, inflation skyrocketing and more than 40 percent of the population into poverty. With Milei, Argentina takes a leap into the unknown — with a leader promising to shatter the entire system. In his first speech as president-elect, Milei told Argentines that “the model of decadence has reached its end. There is no turning back.” “Enough of the impoverishing power of the caste,” he said. “Today we once again embrace the model of liberty, to once again become a world power.” His supporters joined him in shouting: “Long live freedom, damn it!” Milei will take office on Dec. 10, the 40th anniversary of Argentina’s return to democracy after the fall of its military dictatorship. Wielding chain saws on the campaign trail, the wild-haired Milei vowed to slash public spending in a country heavily dependent on government subsidies. He pledged to dollarize the economy, shut down the central bank and cut the number of government ministries from 18 to eight. His rallying campaign cry was a takedown of the country’s political “caste” — an Argentine version of Trump’s “drain the swamp.” Will a Trump-like candidate win in Argentina? The election, explained. Massa was emblematic of that ruling elite — “the king of the caste,” political analyst Pablo Touzón said. The career politician attempted to distance himself from the leftist government of Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the heirs to the populist dynasty first launched by Juan and Eva “Evita” Perón in the 1940s. Along with a grass-roots campaign of activists, Massa sought to stoke fear over a Milei presidency they argued could threaten Argentina’s democracy and way of life. But ultimately,anger won over fear. For many Argentines, the bigger risk was more of the same. “We don’t have anything to lose,” Tomás Limodio, said a 36-year-old business owner who voted for Milei in Buenos Aires on Sunday. “We’ve had this type of government for so many years, and things are only getting worse.” Acknowledging his defeat Sunday night, Massa told supporters the results were “not what we had hoped for” and marked the end of a political chapter of his life. At the campaign headquarters, supporters consoled each other. A young woman burst into tears. “There were two paths,” Massa said. “We chose the path of the defense of the security system in the hands of the state … the path of the defense of education and public health as central values. Argentines chose the other path.” Milei’s landslide victory makes him the most-voted president in a runoff since the return of democracy in Argentina. The results suggest that many of those who said they would vote in blank, and did not feel represented by either candidate, ended up choosing Milei, political analyst Mariel Fornoni said. “Evidently, people were not afraid to change,” she said. A Milei presidency brings the far right to power in the third-largest economy in Latin America, and it could have profound implications for the region and the world. In a continent dominated by leftist leaders, Milei could create tensions with governments he has attacked, including crucial trading partner and neighbor Brazil. In an era of growing Chinese influence in Latin America, Milei could become the region’s most vocal antagonist to a country he once called “an assassin.” Milei made a name for himself as a television pundit who insulted other guests, and he has shown a tendency to fight with the news media. He has circulated conspiracy theories and raised unsubstantiated claims about electoral fraud. In presidential debates, he has cast doubt on the widely accepted tally of murders during the country’s Dirty War from 1976 to 1983. He has branded Pope Francis, an Argentine, an “evil” leftist. Climate change, he says, is a “socialist lie.” He would hold a referendum to undo the three-year-old law thatlegalized abortion. Catholic priests are warning about Argentina’s Trump. Will it stop him? Many Argentines chose to overlook the Milei messages that made them uncomfortable. For some, a vote for the outsider was a reluctant yet strategic one. “The thinking is well, maybe since Milei is crazy, he’ll launch himself like a kamikaze” and make necessary reforms that previous leaders refused to make, in fear of getting kicked out of power, Touzón said. “Let’s use the crazy man to make the reforms that the rational ones didn’t want to make.” For 16 of the past 20 years, Argentina has been governed by the powerful populist machine known as Peronism. The country’s leaders have left a once-wealthy nation — but often volatile economy — in its worst shape in two decades. “We are living what we could call a second lost decade,” economist Matías Surt said. For only the second time in its history, Argentina has seen 10 years without economic growth. During that decade, poverty rates shot up from 28 percent to more than 40 percent. Now, for the first time ever, even formal workers in Argentina’s economy are below the poverty line. Inflation is nearing 150 percent. The peso has plummeted, prices change nearly weekly, and Argentines are forced to carry around large wads of cash just to buy groceries. With his viral Tik Tok videos and outlandish personality, Milei rallied a generation of young voters who have felt these frustrations for most of their lives. Today’s youngest voters only know an Argentina in economic decline. They have lived through the covid-19 pandemic, and they see the political left as the establishment, rather than the revolution it once was. John Flores, 24, and his wife don’t know if they’ll ever be able to buy their own home. Flores, a nursing student, relies on his wife’s income and occasional odd jobs as a bricklayer or janitor to pay the rent and support an infant. Their money is worth less every day. Saving has become impossible. “Massa wants to fix the problems that he himself created,” Flores said. “We’re tired, especially the young people.” Argentina’s tear-it-all-down frontrunner connects with angry young men The question is whether Milei will be able to fulfill his mandate with strapped financial resources, no governing experience and few political allies in the legislature. Even compared with Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former Brazilian president, “Argentina will have the most outsider of outsiders that has existed in recent years,” Touzón said. Milei will take office as the “weakest” president in the 40 years since the country’s return to democracy, said Argentine political analyst Lucas Romero. This is not only because he lacks a majority in Congress, but also because he owes at least part of his triumph to a former president, Mauricio Macri, whose endorsement in the weeks before the vote gave Milei the political backing and credibility he previously lacked. His triumph is expected to have a seismic effect on Argentina’s economy in the coming days. His proposals for dollarization have sent Argentines rushing to shed their pesos, causing the currency’s value to plunge. “We are going to have a dark week,” said Damian Rodríguez, a 42-year-old salesman who held off on posting his most expensive kitchen appliances for sale online this week, waiting to see how prices would fluctuate after a possible Milei win. Veronica Cerminaro, a 44-year-old public sector employee, worried that a Milei presidency would leave her country in ruins. In Milei, she said, she saw an “anti-democratic” candidate who negates the horrors of the military dictatorship and who wants to take away her rights and those of her children. “Along with all of the other crazy ideas he has,” she said. “With that man, I don’t see a future for anyone.” But for Jonathan Aguero, a 32-year-old, the future has looked bleak for quite some time now. The father of two who works in safety inspections has felt shortchanged by his country’s economic troubles for his entire life. “I have three jobs, and it’s never enough,” he said, holding his six-month-old daughter after voting in a working-class neighborhood of Buenos Aires. “We’ve already seen what Peronism has done. We need a change.","November 19, 2023 at 9:46 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
219,Washington Post,Is it true that thawing a turkey on the counter can make you sick?,Lindsey Bever and Lindsey Bever,"Thawing a frozen raw turkey on the kitchen countertop can cause food poisoning. A thawing raw turkey can contaminate your hands, kitchen surfaces and food withsalmonellaor other pathogens that can resultin serious illness. Food safety experts say the safest place to thaw a turkey isin the refrigerator, inside its original packaging and placed in a pan. Besides the refrigerator, the U.S. Department of Agriculturesays it’s safe to thaw a turkey in a sink full of consistently cold water or in the microwave. But we know people ignore this advice and still thaw turkeys in all sorts of ways, including on the counter.So we asked experts if there is a safe way to counter-thaw. Some said it is scientifically possible, but only if you carefully manage and monitor the turkey’s temperature. When the turkey reaches the “danger zone” — temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit — bacteria multiply quickly. Here’s how Benjamin Chapman, department head of agricultural and human sciences at North Carolina State University, steers clear: Chapman said he worries about the risk of cross-contamination in his refrigerator because there is not enough space for a large turkey. Cramming one in increases the risk that the turkey or the juices leaking out of it will come into contact with other items, including fruits and vegetables. Donald Schaffner, chair of the department of food science at Rutgers University, agrees that thawing on the counter can be done safely as long as the turkey stays out of the “danger zone.” He notes that precautions have to be taken with any method, including the refrigerator. “No matter what you do, there are trade-offs,” he said. There’s not much research on counter thawing — partly because for decades, the consensus has been that other methods are safer and more predictable, said Keith Schneider, a professor in the food science and human nutrition department at the University of Florida. But a 1968 USDA study showed that a12- to 14-pound turkey thawed in a 70-degree room, while wrapped in a double-walled paper bag for insulation, kept its surface temperature at40 degrees. A spokesperson for the USDAsaid it would be difficult to estimate how long a turkey could safely sit on the counter. Turkeys vary in size and homes vary in temperature. That’s why the agency and most experts strongly advise against it. How to thaw a turkey To reduce the risk of cross-contamination, follow these tips: Make sure to cook your turkey until it reaches 165 degrees, as measured by a food thermometer in the deepest parts of the bird. How to safely defrost meats, soups, baked goods and more Although it’s scientifically possible tosafelythaw a turkey on the counter, it’s a complicated process that goes against official recommendations.To minimize risk, refrigerator-thawing in a container is the simplest and safest approach. “It takes a lot of the guesswork out of things,” said Robert Gravani, professor emeritus of food science at Cornell University.

220,Washington Post,"From airlines to ticket sellers, companies fight U.S. to keep junk fees",Tony Romm and Tony Romm,"Frustrated with airlines that charge passengers steep fees to check bags and change flights,President Bidenlast fall embarked on a campaign tocrack downon the practice — and force companies to show the full price of travel before people pay for their tickets. Fliers rejoiced, flooding the Department of Transportation with letters urging it to adopt the policy. Airlines including American, Delta and United, however, did not seem so enthused. It would be too difficult to disclose the charges more clearly, warned Doug Mullen, the deputy general counsel at Airlines for America, an industry lobbying group representing the three carriers. Testifying at afederal hearingin March, he said the new policy would only cause customers “confusion and frustration” — and, besides, the extra costs for bags and other services historically have resulted in “very few complaints.” “The department should not regulate in this area,” Mullen added. Since then, the Biden administration has broadened its efforts to expose or eliminate “junk fees” throughout the economy, touching off a groundswell of opposition from airlines, auto dealers, banks, credit card companies, cable giants, property owners and ticket sellers that hope to preserve their profits. Behind the scenes, these corporations have fought vigorously to thwart even the most basic rules that would require them to be more transparent about hidden charges, according to a Washington Post review of federal lobbying records and hundreds of filings submitted to government agencies. The fees together may cost Americans at least $64 billion annually, according to a rough White House estimate, underscoring its efforts to deliver financial relief to families grappling with high prices. Over the past year, federal regulators have tried to limit credit card late fees in a bid to protect the most cash-strapped borrowers from penalties they cannot easily pay. But the companies that issue those cards — and reaped over$14.5 billion in fees last year— have aggressively fought back, foreshadowing a lawsuit against the government to come. Charter, Comcast and other cable giants similarly have warred with Washington through their lobbying groups, bucking federal efforts to ensure they present accurate, complete data about service charges. So have some casinos,insurersand the owners of largeapartment buildings, which have fiercely fought new federal regulations that might punish them if they conceal their true prices. Some ticket sellers have called for new rules that would require them to display the full, total price of a performance up front, including any service fees. But some companies still do not fully adhere to the practice: Ticketmaster, for example, only does so for some shows, though its parent company, Live Nation, promised the White House to be more transparent earlier this year. Spokespeople for American, Delta and United referred questions to their trade group, Airlines for America, where spokeswoman Hannah Walden said in a statement that the industry offers “transparency and choice to consumers from first search to touchdown.” The industry last year collected more than $6.7 billion inbaggage fees, according to the Department of Transportation. Dan Wall, the executive vice president for corporate and regulatory affairs at Live Nation said the company cannot force venues it doesn’t own to be more transparent about fees. He called for federal rules that lay out what companies must disclose, and how, which would ensure “everybody does it so that nobody is disadvantaged for doing the right thing.” ‘They don’t like being taken for suckers’ For Biden, the regulatory push marks one facet of a broader battle against soaring prices,three years after the coronavirus pandemicsent the cost of groceries, gas, rents and other goods soaring. The administration views some of those price spikes as the result of corporate profiteering, as companies look to squeeze their customers in a bid to pump their bottom lines. The concern prompted the president starting last year to target “junk fees,” taking aim at airlines, cable companies, hotels and ticket brokers that charge consumers for services they do not want, need or expect to pay for. “We know that junk fees resonate with American consumers. They don’t like being taken for suckers,” said Lael Brainard, the director of the White House National Economic Council. “And we’re going to continue our efforts to make sure that across all industries consumers have the right to see all-in pricing right up front.” Much of that work has occurred at the Federal Trade Commission, the independent government agency thatpolices deceptivecorporate behavior. This month, the FTCunveiled a proposalthat would require hotels, landlords, ticket brokers and other companies to disclose extra charges up front to consumers. The draft rules do not outlaw all fees, but they would prohibit firms from hiding or misrepresenting the charges, opening the door for the government to penalize businesses that do not comply. “Consumers have become fed up with these hidden fees,” said Samuel Levine, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC. “If a consumer is led to believe something costs $10, and it costs $20, they’ve been misled.” The announcement drew sharp rebukes from a wide array of industries, many of which have sought to block the watchdog agency’s efforts since it first announced its inquiry last year. In legal filings with the commission, alobbying groupfor Facebook, Google and other advertising platforms said in February the FTC had not presented “sufficient empirical evidence” that junk fees actually pose a problem. The American Gaming Association, whose board of directors includes executives from MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and other casinos, told the government it should be “excluded” from the new rules. And the National Automobile Dealers Associationblasted the FTC for considering “breathtakingly broad” regulations, at one point posing the existential question, “what, exactly, is a ‘fee’?” A similar backlash has greeted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over its push to cut credit card late fees. Consumers that fall behind on their bills can face apenalty as high as $41 per month, an amount that can result in some of the most cash-starved Americans falling deeper into debt. The fees have proved lucrative for credit card issuers, which reaped more than $130 billion last year in these charges plus interest on unpaid balances, according to an Octoberreport fromthe CFPB. That prompted the agency to propose limiting late fees, which could drop to $8 per missed payment. Companies could charge more, but they would face heightened federal scrutiny. “Penalties have to be reasonable and enforceable,” said Rohit Chopra, the director of the CFPB, in an interview this month. “Essentially, they’re not supposed to be the profit engine of the credit card company.” Tens of thousands of credit card holders have cheered the bureau since it unveiled its plans, which arrived on the heels of its efforts to limit bankoverdraft feesand penalize companies, including Wells Fargo, for surprising their customers with unexpected charges. Facing a similar crackdown, a wide array of financial institutions quickly mounted a vigorous defense, with some arguing it would pose a “moral hazard” if cardholders were not penalized for lateness. Share this article Share The opponents included Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Visa, which sounded off through their industrylobbying groups, including the American Bankers Association. In May, the organizationjoined two othersin telling the CFPB that a limit on late feeswould forcethem to lessen the rewards they offer to new and existing customers. Those organizations also questioned whether the bureau had the legal authority to act in the first place, raising the potential they could try to challenge its rules later in court. “The late fees are imposed because they work to deter late payment,” the ABA and its allies told the agency. The CFPB expects to finalize its credit card fee limit early next year. In the meantime, the vociferous opposition has underscored a harsh reality: Even the most popular acts of government threaten to become mired in intractable legal fights, potentially delaying or denying financial relief to Americans. “Consumers might not benefit while the issue is in litigation, which can last for years,” said John Breyault, a vice president of public policy at the National Consumers League. Even before they targeted junk fees, the nation’s two consumer protection watchdogs faced a slew of lawsuits that saw judges curtail their authorities to act. With the CFPB, lenders challenged its constitutionality in a case awaiting a Supreme Court ruling. The FTC, meanwhile, suffered a blow when a majority of the justices nullified one of its powers to fine corporate wrongdoers. This time,Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said both agencies had again overstepped their authorities in pursuing “price controls.” The group, whose board of directors includes executives from Comcast, Hilton and Delta, is weighing legal challenges that could hold up or negate some of the new regulations. “We would consider a legal challenge depending on the contours of whatever they ultimately propose,” Bradley said. A top lobbying group for cable giants including Comcast and Charter have laid the early groundwork for a similar lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission, which is weighing rules to demystify the vague fees that appear on monthly consumer bills. The organization, known as NCTA, told the FCC earlier this year that it “lacks authority” to act. Asked about the claim, Brian Dietz, a senior vice president at the group, said “every legal option is on the table for this” and for “other proceedings the FCC is pursuing.” ‘Companies are making billions of junk fees’ Amid a torrent of legal threats, Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass a comprehensive bill that sets the rules for when and how companies can charge extra fees. But even some of the more popular, bipartisan efforts to promote price transparency have faltered in an ever-divided, heavily lobbied Capitol. A proposal from two unlikely allies, Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), would mandate that ticket sellers show their full prices upfront. The duo released the Ticket Actthis summer, after a public outcry aboutmajor outages and steep feeson Ticketmaster sales for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.But the bill remains stuck in the upper chamber after Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) blocked a vote out of a belief that such regulation is unnecessary, according to two legislative aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe his stance. The inaction has emboldened some states, including California, to adopt their own laws, while Biden has tried to use the power of the Oval Office to pressure companies into changing their practices even without new legislation. In June, thepresident secureda commitment froman array of companies, including Ticketmaster, to more clearly show their service fees to consumers. Speaking at a White House roundtable that month, Biden heralded the announcement as “real transparency,” stressing it “leads to more competition” and “brings down costs for working Americans.” In practice, though, the Ticketmaster policy has proven more complex: Only concerts listed for sale starting in late September show the full price of a ticket, including fees, by default. That full price only applies to venues owned by Live Nation, not the fuller array of performances sold through Ticketmaster. In those cases, the company requires users to check a box to see a full price for shows, with the option hidden behind a menu where customers may not think to look. As a result, fans who wish to see popular artists like Doja Cat and Kesha this year may still see price spikes once they reach the checkout page. Wall, the Live Nation executive, said Ticketmaster cannot force other venues to display fees for a show by default. He said it would also be “difficult and disruptive” to change the way it prices performances that started selling tickets before the company implemented its new pledge to the White House. Laura Dooley, the head of global government relations for Stub Hub, said the company similarly allows consumers to turn on a feature to see the full prices of shows. The seller previously tried to include fees in its ticket prices by default in 2014 — only to be burned because its competitors did not, creating the impression that prices on Stub Hub were higher. Some critics still faulted Ticketmaster for its approach: Chuck Bell, a program director at Consumer Reports, lamented that it “goes against the spirit” of the company’s promise to the administration. Last month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) faulted Live Nation and Ticketmaster in apublic letter, noting that it is “still too difficult for consumers to find the all-in price of a ticket before checkout.” The White House has reserved most of its ire for top airlines, lambasting them for a raft of fees that Biden has described as costly and unfair. In his State of the Union address, the president explicitly blastedmajor carriersfor charging families extra to sit next to each other, prompting companies including American, Alaska and Frontier toend the practice soon after. The Department of Transportation has also tried to set new rules around how airlinesprocess refundsand handle flight cancellations, and the ways they charge fees to check bags, change flights and more. The effort at times has sparked widespread resistance from an industry that reaped nearly $7 billion in baggage fees just last year, government figures show. Under the early draft proposal, airlines like American, Delta, United and Southwest would have to display the “all-in” cost of a flight, including any fees, before passengers see their final invoice. The transparency rules could also apply to travel search engines, like Google or Kayak, which allow fliers to look up flight options across many carriers at once, though the agency has not finalized the scope of its regulations. “You should know the full cost of your ticket right when you’re comparison shopping to begin with,”Biden said last September, noting it would help families “pick the ticket that actually is the best deal for you.” Like much of the administration’s work, the plan would not outlaw any of the fees, since the agency lacks such authority. Butair carrierssoon told the Department of Transportation repeatedly that its work to require transparency may be illegal and unworkable anyway. Airlines for America, the top industry lobbying group, at one point shared aslide deckwith the agency this March saying the government had no data to “demonstrate substantial harm” to passengers, who do not see bag charges as a “meaningful decision” when they first search for a flight. A top official at American Airlinestold the agency that it would be “technically infeasible” to display the data to consumers. Another from Frontier Airlines, which advertises lower-cost fares subsidized in part by extra fees, described regulation as a “solution searching for a problem,” noting there are “scarce IT development resource[s]” to do as the government proposes. (Frontier declined to comment.) Asked about the industry resistance, the agency could not comment on specific claims since it has not finalized its rules, which are expected next year. But Jen Howard, the top competition official at the Department of Transportation, stressed it is “important consumers know what they’re getting into upfront.” “Companies are making billions off of junk fees,” she added.","November 19, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
221,Washington Post,Antisemitism was rising online. Then Elon Musk’s X supercharged it.,Elizabeth Dwoskin and Taylor Lorenz and Naomi Nix and Joseph Menn and Elizabeth Dwoskin and Taylor Lorenz and Naomi Nix and Joseph Menn,"In the weeks following the Oct. 7Hamasattack on Israel, Twitter user @breakingbaht criticized leftists, academics and “minorities” for defending the militant group. But it wasn’t until the user spoke up on behalf of antisemites that he struck a viral chord with X owner Elon Musk. The user blamed Jewish communities for bringing antisemitism upon themselves by supporting immigration to the United States, welcoming “hordes of minorities” who don’t like Jews and promoting “hatred against whites.” “You have said the actual truth,” Musk responded. Soon, @breakingbaht had gained several thousand new followers — and the antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews are causing the replacement of White people was ricocheting across the internet once again. Antisemitism has long festered online, but the Israel-Gaza warand the loosening of content moderation on X have propelled it to unprecedented levels, coinciding with a dramatic rise in real-world attacks on Jews, according to several monitoring organizations. Since Oct. 7, antisemitic content has surged more than 900 percent on X and there have been more than 1,000incidents of real-world antisemitic attacks, vandalism and harassment in America, according to the Anti-Defamation League — the highest number since the human rights group started counting. (That includes about 200 rallies the group deemed to be at least implicitly supporting Hamas.) Factors that predate the Gaza war laid the groundwork for the heightened antisemitic atmosphere, say experts and advocates: the feeling of empowerment some neo-Nazis felt during the Trump presidency, the decline of enforcement on tech platformsin the face of layoffs and Republican criticism, even the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021, which gave rise to harsh criticism of Israel’s actions and sustained antisemitism online. But Musk plays a uniquely potent role in the drama, disinformation specialists say. His comments amplifying antisemitic tropes to his 163.5 million followers, his dramatic loosening of standards for what can be posted, and his boosting of voices that previously had been banned from the platform formerly known as Twitter all have made antisemitism more acceptable on what is still one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. Bin Laden’s ‘Letter to America’ went viral after a journalist posted Tik Tok videos to X Musk’s endorsement of comments alluding to the great replacement theory — a conspiracy theory espoused by neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville in 2017 and the gunmen who killed people inside synagogues in Pittsburgh in 2018 and Poway, Calif., in 2019 — broughtcondemnation from the White Houseandadvertising cancellations from IBM,Apple, Comcast, and Disney, among others. Late Friday, Musk was unrepentant: “Many of the largest advertisers are the greatest oppressors of your right to free speech,” he tweeted after word of the cancellations spread. He did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Joan Donovan, a former research director at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center who now teaches at Boston University, included Musk in what she described as “a strata of influencers … who feel very comfortable condemning Jewish people as a political critique.” “In moments where there is a lot of concern, these right-wing influencers do go mask-off and say what they really feel,” she said. The Israel-Gaza war also has given new life to prominent Holocaust deniers who have proclaimed on X, Telegram and other platforms that the Hamas attacks that left hundreds of Israelis dead were “false flags.” The #Hitlerwasright hashtag, which surged during the 2021 war, has returned, with Memetica, a digital investigations firm, tallying 46,000 uses of the phrase on X since Oct. 7. Previously, the hashtag appeared fewer than 5,000 times per month. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit focused on online extremism and disinformation, identified 200 posts that promoted antisemitism and other forms of hate speech amid the conflict. X allowed 196 of them to remain on the platform, the group said in a report. Seventy-six of those posts amassed a collective 141 million views in 24 hours after an explosion at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on Oct. 17. The majority of the posts appeared on X Premium accounts, a subscription service that grants a blue “verified” check mark to anyone willing to pay a monthly fee. Previously, such status was available only to public figures, journalists and elected officials. “Elon Musk has shaped X into a social media universe that revolves around his beliefs and whims while still shaping politics and culture around the world. And he’s using it to spread the most disgusting lies that humans ever invented,” said Emerson Brooking, resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank and co-author of the 2018 book “Like War: The Weaponization of Social Media.” Hatred against Jews has long been a feature of the internet. Extremists were early adopters of social media platforms, using them to find like-minded people to share views that would be distasteful in other settings, Brooking said. In the mid-2000s, lies spread by anonymous users onplatforms such as 4chan and Usenet blamed Jews for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and for the 2008 financial crisis. But the most extreme antisemitism, such as Holocaust denial, remained largely confined to the fringe, said Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the ADL. Well-known Holocaust deniers had little access to mainstream news media. By the 2010s, however, an internet subculture that repackaged antisemitism into something seemingly more palatable started to take shape — often on newer andless moderated platforms like Discord, 8chan, and Telegram, and also on mainstream services like Facebook and You Tube. Instead of swastikas, the currency became jokes, memes like Pepe the Frog, and terms for white supremacy like “alt-right.” The election of former president Donald Trumpgalvanized this group; Richard B. Spencer, then president of the white-supremacist National Policy Institute, made headlines by telling a meeting of supporters after Trump’s election victory, “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” “Suddenly, racists and antisemites who had lived at the margins of society found that they had new legitimacy. And a rising generation of far-right Americans saw that it was okay to say and do hateful things, because the president was doing them already,” Brooking said. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville,organized on Facebook and the gaming platform Discord, became the first time a broad group of Americans, watching on television and online, heard the slogan “Jews will not replace us,” chanted by a torch-carrying crowd seeking to prevent the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. “We saw an inflection point where online expression had turned into bigger real-world organizing,” the ADL’s Segal said of the demonstration. Trump did little to tamp down these ideas and often amplified them, occasionally retweeting antisemitic memes andfamously saying“there were very fine people on both sides” of the Charlottesville rally, at which a neo-Nazi sympathizer drove his car into counterprotesters, killing a woman. In an emailed statement, the Trump campaign denounced any effort to link the former president to antisemitism. “The real racists and antisemites are deranged Democrats and liberals who are marching in support of terrorist groups like Hamas and calling for the death of Israel,” the statement said. “There has been no bigger champion for Israel than President Trump, as evidenced by moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, signing laws that curb anti-Semitism, and much more.” The statement added, “For a media organization like The Washington Post to make such a ridiculous charge proves it has its own racism and anti-Semitism issues they must address before casting stones.” The Trump years also saw the rise of mass shooters steeped in antisemitic fabrications. In New Zealand, El Paso, Buffalo, and at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, shooters cited the great replacement theory as their inspiration, and in some casesposted manifestos about it. Amid the growing violence, tech platforms that had taken a tolerant approach to antisemitic posts cracked down. You Tube banned Holocaust denial in 2019 and Metadid soin 2020, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg haddefendednot prohibiting such contentjust twoyears earlier. Both companiesexpanded their hate speech policiesto includewhite-supremacist contentin 2019. Those actions sent antisemitism back to the fringes, and to newer services, such as Gab, that specifically catered to right-wing audiences. “What I can tell you is major accounts that were spreading antisemitism …were falling like dominoes,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “They were quickly re-platforming themselves in places like Gab. But there they were more preaching to the choir as opposed to being able to radicalize random people.” Then in 2022, Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter closed. Musk had been saying for months that one of the reasons he wanted to buy Twitter was to embrace “free speech” and relax the platform’s content moderation practices. Hours after he took over, anonymous trollsflooded the sitewith racist slurs. The rise in bigotry on the platform prompted civil rights groups to pressure advertisers — sometimes successfully — to pause spending on Twitter. Last November, Muskextended an olive branchto those activists, pledging in a private meeting not to reinstate banned accounts until there was a process to do that. That concession angered far-right influencers on the site, who accused him of being a traitor to their cause. Later that month, Muskreinstated thousands of accounts— including Trump’s— that had been banned for threats, harassment and misinformation. Since then, hateful rhetoric on the platform has increased, researchers said. Musk invited back banned Hitler apologists, sent out his own antisemitic tweets to his followers, and promoted the work of Great Replacement backers including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Those actions demolished the previous bounds of acceptable speech, inviting more people to weigh in with wild theories and emotions about religious and ethnic minorities. On Wednesday, Gab’s official X account shared a meme celebrating that Musk had affirmed “Jews are the ones pushing anti-White hatred” along with the caption, “We are so back.” (The Xpost, which has since been deleted, was liked 19,000 times and viewed 720,000 times.) On Friday, several major companies announced that they were pulling advertising from X, including Apple, Lionsgate Entertainment and Comcast, parent of NBCUniversal. In the first quarter of 2022, Applewas Twitter’s top advertiser,accounting for nearly $50 million in revenue. Media Matters, a nonprofit media watchdog,published a reportshowing that X has been placing ads for Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, Amazon and more next to pro-Nazi content. On Saturday, Musk threatened to sue Media Matters, accusing it of misrepresenting “the real experience on X.” Some news publishers also have pulled out of the platform. NPRshut down its X account in April after Musk falsely labeled the nonprofit broadcaster “state controlled media.” On Thursday, the journalist Casey Newton announced that he would be pulling Platformer, the independent tech news outlet he founded, from X and would no longer include posts on X in the Platformer newsletter. “It’s the only way I know how to send the message that no one should be there, that this is not a place where you should be going to get news or to discuss news or to have a good time,” he told The Post. “It is just over. If you wouldn’t join Gab, or Parler, or Truth Social, there’s no reason you should be on X. I think it’s time for journalists and publishers, in particular, to acknowledge the new reality and to get the heck off that website.” Newton said that media companies, including The Post, that continue to pay to advertise on the site are funding Musk’s hate campaigns. “Publishers have to look themselves in the mirror and ask, why did they get into this business in the first place?” he said. “Didn’t it have something to do with speaking out against oppression and bigotry and standing up in the face of oppression?” A Post spokesperson declined to comment. Hateful rhetoric that appears on X ripples out to the whole internet, normalizing an unprecedented level of antisemitic hate, experts said. “Twitter is the most influential platform in shifting sentiments,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “[It] has always had an outsize influence in determining what takes start to be perceived as the vox populi.” Musk has sued the CCDH for defamation over its reports on X. The international reach of big social platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok also has served to highlight tensions.Tik Tok has come under firefor videos critical of Israel or supportive of Palestinians that carry the#freepalestinehashtag; Tik Tok data show that many of those arise from predominantly Muslim countries, such as Malaysia and Lebanon, where support for Palestinians has long been high. Dozens of high profile Jewish content creatorsissued an open letter to Tik Tokearlier this month, saying that the platform hadn’t done enough to counter hatred and abuse toward the Jewish community on the app. On Wednesday, many of those creators, along with prominent celebrities including Amy Schumer, Debra Messing and Sacha Baron Cohen, met with representatives from the company to voice their concerns. The conversation was heated and intense, according to creators who attended. “We recognize this is an incredibly difficult and fearful time for millions of people around the world and in our Tik Tok community,” Tik Tok said in a statement. “Our leadership has been meeting with creators, civil society, human rights experts and stakeholders to listen to their experiences and feedback on how Tik Tok can remain a place for community, discovery, and sharing authentically.” Since Oct. 7, Tik Tok has removed more than 730,000 videos for hate speech, including content promoting antisemitism, the company said. Content creator Montana Tucker, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who has more than 9 million followers on Tik Tok and 3 million on Instagram, attended the meeting with Tik Tok. She said she’s noticed a sharp uptick in antisemitism across all platforms, and plans to stay on X for now. “It’s happening on every single app, unfortunately,” she said. “All of these people, I’m sure they would love for us to hide and to not post and to not share … but we need to be more vocal. We need to be on these apps and we need to continue to share. I think it’s more of a reason I need to start posting more on [X].” Outside of social media, white supremacists and neo-Nazis have continued to use lightly moderated messaging platforms such as Telegram and group-run websites to distribute hate messages and propaganda since the Israel-Gaza war began, according to the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit that tracks the groups. The Global Project Against Hate and Extremismfoundthat antisemitic and anti-Muslim posts on 4chan, Gab, Odysee, and Bitchute increased 461 percent from 618 to 3,466 from Oct. 6 to Oct. 8. A researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London think tank thattracks hate and disinformation, said online extremists were having a “field day,” with far-right groups using Hamas propaganda to bolster antisemitic messages. Russia’s sophisticated disinformation apparatus also has seized on the conflict. One of Russia’s widest ongoing campaigns, known as Doppelgänger,promotes fake articles on clones of major media websites. Links to the pages are sent out rapidly by large networks of automated accounts on X and Facebook. For the past year, most of these articles have been aimed at undermining Western support for Ukraine, Russia’s top priority. But not long after Oct. 7, some Doppelgänger assets started promoting the idea that the United States cared far more about Israel and would stop sending Ukraine as much aid, according to Antibot4Navalny, a group of volunteers who track Russian disinformation on the internet. More recently, the social media accounts amplified pictures of the Jewish Star of David spray-painted on buildings in Paris, according to the nonprofit E.U. Disinfo Lab. That advanced multiple objectives, the organization said: It generated additional concern about possible increases in antisemitism in France. It likely encouraged antisemites to think they are greater in number. And above all, it focused  attention on Israel, rather than Ukraine and Russia. Benjamin Decker, founder of Memetica, said that a major portion of 4chan links to outside coverage of Israel and Hamas go to articles from media sourcesin Iran, China or Russia. “You can’t attribute it to these actors yet, but from the beginning there have been cross-platform communities with a vested interest in stoking hate,” he said. “There is a highly digital far-right community who loves celebrating the deaths of Jews, and that dovetails with Hamas.” “We’re in a really dangerous place,” the CCDH’s Ahmed said. “There’s no clearer link between disinformation, conspiracy theories, and real world hate than there is with antisemitism.” Will Oremus and Drew Harwell contributed reporting.","November 19, 2023 at 12:00 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
222,Washington Post,Biden campaign works to ease Democratic anxiety over reelection chances,Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager and Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker and Tyler Pager and Michael Scherer,"Over the last full weekend of September, Hollywood titan Ari Emanuel — brother of former Chicago mayor and current Japan Ambassador Rahm Emanuel — co-hosted his annual, off-the-record power conference, gathering fellow luminaries of entertainment, finance, politics and technology in sun-dappled Aspen, Colo. At one point, during a political panel that included Ron Klain, President Biden’s former chief of staff, an audience member worried aloud that the Democratic Party had a serious problem. Biden is too old and could lose the election, this person fretted, before asking the question that has been disquieting Democratic circles for more than a year: What is the backup plan? Klain’s rebuttal was swift, recalled one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid details of the private event. The president is the party’s nominee, Klain said, and a strong nominee at that. There is no backup plan. The audience rumbled with exasperation and disbelief, grumbling about the lack of a Plan B. But some Democrats later approached Klain to thank him for his forceful defense of Biden, a second person familiar with the moment said. Similar scenes have been playing out repeatedly since then, as Biden’s allies play whack-a-mole with the burbling anxiety — reflected in early polling — that Biden could lose in an increasingly likely 2024 rematch next year between two veterans of the Oval Office, Biden and Donald Trump. Facing calls to become more active and aggressive, Biden and his team have responded with versions of Klain’s defiance. They have rejected the concerns in private briefings with donors and allies and have otherwise stayed the course on the mostly behind-the-scenes work of testing ads, organizing and outreach efforts that they will deploy at scale next year. This portrait of Democratic anxiety — and the Biden campaign’s effort to contain the party’s crisis of confidence — is the result of 30 interviews with Democratic aides, strategists, Biden campaign officials and others, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid assessments on a sensitive topic. The central concern is that Biden, who turns 81 on Monday, has lost a step and is showing visible signs of aging. He has struggled to sell his economic accomplishments. And there are worries that his campaign, so far devoid of major events or organizing efforts, is not doing enough to deal with the public hand-wringing over his chances or the coming threat of Trump, 77. The unease is evident across the party: administration officials, elected officials, major donors — including those who have already given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Biden and his team — top strategists and campaign officials closely allied or working with the reelection effort. The White House and the Biden campaign have largely dismissed the concerns as unjustified agita, reminiscent of the criticism Biden’s campaign faced in 2020 and former president Barack Obama’s reelection campaign underwent in the fall of 2011. They argue that the current polling does not capture the likely outcome of an election, which will only come into focus once voters engage next year with the possibility of another Trump term in the White House. The debate has arrived amid a growing realization, less than a year out from the 2024 presidential election, that there may not be any other viable option for the Democratic nomination. Biden enjoys a nearly 60-point lead over his two major primary opponents, author Marianne Williamsonand Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), and the logistics to even mount a viable primary opposition at this late date are daunting. The last time an incumbent president declined to seek reelection was more than a half-century ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson — amid the growing unpopularity of the Vietnam War — stunned the nation in 1968 by announcing he would not run for a second term. Even privately, Biden has showed no signs of stepping aside — and doing so now could unleash seismic consequences, making Democrats look divided at a time when unity is paramount. “Joe Biden is not a perfect person — no such person exists — and he has strengths and weaknesses as a candidate, to be sure, but he will be the Democratic Party’s nominee,” said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic strategist and major fundraiser. “Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, and he is the best bet to beat Donald Trump, and people have to help us make that happen because the alternative is Donald Trump and is a catastrophe for American democracy.” Some of Biden’s biggest donors, who have already given hundreds of thousands of dollars to his effort, have privately expressed a desire for a more open primary. Others fear Biden risks endangering both his legislative legacy and his status as the Trump slayer if he loses next year, people familiar with the conversations said. The concerns are anchored in early survey data, which show Biden is weaker than he was four years ago. An October Fox News poll found 53 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see the party nominate someone other than Biden. A 59 percent majority said they have an unfavorable view of Biden overall, up from 44 percent in the fall of 2019 and similar to the 56 percent who currently see Trump in an unfavorable light. The unexpected Israel-Gaza warhas magnified fissures in the Democratic Party domestically, and Biden is also grappling with other challenges, from the ongoing debate of how to handle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to inflation. Democrats close to the campaign are alsogrowing increasingly alarmed about its strategy — or, more specifically, what they worry is the lack of one, according to conversations with multiple people briefed on the operation. Some argue that neither Biden nor his team have effectively communicated a reelection plan, a second-term governing vision or a clear argument against Trump. In response, the Biden camp’s public message has begun to shift in recent days, withfar more aggressive attacks on Trump’s recordon opposingabortionrights and on his second-term plans for immigration, including a massive expansion of deportations and a legal challenge to birthright citizenship. “How many times in 2020 did you hear the president say, ‘Don’t compare me to the almighty — compare me to the alternative,’” former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said. “Well, if I were them, I’d say, ‘Let the comparison begin,’ and push it on the contrast in values and policies and results that work for them.” Others have expressed concern at the campaign’s polling strategy, which they say has been too limited as staff focus on measuring the effectiveness and reach of the campaign’s early advertising. Democrats briefed on the campaign operation said there are unanswered questions that could help guide a strategy — including how to effectively communicate about Biden’s weaknesses, such as his age and the economy. Biden advisers counters that more polling is being done than their critics know about. “The absence of polling explains stuff like ‘Bidenomics,’” said one national Democratic consultant, referring to Biden’s slogan for selling his economic policies at a time when voters remain deeply unhappy with his efforts in that area. “It’s just malpractice.” Democrats have also expressed concern about the campaign’s thin operation in battleground states. Outside ofpilot programs for organizing in Arizona and Wisconsin, the campaign has not built on the Democratic National Committee’s presence in key states or placed staff in any of the early primary states. That is expected to shift in the coming weeks, as the campaign moves to appoint state directors for the early primary state of South Carolina and at least two other states by the end of the year. Ultimately, though, many worried donors say they have no plans to take their concerns public or change course. Some are enticed by Phillips, who is the lone elected Democrat challenging Biden, but view his bid as a long-shot protest campaign rather than a true alternative. Others remain confident in the senior team around Biden, most of whom continue to work in the White House and have weathered many similar waves of public grousing in previous campaigns. “The bad news is that everybody is wetting the bed inside of Biden world,” said one fundraiser. “It’s really an unhappy confluence of Biden world donors’ cocktail party friends saying ‘Can’t you get him not to run,’ which is stupid and absurd if you know Joe Biden.” Inside the White House, the donor freakout has largely prompted eye rolls from senior staff. In private conversations, top aides to the president have not second guessed their strategy and have brushed off the criticism as another round of Democrats underestimating Biden. But others helping the campaign privately acknowledge the need to more directly head off the impression — particularly among donors — that the campaign lacks a clear strategy or the ability to execute it, prompting new outreach to stakeholders. Other Biden allies also stress that Democratic panic is not universal. At donor meetings in Washington recently for Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, officials said there was no second guessing Biden. “No one asked if he’s going to run,” said Amanda Loveday, a senior adviser to Unite the Country. “No one asked, ‘Can he do it?’ No one asked, ‘Can he win?’ It was 100 percent behind the guy. He’s the only option to beat Trump, and having Trump is not an option.” Just six weeks after the confab in Aspen, Biden campaign officials — including senior adviser Becca Siegel and chief analytics officer Meg Schwenzfeier — delivered a presentation in Chicago, timed to coincide with the Obama Foundation democracy forum there, to address the same alarm. Several thousand former Obama staffers were gathering in Chicago on the first weekend of November for the event pegged to the 15th anniversary of his 2008 victory, and Biden allies realized the president had a serious problem: Many Democrats were increasingly unhappy over Biden being their standard-bearer, and the campaign needed to reassure the party faithful of his path to victory. The pitch was effective in calming nerves, according to several people familiar with the presentation, as it ran through the broader electoral trends in six key swing states, which have all moved toward Democrats since 2022. The campaign aides also ran through the reasons they believe that current polling cannot predict an outcome next year — because so many voters are currently tuned out and do not yet view the race as a stark choice between Trump and Biden. At the end of the presentation, they emphasized how close they expect the 2024 election to be, noting that if 45,000 people had voted differently in key states in 2020, Trump would still be president. That same weekend, the New York Times and Siena College released a set ofpolls showing Biden trailing Trumpin five of six key battleground states, amid voter concerns about Biden’s age and his handling of the economy. Axelrod, a key architect of Obama’s presidential campaigns, took to X, previously Twitter, to worry aloud about his party’s likely nominee. In hisposts, Axelrod described the polls as a “legitimate concern”; noted that Biden’s age is “his biggest liability” and “the one thing he can’t change”; and concluded by asking “whether it’s in HIS best interest or the country’s” for Biden to continue to run for reelection. “The real Plan B should be that the whole party should be thrust into a comparative process,” he said in an interview a few days after his posts on X. “We’re at a kind of inflection point. It’s good to take stock of where this is at. It’s good to have these discussions.” At the Chicago forum, multiple attendees also noted the pointed absence of any meaningful cheerleading for Biden, who had served eight years as Obama’s vice president. Obama barely mentioned Biden in the speech he delivered that Friday night, and in an interview with the Pod Save America podcast the same day, Obama eschewed several opportunities to promote his former running mate’s campaign. An Obama spokesperson said the reunion was hosted by the Obama Foundation, a nonprofit that cannot legally engage in partisan political activity, and pointed to the Biden campaign’s off-site briefing, which drew a standing-room-only crowd. Yet several attendees said the tensions were evident. “The takeaway of the weekend was not, ‘Hey team, we’re got to get the band back together to help Biden out,’” said one, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment. “If this is a supposedly existential threat and democracy is so challenged, then why aren’t you being more overt about it.” Even inside the Biden operation, there is a growing recognition they need to prove to voters they are working hard to win the election. “We’re going to have to earn our reelect, there’s no doubt about it,” Vice President Harris told CNN in an interview Sunday. The following Tuesday, Democrats made impressive gains in another off-year election — helping to quiet some of the Biden Plan B chatter, at least temporarily. Democrats held the governorship in reliably Republican Kentucky, and seized control of the Virginia legislature, despite high profile efforts by Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) to boost Republican numbers. In Ohio, Democrats also lifted ballot initiatives supporting abortion rights and marijuana legalization. “We have heard the press and pundits count Joe Biden out time and time again, but we know that he always proves them wrong,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said afterward. “If we want a real window into where voters actually are, we know the best way to measure that is to see how they are actually voting.” Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist who worked in both the Biden and Obama administrations, said the election “relegates an internecine party squabble to a blip, and makes it clear that polls don’t vote — people do.” Phillips, however, said Biden and his team are taking the wrong message away from the recent elections. He has vowed to fight on for the nomination, starting in New Hampshire, where the primary is unsanctioned by the Democratic Party and Biden supporters must write in the president’s name to vote for him. “The Democratic brand isn’t the problem,” Phillips said in an interview. “It’s becoming clear that President Biden is the problem.” There is another problem for Democrats looking for a Biden alternative: the reality that, less than a year from Election Day, there is no feasible backup option. Multiple Democrats privately say they believe Harris would prove similarly weak — if not weaker — than Biden as a general election candidate, and other would-be Democratic candidates are also losing to Trump in current head-to-head polls.But, they add, even if Biden were to stand down, they see no way of also pushing aside his No. 2 — a historic first Black, Indian American and female vice president — without alienating huge swaths of the Democratic base. Meanwhile, the electoral calendar and its filing deadlines prove yet another hurdle, making it challenging for any would-be candidate to get on the ballot in all 50 states. The deadlines to qualify for the presidential primaryballot in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Nevada and South Carolina have already passed, meaning any late entrant will have already lost the opportunity to win delegates in those states. The difficulty of meeting each state’s requirements varies and the hurdles often involve complex signature-gathering efforts that take time, resources and a well-trained staff. “It’s a very practical problem that people are beginning to face right now,” said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, as she ticked off more than a dozen ballot deadlines coming up in late November and early January. And even if the next generation of Democrats could scramble to mount a plausible bid, there are no guarantees such an effort would be seamless — or victorious. “A lot of people come and they wish-cast, like imagine Gretchen Whitmer and imagine Raphael Warnock going up on the same ticket,” Mehlhorn said, referring to the Democratic governor of Michigan and the Democratic junior senator from Georgia, respectively. “And it’s like, yeah, I could spin that, I watched ‘The West Wing,’ but there are a lot of steps to get there.” Scott Clement, Amy Gardner and Maeve Reston contributed to this report.

223,Washington Post,"Carolyn Hax: Scoff at third weddings, and you might find yourself uninvited",Carolyn Hax and Carolyn Hax,"Dear Carolyn:My brother, “Tim,” got married for the third time last month. When he and “Abby” were discussing their wedding, I advised them to do what my husband and I did: Go to the courthouse and then throw a party to celebrate. My husband even joked that he’d already been Tim’s best man twice and that was enough. And even though Abby was a first-time bride, she’s 45 and past the pretty-pretty-princess stage. Later they announced that Abby’s uncle, who’s a judge, would be marrying them when they visited Abby’s family, and Abby’s sister was throwing a small party for them. Our family could celebrate at Thanksgiving. That sounded like a great plan. This week, we saw pictures of the wedding and it was a much bigger deal than Tim had let on. There were at least 30 or 40 guests, all from Abby’s side, I guess; Abby wore a wedding dress; there was a big cake and dozens of roses; yet no one from our side of the family was invited. I’m really hurt we were excluded, I guess as punishment for speaking our minds. Tim and Abby could have admitted they wanted to do the wedding their way instead of sneaking around behind our backs. Can I ask Tim why he hid their wedding from us, or do I just need to let this go? — Anonymous Anonymous:You weren’t “speaking our minds.” You were, by your own description, talking more than you listened, ridiculing your brother in front of his fiancée, diminishing her by extension, and making judgy, sexist and ageist assumptions about what constitutes an appropriate amount of wedding fuss for a middle-aged bride — and all this when the number and type of weddings either of them has is neither your business nor of significant consequence to you. I’m not sure if the smugness was worse or the buzzkill, but the proportions of both might make the cut for “epic.” So, no, you do not ask Tim to spell out what you already know. Instead, you congratulate Tim and Abby for what looks to have been a beautiful wedding, and apologize for getting so caught up in having opinions at their expense that you forgot your only job was to shut up and be happy for them. And buy them a serious gift. One that’s princess as [all get-out]. Dear Carolyn:I started a gift tradition that now causes everyone stress, and I don’t know what to do. When my kids were little and the only grandchildren, I started making a calendar for my mother-in-law. As the extended family grew, I would ask for pics to include all the grandchildren. “C” and her husband would require multiple reminders, and finally submit pictures late or in the wrong format to make more work for me. Finally, I had had enough and asked “E” to take it on. He is only willing to engage so far with what we all see as crazy behavior by C. One year, I asked her to just send the damn pictures to him. She blew up at me and said just do the calendar without her family. E is now asking for someone else to take a turn with the calendar “because I need a break.” If the calendar doesn’t get done, then my mother-in-law is sad that we “can’t all get along.” The constant refrain is, “Just don’t make C mad.” We take a family vacation every summer, and, without fail, someone does something that makes her mad and she has a blowup. Every. Year. Any ideas how to deal with this Christmas present? — About to Blow Up Enjoying Carolyn Hax’s advice? There’s more where that came from. Sign up for her newsletter so you don’t miss a column.

Because the specifics don’t matter: What does matter is that you stop treating anyone’s difficult personality as a ransom demand you must pay to get your life back. C is who C is. If you behave in ways you believe are thoughtful and fair — whatever the behavior, not just calendars — then you will have the raw material for enough confidence to ride out any resulting emotional punishment.

224,Washington Post,A rift over ‘profound autism’ reveals a community’s deeper divide,,"Public perceptions of autism have come far in the 80 years since Austrian American scientist Leo Kanner first described aneurodevelopmentalchildhood disorder causing “an innate inability to form the usual, biologically provided contact with people.” Against a backdrop of a burgeoningneurodiversitymovement portraying wide variations in human behavior asdifferences, not deficits, many autistic adults have come to see their traits as agiftand source ofpride. Yet parents such as Maria Leary, the mother of two autistic, nonverbal sons — one of whom frequently injured himself and others before his death in 2018 — fear the neurodiversity revolution is leaving her family behind. “You see happy videos of the great accomplishments of people with autism who get to go to work and play in basketball games,” says Leary, who is also a New Jersey disability consultant. “And, of course, that’s what I want for my kids. But that’s not my reality.” Leary is on one side of a debate that probably will heat up in coming months as advocates seek different outcomes from Congress’s review of the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (Autism Cares) Act of 2019. At the heart of the divide is a deceptively simple phrase: “profound autism.” Parents such as Leary believe recognizing some people as having profound autism would help target more research and support for children like theirs who are nonverbal, intellectually disabled and in need of constant supervision. In a paper in the journal Public Health Reports this year,researchers estimatedthat nearly 27 percent of 20,000 autistic 8-year-olds whose records they analyzed could be categorized as having profound autism. Leaders of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), however, reject the phrase, calling it dangerous and misleading. “We are concerned about the human and legal rights of the people who would be so labeled,” ASAN Executive Director Julia Bascom said in an email. Devoting funds to “profound autism,” she wrote, “would result in research aiming to ‘prevent’ or ‘cure’ autism, and a focus on more restrictive services.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that1 in 36 U.S. children(roughly 2 million) and some5.4 million adultshave autism spectrum disorder. While the causes aren’t well understood, some scientists believe itruns in families.No link has been found between autism and vaccines. Until 2013, clinicians diagnosed people with any one of four distinct categories of autism, including Asperger’s syndrome, calledhigh-functioning autism by some, andchildhood disintegrative disorder, a rarer and more debilitating condition. But following a major revision that year in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a key clinical guidebook, these separate diagnoses were consolidated as “autism spectrum disorder.” ‘Nothing about us without us’ Horrific history predates ASAN’s perspective. Less than 100 years ago, the American Journal of Psychiatry published a debate on the merits of using “euthanasia” for “feebleminded people.” In the 1980s, autistic Americans were still being shut away in overcrowded, unsanitary and abusive institutions such as Willowbrook State Schoolon Staten Island. In 1993, the autistic self-advocate Jim Sinclair’s landmark essay, “Don’t Mourn for Us,” advised parents of autistic children who “pray for a cure” to let go of their “grief over the loss of a fantasized normal child.” Sinclair helped pioneer neurodiversity activism, including the demand that people with autism have input into decisions about scientific research and policy. ASAN’s motto is “nothing about us without us.” The civil rights battle has brought progress in understanding, although at some cost. Some scientists havedeclined opportunities to speakabout autism for fear of being heckled for using terms such as“risk,” “problem behavior” and “symptoms,”which some advocates call offensive. Parents speaking about their struggles have been branded “mommy martyrs.” Singer showed The Washington Post several threatening texts she says she received. At the same time, ASAN’s Bascom says her organization has received bomb threats and won’t print its physical address because of security concerns. Share this article Share Parents including Leary and Singer insist that, while they respect the achievements of autistic adults able to advocate for themselves, they need to speak on behalf of children unable to do so. Leary’s firstborn son, David, who was born with autism and a rare genetic condition, suffered epileptic seizures, couldn’t speak and often banged his head on the floor. He was treated for behavioral problems at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore before his death at age 12, which was believed to be due to a seizure. “I’d felt like I was failing because other kids I knew were getting better and he was getting worse,” his mother says. “Then I saw 15 other kids in his unit just like him, and I realized this is something other people don’t even know about. … we need services to cover these children as well as others.” Julie Greenan, a nurse from Buffalo, met Leary a decade ago at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, where Greenan’s son Sam, then 11, was also being treated for behavioral issues, including kicking, scratching and biting himself and others. Greenan has an unusual perspective, in that all five of her children have been diagnosed with autism, yet they have a range of abilities and needs. Now 21, Sam is living in a group home while her oldest, at 24, is a college graduate with a job in his chosen field of musical theater. Greenan blames the 2013 change in diagnostic rules for the discord in the autism community. “Before that, we didn’t have to fight each other about who gets services,” she says. “Saying there can’t be different levels of autism is like saying … other people’s experiences don’t matter.” Many parents of children like Greenan’s son Sam, whom she says can be violent or self-injurious and needs 24/7 supervision, say they desperately need more specialized services including long-term housing options. ASAN insists that autistic people should be able to live“in the same places as non-disabled people,”instead of restrictive institutions, yet other observers say the small-scale, community-based formula is failing because of a lack of resources and staff. Some 656,000 Americans,most with intellectual and developmental disabilities, were on wait lists for state-paid home and community-based services in 2021, according to KFF, and emergency department visits andlong hospital staysby people with severe autism skyrocketed between 2009 and 2014, as Kaiser Health News has reported. “A lot of people with profound autism in acute psychiatric and behavioral crises wouldn’t be in that position if there were sufficient high-quality, dignified, well-staffed and well-run residential facilities and congregate living options across the United States,” says Lee Wachtel, medical director of the Neurobehavioral Unit at Kennedy Krieger Institute. She said the institute has a wait list 150 names long for its inpatient treatment program. Parsing ‘profound autism’ The term “profound autism” was proposed in 2021 by the Lancet Commission on the future of care and clinical research in autism, which specified traits including a substantial intellectual disability (such as an IQ below 50) and very limited language (“e.g., limited ability to communicate to a stranger using comprehensible sentences”). “It came from a concern that there are a lot of people who need help and are getting lost in the shuffle,” says Catherine Lord, the report’s lead author and a psychiatry professor at UCLA School of Medicine. Ten years after autism was presented as a spectrum, reestablishing a category for more severely impaired people might help earmark resources for people unable to care for themselves, Lord adds. Yet she concedes that the backlash following her report surprised her. Steve Silberman, author of “Neuro Tribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity,” summed up the objections in an interview. “'Profound autism’ may seem like useful shorthand for parents struggling with their children’s behavior, but it raises more questions than it answers,” he says. “These debates are unfolding as if a child who receives the ‘profound autism’ label might not be deemed as having ‘mild autism’ after receiving better support and accommodations.” A case in point is the celebrated animal behavior expert Temple Grandin, who didn’t speak until she was 3½ years old. Instead, shescreamed, hummed and threw tantrums.Much later, she explained that she had acted out because her petticoatsitched and scratched. Grandin’swebsitenow says: “I like the logical way that I think and I do not want to be cured.” ‘Tearing each other apart’ Bascom characterizes the controversies as the result of a power shift. “For many, many years, autism advocacy was dominated by nonautistic voices, and they could say whatever they wanted about autistic people without any pushback,” she wrote. “Now, autistic people have pushed ourselves into many of these conversations and are talking back. People in power often experience that sort of dynamic as uncivil.” Others worry about potential fallout from the charged conversation. A “toxic competition” may discourage members of Congress considering the Autism Cares Act, says Craig Snyder, a lobbyist for Singer’s foundation and supporters.

225,Washington Post,Fossils of an ancient deluge show how high sea levels could rise,Sarah Kaplan and Bonnie Jo Mount and Simon Ducroquet and Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones and Sarah Kaplan and Bonnie Jo Mount and Simon Ducroquet and Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones and Sarah Kaplan and Bonnie Jo Mount and Simon Ducroquet and Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones and Sarah Kaplan and Bonnie Jo Mount and Simon Ducroquet and Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones,"Scroll to continue This is a fossilized coral â one of dozens scattered across the Indian Ocean archipelago of the Seychelles. It is a piece of history, hidden in plain sight. It tells of a time 125,000 years ago, when a modest increase in Earthâs temperatures caused ice sheets to melt and global sea levels to surge. The height of the coral â which can grow only underwater â marks where the ocean once reached, and where it could someday rise again. Sarah Kaplan and Bonnie Jo Mount traveled to four islands of the Seychelles and a geochemistry lab in Madison, Wisc. to document how fossil corals are helping scientists predict future sea level rise. Ashuman-caused climate changeremakes the worldâs coastlines, these fossil relics from Earthâs past are helping scientists understand how futuresea level risecould unfold. By studying the long-dead coral reefs, researchers have revealed not only how high sea levels can reach, but where the deluge will hit hardest. As temperatures surge andice sheetsmelt, the fossils show, the oceans wonât rise evenly around the planet. Instead, theloss of polar icewill trigger profound changes in Earthâs gravity and shape â which, in turn, will create dramatic disparities in where ocean water flows. But the most worrying lesson from this research may lie in the differences between the time of the corals and today. Researchers warn that the warming brought about by human-generated greenhouse gas emissions is unlike anything that has previously happened in the Earthâs history. That means modern sea level rise may not exactly mirror what happened last time â it might be worse. In all the world, there are no islands like the Seychelles. Most oceanic islandsare volcanic,formed by magma that wells up as tectonic plates drift over hot spots in the Earthâs mantle. Others are coral atolls â low-lying, ring-shaped landforms created when sea level drops below the surface of a reef. But the Seychelles are fragments of an ancient continent dropped in the middle of the sea. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the granite peaks that make up much of the archipelago â including the main inhabited islands of MahÃ©, Praslin and La Digue â were sandwiched between India and Madagascar in a giant landmass known as Gondwana. When the supercontinent broke apart, and India drifted northeast to its current position, the Seychelles were scattered behind like breadcrumbs. Isolated by the wide blue expanse of the Indian Ocean, the Seychelles became a haven for plants and animals found nowhere else: 500-pound tortoises, opulent rare birds,a palm treethat produces the heaviest seeds on Earth. When early European colonists first encountered the islands, the shimmering coastlines and lushly forested mountains reminded them of the biblical Garden of Eden. Today,some 300,000 foreign touristsâ three times the Seychellesâ population â flock to the countryâs beaches every year. To Andrea Dutton, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the Seychellesâ geologic singularity made it the perfect place to conductresearch on ancient sea levels. The granite landmasses do not sink in the manner of atolls andvolcanic islands,which subside as they drift away from the mantle plume that created them. The islands were also far enough from former ice sheets that they were less affected by changes in the Earthâs shape caused by ice pressing down on the crust. âThe Seychelles was really a serendipitous find in many ways,â Dutton said. The islandsâ long-term stability made them ideal for comparing sea levels from ancient times to those seen today. If researchers found evidence of a reef on land that is now above water, they could be relatively certain it wasnât because the land had moved â it was because the oceans had changed. Dutton arrived on La Digue, the countryâs third-most-populated island, in the summer of 2009. With only a rough geologic map and local lore to guide them, she and her colleagues began to scour the island seeking traces of chunks â the fossilized form of a coralâs calcium carbonate skeleton. But many of the sites that residents already knew of were too weathered and broken for the kinds of chemical analysis Duttonâs team hoped to do. They would have to find lesser-known fossils, ones that were hidden enough to remain almost pristine. For days, the researchers scrambled over rocks and burrowed into crevices, dodging spiderwebs and drawing quizzical looks from beachgoers. The stifling humidity left them drenched in sweat. The sharp quartz crystals of the granite bit into their palms. Finally, at the edge of a beach called Anse Source DâArgent, Duttonâs colleague Dan Zwartz came upon a column of coral wedged between two boulders the size of trucks. The rest of the team clambered over to the fossil, running their hands along the jagged surface. Perched beside the outcrop, they could look across the tops of palm trees and see the ocean gleaming more than 25 feet below. âWe were so excited,â Dutton said. âThey were the highest corals we had seen anywhere.â Becausecoralscan grow only underwater, the fossils proved that oceans here were once at least as high as the top of the outcrop. The limestone column was like the notches parents make on kitchen walls to track their childrenâs height: a marker of what the world once was, a reminder of how much it had changed. Eventually, Duttonâs findings would bepublishedin a scientific journal andcitedby the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They would add to a growing realization among researchers thatsea levels in Earthâs recent pastreached heights that would be devastating today. But even in the moment, as she gazed out at the ocean, it was clear to Dutton that her discovery was cause for alarm. Most of La Digue â a quaint community of colorful bungalows and unpaved streets â was well below the level of the fossils. âOh, this is for real,â Dutton recalled thinking, as she watched wave after wave roll toward her. âAll this could be covered again.â Contrary to depictions in grade-school textbooks, the Earth is not a perfectly round sphere, spinning through space on a preciselypredictable path. The planet is bulging and irregular â jagged along mountain ranges and wide in the middle. It teeters like a top as it rotates on its axis. The shape of the Earthâs annual journey around the sun is in flux, as Jupiter and Saturn play gravitational tug-of-war with our orbit. All this commotion has a profound effect on climate, altering how the sunâs energy falls across the surface of the Earth. If conditions are right and the Northern Hemisphere, which is home to most of the Earthâs land area, receives a little less solar energy, it can cool the entire globe, plunging the world into anice age. But if the Northern Hemisphere gets a bit of extra sunlight, it can trigger a cascade of processes that cause the ice sheets to melt. Temperatures rise, and the world enters a warm period known as an interglacial. For the past several thousand years, humanity has enjoyed a particularly stable and mild interglacial. Relatively constant temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations enabled the development of agriculture, the construction of cities, the invention of writing and plumbing and antibiotics. Then people started burning fossil fuels andpumping billions of tons of extra carbon into the air, warming the planet at least1.2 degrees Celsius(2.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The Earthâs average temperature has come closer to that of the Last Interglacial â the warm era before this one, between 129,000 and 116,000 years ago, when Duttonâs corals grew. The extreme height of the Seychelles fossils indicated what a repeat of Last Interglacial temperatures could do to the Earthâs ice sheets â and by extension, to global sea levels. But it wasnât enough for Dutton to know how high the oceans might get. She also wanted to understand how fast they could rise. As temperatures spiked, would the poles tend to melt gradually, like ice cubes on a warm day? Or couldparts of the ice sheetssuddenly collapse, causing a huge surge in sea levels over a short span of time? In the first case, the Seychelles would have many decades to shift homes and infrastructure away from the coasts. In the alternative scenario, the country could be inundated at any moment â requiring difficult decisions about what places to protect and what to relinquish to the sea. âIf we could say, hey, the last time this happened, it happened in 500 years or a thousand years or whatever â¦ I think that would be a huge contribution in terms of coastal planning,â Dutton said. So, four years after her initial visit, Dutton returned to the Seychelles, this time with a larger team, more advanced equipment and a new mission. She didnât just want to know how high the corals got â she wanted to understand the timing of how the reefs grew. She needed to scour each outcrop for tiny details and overlooked clues that could reveal how the corals lived and died. This was the part of her work that Dutton loved most. It made her feel like a âdetective of Earthâs past,â she often said â as though she and her colleagues were investigating a crime millennia after the fact. They would need all their wits and powers of observation â plus some advanced chemical analysis â to piece together what little evidence remained. The most scientifically valuable outcrops â like this fossil near Grand Anse Beach â were tucked among piles of granite, which protected them from weathering by wind and rain. Because the fossil was so well-preserved, Dutton could distinguish subtle variations in shape and texture between the lowest and uppermost parts of the outcrop. Perhaps, she thought, each layer represented a different period of growth, and the variations reflected changes in the reef over time. The researchers used handheld drills to extract several small, cylindrical cores from the outcrop. When they returned to their labs, they analyzed the samples for two particular elements â radioactive uranium and thorium-230 â which would help them understand when the corals grew. Uranium, which is present in seawater, gets incorporated into coral skeletons as reefs grow. But over thousands of years after a coral dies, the uranium decays into a âdaughterâ element: thorium-230. Comparing the ratio of those elements, combined with other kinds of analysis, revealed that this coral had lived about 126,000 years ago. Details within the outcrop helped determine what corals composed the ancient reef. These flower-shaped holes are characteristic of corals from the Goniastreagenus â usually found within three to six feet of the sea surface. Now Dutton knew not only the age of the fossil but the probable height of the ocean when it was growing. Dutton and her colleagues performed the same careful analysis for each part of the outcrop. Atop the Goniastrealayer was a blanket of calcium carbonate secreted by a species known as Millepora exaesa, which tends to grow atop dead reefs. Just above the gap was another thin layer of coral whose uranium-thorium ratio suggested that it was roughly 123,000 to 124,00 years old. The team detected similar patterns at seven other outcrops around the Seychelles. At each site they examined, the reefs seemed to grow a few feet, die, grow back even higher, die again and then grow back once more â all in a span of just a few thousand years. That pattern suggested that the waters around the Seychelles rose, fell and then spiked back up several times â with each spike raising sea levels even higher than they were before. If plotted on a graph, the changing height of the ocean would look less like a smooth diagonal line than a broken staircase for giants, climbing upward in short, dramatic surges. The dating methods Duttonâs team used allowed them to pinpoint the timing of these pulses to within a 500-year span. But details in the fossil reefâs structure suggested that some of the spikes in sea level may have happened even faster than that, within the 100- to 200-year life span of a single coral. If oceans rose like that again, Dutton said, it would be devastating forsmall island nationslike the Seychelles. âBecause that means itâs not just going to be gradual,â she said. âIt could be like, whoop, there goes a whole half a meter all at once.â For centuries, life in the Seychelles has centered on the meeting of land and sea. The low-lying coastal plateaus that curve around the bases of the steep granite islands offer the only flat ground in the country. Much of the capital city, Victoria, has been built on reclaimed land along the shore. The airport, power stations, hospitals and about 90 percent of the population can be found within afew yards of sea level.The countryâs two biggest industries â tourism and fishing â depend upon pristine waters and immaculate beaches. âThe coast is our number one asset,â said sustainable-development consultant Didier Dogley, who previously served as the Seychellesâ tourism minister and environment chief. âVery early on, we understood that the only way to survive on this rock is to protect the nature thatâs around us.â But thewarming, surging ocean threatens that crucial coastline â and with it, the Seychellesâ entire existence.

Rising water temperatures have alsointensified the cyclonesthat form in the Indian Ocean, creating powerful storm surges that inundate the Seychellesâ shores. Almost every winter, torrential rains compounded by increasingly high tides lead to flooding in La Digueâs main village. Streets turn to unnavigable pools of mud. The communityâs septic systems become overwhelmed, spilling sewage into the open. Even when the sun shines, the encroaching ocean is expanding marshes and contaminating ground water, says Melton Ernesta, a 64-year-old bar manager and community leader. As a board member for the LâUnion Estate Parkand demonstration farm, he has watched crops wither in soil that has become contaminated by salt. And at Anse Source DâArgent â the scenic beach where Dutton found her first fossils â acres of soft white sand have been washed away by the steadily rising tide. The water seeps under walls that are supposed to contain it and scrapes earth from beneath the roots of the shading takamaka trees. Just a few feet away, a chunk of ancient coral looms over the eroded beach path. Like many La Digue residents, Ernesta grew up hearing about the history the fossils represented and the warnings for the future they held. âItâs very emotional for me to know that where we are standing now, everything was underwater,â Ernesta says. âMaybe now, the planet is taking it back.â Alone amid a vast ocean, nearly 1,000 miles from the nearest land, the Seychelles can seem separate from the rest of the globe â quite literally an island on its own. But nearly every Seychellois will tell you the opposite is true. Most of their food must be imported from elsewhere. Their cars, appliances and fuel all come from overseas. Though the nation has banned plastic bags, polyethylene flotsam from far-flung places routinely washes up on their shores. Thecoronavirus pandemicwas a stark reminder of the countryâs vulnerability to world events, Ernesta says. With less than a third of its usual tourism revenue, GDP fell by more than 10 percent, according to a U.N. Development Program report. Unemployment doubled. Prices spiked. Nothing makes Ernesta feel his countryâs interdependence more than climate change. The Seychelles accounts for less than a tenth of a percentage point of all the greenhouse gases ever released into the atmosphere. Indeed, withhalf of its land areaand30 percent of its oceansprotected, the countryâs forests and seagrass meadows currentlypull more carbon out of the air than its people emit. Yet the nation is listed sixth in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiativeâsranking of countries most exposed to climate impacts. U.N. scientistsprojectthat the sea level around the Seychelles will rise by another 2 to 2.5 feet by the end of the century â enough to inundate 1 in 8 buildings and 42 percent of major roads on the main island of MahÃ©, according to the countryâscoastal management plan. Scientists have identified almost 150 endangered species on the islands that could be driven to extinction by climate change. A recent report from the International Monetary Fund found that coping with global warming will cost the Seychelles about30 percent of its gross domestic product. The country is wealthier per capita than any other African nation, thanks largely to an economy fueled by carbon-intensive international travel. But its small size still leaves it short on the resources and expertise needed to protect against rising sea levels, surging ocean temperatures, intensifying rainfall and escalating heat. âWe are suffering, but we are not the ones damaging,â Ernesta says. Seychellois say their survival depends on larger nations with more economic clout drastically reducing their own carbon pollution to avoid further warming. So far, the opposite is happening: Global greenhouse gas emissionsset a new record this year. âItâs like, when the elephants fight, the grass gets crushed,â Ernesta adds. âWe are the grass.â There is another force linking the Seychelles to distant parts of the planet â one that scientists are just beginning to understand. As researchers like Dutton accumulated evidence of ancient sea levels all over the globe, they started to notice surprising discrepancies in their data. Fossils on one continent seemed to suggest sea levels that were inches, even feet higher than fossils of the same age from another part of the world. In some cases, sea levels in far northern locales seemed to fall even as waters were rising everywhere else. The explanation was in the ice. Theice sheetsthat cover the Earthâs poles are so massive, they exert a gravitational pull on water in oceans. Their weight compresses the continents underneath them and pushes Earthâs crust upward elsewhere â the same way sitting on a couch can cause the cushions to bulge to the sides. These phenomena can cause sea levels to rise near the ice sheets and fall in the mid-latitudes. Fig.3. GREENLAND Equator Seychelles ANTARCTICA GREENLAND Seychelles Equator ANTARCTICA GREENLAND Equator Seychelles ANTARCTICA GREENLAND Equator Seychelles ANTARCTICA When the ice melts, its gravity weakens, and the Earthâs crust is able to bounce back. The ocean falls near the poles, and water surges in the opposite direction. The result is that each ice sheet produces a distinctive pattern of sea level rise known as a âfingerprint,â which can help scientists understand what places were most affected in the past â or will be most at risk in the future. The Seychelles, which are located almost on top of the equator, are in the worst possible spot. No matter which ice sheet is melting, the islands will experience 9 to 24 percent more sea level rise than the global average, according to a2014 studyin the journal Quaternary Science Reviews. This fingerprint research is helping Dutton determine what her Seychelles findings meant for the oceans across the rest of the Last Interglacial world. Meanwhile, in new work presented at recent scientific conferences, Dutton drew on evidence from climate models, deep ocean sediments and polar ice cores to determine which ice sources were most likely responsible for the pulses of sea level rise recorded in the fossil reefs. Her âworking hypothesis,â she said, is that the first burst of melting probably came from Antarctica.Then the Northern Hemisphere started warming up, causing another pulse of sea level rise from the Arctic region. Finally, the northern ice sheets unleashed one last spurt of meltwater, before the planet tilted back into a cooling phase and the Last Interglacial came to an end. âWhatâs happening with those pulses of sea level rise is itâs actually the two ice sheets kind of competing against each other â one is getting smaller while the other one is growing,â Dutton said. âAnd so itâs like this back and forth, and thatâs why it goes up and then it goes down a little bit and then it goes up again.â Alessio Rovere, a coastal geologist at Caâ Foscari University of Venice, said Duttonâs findings add to a growing body of evidence that the Last Interglacial ice sheets didnât melt simultaneously, causing sea levels to surge upward in multiple, sudden spurts. âWe can use it as a benchmark for what could happen in a future that is slightly warmer,â Rovere said, helping scientists develop better models of how modern ice sheets will behave. But there is a key difference between the Last Interglacial and today, Dutton warned. Back then, the poles alternated warming, so melting from one ice sheet was buffered by the other. Now, the whole planet is warming at the same time as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions. Both Greenland and Antarcticaare crumbling at once. And the Seychelles, positioned at just the wrong distance from both ice sheets, will be on the receiving end of that surge. In recent years, as the revelations of her research have become clearer and the realities of climate change have gotten worse, Dutton has sought any opportunity to talk with the public about her work. She has given presentations to neighborhood groups and coastal planning commissions, appeared on podcasts, testified before the U.S. Senate. Often, her audiencesâ reactions feel painfully shortsighted, she says. People dismiss thelessons of Earth historyas too distant to be relevant. They balk at the suggestion of spending money today to protect against the possibility of a disaster tomorrow. They believe thatclimate changeis something that will happen to unknown people, someplace far away. The geology of the Seychelles defies such myopia. Here, the past is a fossil people can touch. The future is a wave already eating away at the shore. And every carbon dioxide molecule emitted anywhere on the planet is a threat to Seychelloisâ narrow strip of habitable coastline. Each fraction of a degree that the Earthâs temperature rises is a step toward re-creating the world that the fossil corals knew. With his palm pressed against the Anse Source DâArgent outcrop, Ernesta finds himself thinking about the Seychelles his ancestors encountered when the first people came here 253 years ago. The wide beaches and Edenic forests. The rare plants and unusual creatures. âI feel that we have to protect,â he says, speaking slowly as he searches for the right words. âWe have to protect for generations and generations, [for them] to come and to see our planet. How â how it was. And how it still is today.â Fingerprints, or local sea level changes caused by melting ice, are from âConsistency in the fingerprints of projected sea level change 2015-2100CEâ by Cederberg et al. (2023). Population numbers are mid-2023 estimates from the Seychelles National Bureau of Statistics. Sea level projections are based on the IPCCâs Sixth Assessment Report and assume 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 relative to 1850-1900. Areas marked at risk on the map have an elevation of 1.64 meters or below, which accounts for 0.64 meters of sea level rise in addition to 1 meter for high tides. The elevation model was provided by the Seychelles Ministry of Agriculture, Climate Change and Environment.

226,Washington Post,New college grads are more likely to be unemployed in today’s job market,Abha Bhattarai and Abha Bhattarai,"Lucas Chung graduated in May with a hefty resume: A near-perfect college GPA, several internships and a stint running cross-country for Team USA. Since then he’s applied to hundreds of jobs, but has ended up with little more than a pile of rejection letters. “I had high hopes but it's not really working out for me,” said Chung, 22, who double-majored in political science and communications at St. Mary’s College of California. “I’m feeling a little desperate.” Despite a surprisingly robust job market,recent college graduates have been having a harder time finding work than the rest of the population since the pandemic. This marks a sharpreversal from long-held norms, when a newly-minted college degree all but guaranteed a better shot at employment.Since 1990, the unemployment rate for recent grads almost always has been lower than for the general population. But that changed after covid. New grads have consistently fared worse than other jobseekers since January 2021, and that gap has only widened in recent months. Thelatest unemployment rate for recent graduates, at 4.4 percent, is higher than the overall joblessness rate and nearly double the rate for all workers with a college degree, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Part of the problem is that the industries with the biggest worker shortages — including restaurants, hotels, day cares and nursing homes — aren’t necessarily where recent graduates want to work. Meanwhile, the industries where they do want to work — tech, consulting, finance, media — are announcing layoffs and rethinking hiring plans. “Recent college graduates are very sensitive to the state of the labor market,” said Harry Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown University and former Labor Department chief economist. “There’s been some softening in hiring, and young people in general are the first to feel it.” The result is yet another disruption for a generation of college graduates who have already had crucial years of schooling upended by the pandemic. In interviews, many said they’d struggled to adjust to remote-learning in early 2020 and felt like they had missed out on opportunities to forge connections with professors, employers and other students that could have been crucial in lining up for postgraduate work. Now, as they enter the workforce, they say they’re feeling increasingly disillusioned about the economy, which is fueling political discontent and causing them to rethink the financial independence they thought they’d achieve after college. “It’s been really difficult,” said Christian Torres, 24, who graduated this spring with an electrical engineering degree from Arizona State University and is still looking for work. “Even the entry-level engineering jobs want four or five years of experience. There’s no way to compete, so I’m still living at home, still looking for work.” Michelle Singletary: 6 money tips new graduates should know More than half —about 55 percent— of young adults lived with their parents last year, down from pandemic-era peaks but higher than in 2019, census data shows. A combination of a softening job market, ballooning student debt and lingering inflation have forced many to rethink their post-graduation living arrangements. In California, Chung recently took the only job he could find, as a front-desk attendant for a hotel. He makes $19.20 an hour, more than the minimum wage buttoo little to live onin Sonoma County. He can’t afford to move out of his parents’ home and is still applying for work, though the rejections keep mounting, even for positions he feels overqualified for, such as receptionist or car rental agent. The share of recent graduates who, like Chung,are underemployed— or working in jobs that typically do not require a college degree — has picked up this year, from 38 percent to 40 percent, according to the New York Fed. By comparison, the share of all college graduates considered underemployed has remained steady at 33 percent. That souring outlook is fueling broader discontent among young Americans, who are disproportionately focused on economic issues such as jobs, taxes and the cost of living, according to a recent New York Times-Siena College poll. A stunning 93 percent of young adults in battleground states said the economy was fair or poor, compared with 81 percent of the overall population, the poll showed. Meanwhile less than 1 percent of adults between 18 and 29 rated the economy as “excellent,” the lowest of any age group. Those grievances could create new challenges for President Biden as he seeks reelection next year. Although60 percentof young adults voted for Biden in the 2020, the highest share of any age group, that support appears to be waning. Are young voters actually split between Trump and Biden? “College graduates are used to having it pretty good and getting much higher earnings, much lower unemployment,” said Holzer of Georgetown. “They had high expectations, and you can understand why they might feel disappointed if they’re experiencing difficulty finding a job.” College officials nationwide say companies are still recruiting with gusto at campus job fairs and other events. But there are also signs of a slowdown in actual hiring, particularly by big tech firms and consulting companies that have long been popular destinations for graduating seniors. “Employer engagement is still very high but at the same time, we’re seeing an uptick in students expressing frustration with their job searches,” said Suzanne Helbig, associate vice provost of the University of California Irvine’s division of career pathways. “It’s become more difficult to land interviews, and not as many students are coming to us with job offers.” The economy is booming, but inflation continues to sour Americans Similarly, at Michigan State University, the share of undergraduate students securing full-time jobs within six months of graduationfell last year, to 56 percent from 62 percent the year before. More students also reported taking on part-time work and searching for employment than in 2021. Kyle Ciambrone, who lives in New Jersey, graduated with a marketing degree from Monmouth University in 2020 just as the world was shutting down. His options were limited, so he took a job delivering pizzas, then another one processing returns at a warehouse. Since then he’s applied to as many as 50 office jobs a week but has yet to find something long-term. “I always just expected that you’d go to school, get your degree and end up working some sort of office job that pays enough to live on,” Ciambrone, 25, said. “That’s the way it worked for my dad and my brother, who’s 10 years older than me. But that doesn’t seem possible anymore.” The most-regretted (and lowest-paying) college majors The issue, some economists say, is not so much that recent college graduates are falling behind. Instead, workers without degrees are finally getting a leg up. Demand for workers has been brisk in industries like leisure and hospitality, child care and manufacturing, which typically don’t require a college degree. Construction postings on the jobs site Indeed, for example, are up 50 percent from pre-pandemic levels, while software development and marketing openings have fallen about 20 to 25 percent. “The labor market is tougher if you’re a recent grad, but this is really a story about how the job market has been really good for people without a degree,” said Kory Kantenga, senior economist at Linked In. There are other dynamics at play, too. Recent graduates — who spent months, if not years, learning virtually during the pandemic — are increasingly looking for hybrid and remote work arrangements, which means competing with a large swath of applicants around the country. They are also losing out to newly-laid off tech and media workers with real-world experience, according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at Zip Recruiter. The great mismatch: Remote jobs are in demand, but positions are drying up The slowing economy is also playing a role. The Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates in hopes of bringing down inflation, which has brought the real estate market to a standstill and raised borrowing costs for all types of businesses. “There’s tremendous uncertainty in tech and banking — companies aren’t going public, there are very few mergers,” Pollak said “These companies — all destinations for college grads — are being very cautious, very cost-conscious at the moment. And until that dynamic turns around, these younger, less-experienced workers are going to be the ones who are marginalized and stuck on the sidelines.” In Pennsylvania, Amber was finishing her junior year at a liberal arts college when covid forced everyone to go home. She welcomed the change at first — she’s introverted, she said, and felt more comfortable attending classes remotely. But now she wonders if there were drawbacks, too. “It was hard to use my resources and connect with people,” said Amber, 25, who spoke on the condition that The Post identify her by her first name for fear of putting off potential employers. “I’m a really shy person and that was even harder to do from home. I should’ve gone to the employment office, I should’ve made more connections.” How the restart of student loan payments is affecting these borrowers’ lives Amber graduated with a physics degree in 2021 and took a job making $10 an hour at a call center. She quit a year later because of frequent harassment, figuring she could easily find another job. That hasn’t been the case: After a year and half of searching for jobs in engineering, customer service, tutoring and IT, she’s still struggling to get an offer. Amber estimates she’s sent out more than 1,000 applications on Indeed.com. She’s been covering rent by posting photos and videoson Only Fans, the digital subscription service for online creators. “Forget finding work that makes me happy or fulfilled,” Amber said.“At this point, I’m just trying to do anything that will help me pay rent. It feels demoralizing.” Meanwhile, Chung, who’s working at a hotel in California, has begun cold-calling law firms looking for work. He’s also started studying for the LSAT. Maybe, he says, he’ll just go to law school. “I had a bit of a feeling it’d be hard to find a job,” he said. “But I didn’t expect it to be this bad.”","November 19, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
227,Washington Post,Catholic priests are warning about Argentina’s Trump. Will that stop him?,Samantha Schmidt and Samantha Schmidt,"BUENOS AIRES — In his 30 years as a priest, Rodolfo Viano never imagined he would find himself here, knocking on doors to warn neighbors about a threat to democracy. But days before Argentina’s presidential election, for at least the 10th time in recent months, he walked down the dirt road of his working-class neighborhood outside Buenos Aires, hoping to  persuade undecided voters to “make the best decision possible.” “We’re a group of Christians, of priests, and we’re handing out fliers for you to take into account next Sunday,” Viano, a 64-year-old Franciscan, told one young man under the blazing sun. “We’re not telling you who to vote for. But we don’t want to let ourselves get carried away by hate, by anger or enthusiasm.” He didn’t have to say the candidate’s name for the young man to know whom he was talking about: Javier Milei, the brash libertarian economist who once described Argentine Pope Francis as “evil,” and who now promises to tear down the political establishment. The wild-haired, charismatic 53-year-old Milei has drawn comparisons to Donald Trumpand Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Like them, he has galvanized masses of voters with populist rhetoric — capitalizing on anger toward a Peronista government that has struggled to get a grip on the country’s worst economic crisis in two decades. Argentina’s tear-it-all-down frontrunner connects with angry young men He has also mobilized a swell of Argentines such as Viano to take to the streets and urge people to vote against him — even if it means voting for Sergio Massa, the minister currently overseeing the floundering economy. “Democracy is at risk. The moment justifies it,” Viano said. Since the end of Argentina’s military dictatorship 40 years ago,he said,“this is the moment when democracy has been in the greatest danger.” Billboards in Buenos Aires flash the words “Milei no.” Several of Argentina’s most important soccer clubs, and a small army of Swifties,have spoken out against him. Coalitions of academic researchers, leading economists and victims of the country’s military dictatorship have signed statements raising alarm about a possible Milei presidency. Viralvideoshavecirculatedshowing Argentines in subway cars standing up to make the case against him. In Argentina, fans camped out for six months to see Taylor Swift The subway monologues and door-knocking priests are part of a wave of “micro-activism” in the country’s presidential campaigns, said Argentine public opinion analyst Shila Vilker. “People who don’t normally go out started going out onto the streets,” Vilker said. “The question is what kind of impact will this have on voters.” After similar anyone-but-this-guy campaigns failed to stop Trump in the United States and Bolsonaro in Brazil, will Argentina be any different? Just as in the United States in the 2016 presidential race, religious leaders have played an unusually active role in the campaign against Milei. One group of 40 Catholic priests released alettersaying they “are convinced it is a moral imperative to do everything within our reach to prevent that Milei becomes president.” Pope Francis himself appeared to make a subtle reference to Milei in aninterviewwith an Argentine news outlet, criticizing what he called “messianic” solutions to a crisis. Last week, in Matanza, a Buenos Aires suburb, about two dozen priests held a Mass to pray for Francis’s return to Argentina for the first time since the start of his papacy. But the Mass also had a political overtone. Two ministers of the current government attended, greeting the different priests. “This town has a dream of peace and freedom,” said one priest from the province of Córdoba. “But true freedom, not the selfish freedom that they want to sell us. We dream of the return of Francisco. But it is also important that each of us knows how to recognize that we carry the shepherd’s staff, and we have to take it out at this crucial hour in our history.” The grass-roots anti-Milei campaign and the formal Massa campaign emphasize the idea that Milei is a threat to democracy. For president, Argentina to choose between anger and fear Milei, like Trump, has shown a tendency to fight with the news media and to raise unsubstantiated claims about electoral fraud. In presidential debates, he cast doubt on the symbolic yet widely accepted tally of murders during the country’s Dirty War from 1976 to 1983. His running mate, Victoria Villarruel, gained prominence advocating for soldiers convicted of human rights abuses during the dictatorship. Some of the fears about Milei, though, are exaggerated, argued political analyst Lucas Romero. And the warnings may not resonate with voters worried that their salaries haven’t kept up with inflation and who have seen their savings vanish as the Argentine peso plummeted. “They are trying to scare the public with a fear of a democratic rupture,” Romero said. “But it’s an electorate that is terrified about an economic situation that is much more urgent than democracy.” Political analyst Federico Aurelio assessed that the swell of activism and attempts to stoke fear over a Milei presidency would do little to sway voters who are demanding a drastic change. “It’s not that people aren’t interested in democracy,” he said. “Even if they have some doubts about Milei’s issues, his voters simply don’t believe that democracy is at stake.” Milei has pledged to shut down the central bank and take a “chain saw” to government spending. His surprise win in the primaries in August sent shock waves through the economy, and trepidation about a Milei presidency helped deliver Massa a lead in the first round of voting last month. But now, after Milei managed to consolidate the support of the center-right establishment, the libertarian has a razor-thin lead over Massa in the polls. “They are going to try to continue spreading fear,” he said in one of his last campaign events before the vote. It’s the poverty rate and the inflation rate, he said, that are the real “tunnel of terror.” Many Argentines feel overwhelmed by what they see as two bad options: a continuation of Peronismo or a radical shift to the right. As Viano walked from door to door in the neighborhood outside Buenos Aires, the priest knew that many of the families were still undecided — even in a district known as a bastion for Peronismo, where blue pro-Massa murals were splashed across walls. “We have to speed up our pace,” he told the woman helping him, Emma Almirón, a 76-year-old activist who was exiled to Spain during the military dictatorship. At each door, Viano clapped over the sounds of barking dogs to get the attention of residents. Then he slipped a flier in the gate or mailbox. While the flier didn’t name Milei, it gave a subtle warning: “While democracy returned, there are false politicians who try to impose a destructive plan, putting the brakes on the common good.” Many of those who came to the door were lifelong Peronistas who already planned to vote for Massa. But many others were undecided — or leaning toward Milei. There was the 48-year-old woman drinking maté who wanted change but was afraid of what a Milei presidency would entail. There was the 60-year-old blacksmith with a paint-splattered shirt, who hasn’t been able to find work, could hardly afford to buy meat, and argued that the Peronistas in power only end up benefiting “their own pockets.” There was the tattooed 24-year-old smoking a cigarette who has worked for eight years as a bricklayerbut has struggled to save up for a house or a car of his own — and keep up with the soaring inflation. He plans to vote for Milei. “He’s the only person I see that’s different from what we already have and what we already had,” Marcelo Revainera said. “I’m not convinced by a lot of what he says. But I’d rather have someone different, not the same that we’ve had for 15 years. I want a change.”","November 17, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
228,Washington Post,"How the National Zoo weighs its animals, from elephants to red pandas",Lee Powell and Lee Powell and Lee Powell and Lee Powell,"At the Smithsonianâs National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, weigh-ins are a way of life. Animals are routinely weighed by zookeepers who monitor their development and well-being. In return for having to hop, slide or slither onto a scale, the animals get a reward: a fat, juicy worm or a slice of their favorite fruit. The Smithsonian has nearly 400 different species, and each one requires special attention. Newly born black-footed ferrets need to be weighed at least once a week to make sure theyâre healthy, while mature male animals like Gunther the gray seal and Spike the Asian elephant need to pack on the pounds during breeding season. Some creatures, like the Japanese giant salamander, just need a routine checkup once or twice a year. But knowing an animalâs weight is also important if a creature suddenly needs medicine, because weight dictates the dosage. So, how exactly do you get a salamander or a seal on a scale? Take a look: Getting a bird to land on a scale is hard enough â even if that dish has wiggly worms on it.   grams Similar in weight to: Five sugar packets Songbirds are neophobic â meaning theyâre scared of new things, said Shelby Burns, a bird keeper at the National Zooâs Bird House. It takes keepers a long time to acclimate these birds to strange objects like electronic scales, but enticing them with their favorite bugs for their monthly weigh-ins helps. The red-eyed vireo, an olive-green songbird with red irises, eats insects in the spring and summer. In the fall, these birds feast on seeds and berries to give them enough energy for their long migratory flight to South America, where they winter. During breeding season, the zoo feeds them a mix of bugs and eggs, Burns said, to ensure they have enough calcium and protein to lay eggs. With their expressive faces and compact stature, black-footed ferrets may not look like ferocious hunters. But make no mistake: These creatures are a prairie dogâs worst nightmare. A black-footed ferretâs diet is 90 percent prairie dog, and they rely on their burrows for their homes. AVG  grams Similar in weight to: A small handheld flashlight When cattle ranchers and landowners sought topoison and kill prairie dogs, their actions made these ferrets more scarce, too. Black-footed ferrets were presumed extinct by 1980, until a small group of them was discovered on a Wyoming farm. They are still considered one of the most endangered mammals in North America. When we visited, the Smithsonianâs National Zoo had 33 adults and 51 kits, or babies. The zoo feeds them horsemeat and rats. Live rats are given to mothers so they can teach their young how to hunt. Native to the deserts of North Africa, fennec foxes are the smallest of the canid species and donât really hang out with humans. Getting 9-year-old Barkley to approach a keeper and then step onto a scale took training to make him less skittish, keeper Mimi Nowlin said.   pounds Similar in weight to: A pair of womenâs shoes Now, when keepers say the word âtarget,â Barkley uses his nose to tap the end of a stick. Itâs a way to get him to move to a certain spot. He knows what comes next: soft bits of meat. Thereâs a small dead mouse, too, as a grand prize. In the wild, fennec foxes eat insects, rodents, lizards, birds and eggs. Consuming roots, leaves and fruit helps them hydrate. As desert dwellers, they can go for long stretches without water. These primates are mobile and highly curious, and their tiny, humanlike hands allow them to climb and grasp a variety of objects. AVG  pounds Similar in weight to: A newborn baby Red ruffed lemurs usually maintain a consistent weight, keeper Esther Wray said. During mating season, they may get lighter because theyâre more active. Lemurs live in a protected area on the island of Madagascar. They use their limbs to move in all kinds of ways on the forest floor and on the branches above, searching for veggies and fruit. At the zoo, their diet includes squash, green peppers, corn, sweet potatoes and carrots. With so many trees and rocks to climb, getting two red pandas to step on a scale is like herding cats. Red pandas are more closely related to raccoons or skunks than giant panda bears, but they do share the same forests as pandas and also eat bamboo.   pounds Similar in weight to: A bowling ball And, like pandas, they have instantly Instagram-able faces. To get Asa and Chris-Anne to the scale, keeper Trish Jarvis has blueberries, grapes and apple slices on standby. The zoo weighs them biweekly to make sure their diet is balanced and right. Red pandas mostly eat bamboo, which isnât exactly high in calories. To meet their nutritional needs, the zoo also gives them biscuits and fruit. If you live in water and youâre nocturnal, a late-morning wake-up call that yanks you out of aquatic blisscan be pretty annoying.   pounds Similar in weight to: An average road bike Hiro is a Japanese giant salamander out of water. Yes, heâs squirming in the plastic tub placed on an electronic scale. Yes, that rubbery, musky odor is coming from him, too. Pungent point taken, Hiro. The National Zoo has four Japanese giant salamanders. Hiro moves among three interconnected 718-gallon tanks.Except for the occasional weigh-in or vet check, these creatures are hardly ever touched. They are the second-largest salamander species in the world, behind the Chinese giant salamander. Their North American kin is the hellbender, found in the South and in the eastern United States. The likes of Hiro live in streams and eat fish, frogs, crabs and even the occasional rodent, Kyle Miller said. But they donât eat that often: A slow metabolism means they can go weeks without feasting. Cheetahs have the willowy build of a track star. Their slender frame, light skeleton and long limbs enable them to achieve speeds of 60 to 70 mph.   pounds Similar in weight to: A large bookcase But itâs really their sharp turns and sudden stops that make themsuccessful predators. They have a remarkable ability toaccelerate and change directionwhen hunting their prey. They also have a powerful bite and suffocation technique. In the wild, cheetahs go after small animals like rabbits, as well as young antelope, wildebeests and zebras. Yet despite its speed and maneuverability, only about half of their hunts are successful. As of this summer, the National Zoo had 24 adult cheetahs and two youngsters, both 10 months old. The cheetahs here get weighed monthly. The Smithsonian says there are 7,500 to 10,000 cheetahs in the wild, mostly concentrated in southern Africa. However, their numbers are shrinking due tohabitat lossandoverhunting. Sahel is a shy dama gazelle. On this day, his timid nature is endearing. The 15-year-old wanders out of his stall and onto the scale as part of a weekly ritual.   pounds Similar in weight to: Two full-size mattresses These gazelles are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Fewer than 300remain in the wild, according to keeper Dolores Reed. Habitat loss has pushed the dama gazelle to the fringes of the sub-Saharan desert. The shrubs and acacia trees they rely on have been cleared to make room for domesticated livestock. Theyâre also threatened by overhunting and poaching. Reed says dama gazelles have ended up as bushmeat for people and armies in nations that are experiencing ongoing conflict, such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad. Still, Reed says thereâs an effort to reintroduce the dama gazelle to Chad as part of alarger planthat also involves the oryx and addax, also part of the antelope family. Getting Gunther the gray seal on a scale doesnât just take snacks. It takes patience.   pounds Similar in weight to: A vending machine âI canât force this 600-pound seal to do anything,â keeper Sam Milne said. But she can do positive reinforcement training, a common zoo practice: Ask an animal to do something, and if they do it, they get a reward. Gunther is a well-trained seal: He was born at the Los Angeles Zoo and has been around humans his entire life. He knows how to get on a door-size scale and stay awake for injections, blood draws and other treatments. The zooâs five gray seals are fed herring, butterfish, capelin, mackerel and squid. They do weigh-ins once a week. At close to 13,000 pounds, Spike is one of the zooâs biggest animals. Measuring him takes an industrial-size scale.   pounds Similar in weight to: A heavy-duty pickup Heâs been at the zoo since 2018, coming from Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Florida. He is one of seven Asian elephants at the zoo, but the only male. Asian elephants are smaller than those in Africa â down to their flappy ears. Spike is weighed weekly, and his stats are sent to the zooâs nutrition department for any dietary tweaks. The usual fareis hay, fruits, vegetables and other nutrient-dense items. Spike is on the heavier side now, but thatâs good for a male elephant going through musth cycles when testosterone levels ... spike. Design and development by Alexis Arnold.

229,Washington Post,It doesn’t matter who coaches the Commanders now. It matters who’s next.,Barry Svrluga and Barry Svrluga,"What remains now are only the logistics. Can Ron Rivera be removed from his job Monday, with the Washington Commanders on a short week before a Thursday date at Dallas? Or does it make more sense to do it just after the holiday, so whoever’s keeping the seat warm can have more than three days to prepare for the next opponent? After the bye week? Or after the season? The more to-the-point question: Does it really matter? This Commanders season became a foregone conclusion earlier than normal. Maybe we should be thankful there’s no tease about what’s possible. Still, it’s a shame Thanksgiving isn’t even here and the most important person in the building isn’t the guy who coaches the team but whoever’s next. Eric Bieniemy? Ben Johnson? Bill …Belichick? Whoever. We have time for that. Ready for the specifics that got us here, before the holidays are even in full swing? The Commanders lost Sunday to the New York Giants in a mostly unwatchable 31-19 debacle in which Washington turned the ball oversixtimes. The last of those: an embarrassment-sealing interception of Sam Howell by New York linebacker Isaiah Simmons, who mocked the home team by falling backward across the goal line to complete his 54-yard score. Why shouldn’t he? The Giants are 2-0 against the Commanders. They are 1-8 against the rest of the NFL. Ron Rivera says focus is on QB development, not his future Under the old ownership regime, this is where we would link the putrid on-field result with the fact that neither locker room had hot water so the players could comfortably shower afterward. Then we would make a joke about how the stench of the game followed the Commanders home. (Insert rimshot here.) This is, though, a new era, the relentless beatdown of Daniel Snyder replaced with theoptimism of Josh Harris. The jokes aren’t supposed to apply. Yet here we are. Put the showers aside. Concentrate on the results. How can this be happening in the fourth year of a program that Rivera keeps arguing is showing growth? “No matter what my answer is, it’s going to come out, and people are going to say it’s an excuse,” Rivera said. “So we’re just going to take the responsibility and show up tomorrow and get prepared.” Prepared for … packing up the office? Or the flight to Dallas? The quarterback who beat the Commanders: Tommy De Vito, whom I remember as being great in “Taxi” and even better in “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” I had no idea he could find wide-open receivers roaming on massive swaths of turf, the members of Washington’s alleged secondary nowhere to be found. De Vito, an undrafted rookie, is the Giants’ third-string quarterback. On Sunday, he took nine sacks — and still hung in there to throw for 246 yards with three touchdowns and no picks. This isn’t just the kind of thing that happens to the Commanders or the Washington Football Team or the Banished Team Names over time. This is what has happened to Rivera’steams, in particular. So whether Harris acts this week or the day after the season, he will act. He must act. It’s obvious. “It is a low point, that’s for sure,” Rivera said. “Anytime you’ve got an opportunity to win a football game and you put the numbers up that you did, you got to come through.” At this point, that’s filler. At this point, there really aren’t answers. Rivera knows it. In mulling his own future — inevitable as it seems — Rivera sounded beaten down Friday whileanswering questions from The Washington Post’s Nicki Jhabvala. “S---, I’ve been through enough,” he said — and he’s not wrong, what with his cancer diagnosis during his first season, then with the constant tumult as the NFL investigated and essentially suspended Snyder, leaving Rivera to answer questions he had no business facing. “The last 3½ years have not been easy,” Rivera continued. “Anybody who thinks it’s been easy, to hell with them. And I’ll be honest with you because that’s how I feel about the last three years. It’s been a lot. We’ve done a lot.” Point granted that it has been a lot. Let’s quibble with how much they’ve done. Not just in roster-building but in coaching. Listen to Jonathan Allen, the seventh-year defensive tackle who had 1.5 sacks against the Giants. What has to happen to make results such as Sunday’s flip the other way? “I would say learning how to win,” Allen said. “When you look at teams around the league who are consistently successful, they know how to win different types of games. In order to win ugly, in order to win offensive and defensive games, special teams. And so for us, we just have to learn how to win in different ways.” Allen wouldn’t point at the coaching staff, but his words are telling. By this point, Rivera should have taught those different ways to win. It’s too far into his tenure — and he has too big of a role in both selecting the players and coaching them up — to say otherwise. He knows precisely what’s at stake. How Brian Robinson Jr. grew as a receiver in Eric Bieniemy’s offense “If I stay, I stay,” Rivera said Friday. “So until then, I will just continue to work. I know what my goals are. I know what my vision is. But I’m not going to shake and waver on Sam, on this offense or what we do.” The message he wants to deliver is that the culture in the building is better than when he arrived and that the Commanders may have something in Howell, the fifth-round selection in 2022 whose trajectory this season is better than Sunday’s three-interception performance would indicate. The culture part can be correct. The problem is Rivera chose Dwayne Haskins, then Ryan Fitzpatrick, then Carson Wentz as his quarterbacks before landing on Howell. If he solved Washington’s built-in quarterback carousel, he did so only after extending it. So, then, the logistics: Part of the issue with dismissing Rivera this week has to do with how quickly the next challenge is upon the team. Part has to do with the lack of a logical successor. Defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio’sperformancehas arguably been worse than Rivera’s. Bieniemy, the offensive coordinator, isin his first year calling plays, and in some ways the final six games of the season are about evaluating how important a Bieniemy-Howell pairing might be for the future. There’s no obvious place to turn. The timing, though, doesn’t much matter. What does: making the right choice going forward. Think of it this way: A generation of Washington football fans has endured losses such as Sunday’s, the kind that feel like new lows. To this point, they have come under Snyder, which added a layer of helplessness and hopelessness to it all. Sunday’s loss came under Harris. Only 11 games into his tenure, he has to be granted the benefit of the doubt to make the right decision. Eventually — next week or next month or in January — that will be dismissing Rivera. The extent of the optimism the fan base will feel from Harris’s stewardship can be enhanced if he makes an inspired and exciting choice for the next coach. It’s just a shame that it’s not even Thanksgiving and that who’s next already matters more than who’s here.","November 19, 2023 at 6:42 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
230,Washington Post,Consumers tighten spending habits ahead of holiday shopping season,Tory Newmyer and Tory Newmyer,"Consumers are in a cautious mood heading into the holiday shopping season, moderating their spending in the face of higher prices and costlier credit, signaling a likely downshift in the engine of the U.S. economy. Major retailers say their customers over the last three months have pulled back from high-ticket purchases, focused on essentials and held out for deals — a shift that industry executives and observers expect to persist into the busiest shopping period of the year. “Sales have been somewhat uneven, and this gives us reason to think slightly more cautiously about the consumer versus 90 days ago,” Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey told analysts Thursday on a call to discuss the retailer’s third-quarter earnings. The consumer restraint showed up across the economy in October, as retail sales fell by 0.1 percent from the previous month, the first such decline in six months, according to the Commerce Department. Those who were spending increasingly embraced alternative payment methods, with “buy now, pay later” purchases climbing 6 percent over the same period last year, a report by Adobe Analytics found. Customers facing squeezed budgets are subjecting their purchases to tougher scrutiny and asking themselves: “Is this really going to add value to my life?” Target’s chief growth officer, Christina Hennington, said on an earnings call this week. Other top retail executives expect more of the same: Macy’s Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell warned the company expects “the consumer to continue to be challenged”; Gap Chief Financial Officer Katrina O’Connell said the retailer is trying “really just trying to remain prudent about the consumer”; Williams-Sonoma executives noted the company has been dealing with “ongoing consumer hesitancy” even though the company remains optimistic for the holiday season. The National Retail Federation, for its part, projects holiday shoppers will step up their spending over last year but at a slower pace than in recent years. The group forecasts retail sales will increase 3 to 4 percent in November and December — a more modest bump than the 5.4 percent hike they recorded last year — as Americans reckon with new economic uncertainty. “People feel less secure about spending when they feel less confident in their jobs,” said Jack Kleinhenz, the retail group’s chief economist, pointing to a recent uptick in the unemployment rate despite what remains a historically strong job market. “The ability to spend is there, now the question is the willingness.” Accordingly, businesses are preparing for a leaner season, with listings for seasonal job openings hitting their lowest level in a decade, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks labor trends. Economists see good reason for shoppers to be wary, as both consumers and the economy itself appear to be at inflection points. Two years of red-hot inflation that sent prices soaring to 40-year highs and stretched household budgets finally looks to becooling. But to tame the phenomenon, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to their highest level in 22 years, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing. Consumers initially relied on pandemic-era emergency payments and debt forgiveness programs to patch their personal finances as prices rose. After spending down more than $2 trillion in savings since the pandemic, they have turned to credit cards and other borrowing in recent months — a development now worrying some economists. Credit card debt has piled up at a historically fast clip — consumersadded$154 billion to their balances in the last quarter, the biggest leap over the previous year on record, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That debt has grown sharply more expensive as interest rates have climbed, with the average credit card interest raterisingfrom 16.3 percent two years ago to a record-high 20.7 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Borrowers, meanwhile, are falling further behind on making payments. Nearly 8 percent of total credit card debt is at least 30 days past due, the highest such figure since the Great Recession. Moody’s Analytics economist Justin Begley called the jump in credit card balances “concerning,” while noting that “the American household remains on pretty good financial footing generally speaking.” The delinquency rate should peak over the next year, as long as wage gains continue to outpace price increases and interest rates come down, allowing some borrowers to refinance their debt, Begley added. For now, though, Americans’ economic outlook remains dour. Consumer sentiment this month slid to its lowest level since May, according to the University of Michigan. Shoppers are focused on prices of necessities such as gas and food, rather than the slower pace of increases, and areworryingabout high interest rates and the effects of wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Other surveys back up those findings, with 81 percent of registered votersratingthe economy as either “fair” or “poor” and only 19 percent calling it “good” or “excellent” in a recent poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Newly cautious consumers will respond by slowing down their spending, though not halting it altogether, said Oxford Economics senior economist Bob Schwartz. “People like to vent in surveys, but it’s not necessarily how they behave,” Schwartz said. “I believe in not watching what people say but what they do.” Jaclyn Peiser contributed to this report.","November 18, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
231,Washington Post,"With Rosalynn’s passing, Jimmy Carter faces life alone",Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan and Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan,"When Rosalynn Carter was 90, she was wheeled into an operating room in an Atlanta hospital for major surgery. The surgeon warned Jimmy Carterthat his wife’s advanced age made the operation to remove a large part of her colon dangerous. It was 2018 and the former president, then 93, sat awake all night praying in the hospital. At dawn, after learning Rosalynn had survived, Jimmy dialed his grandson. “It was 6 a.m. He said he wanted to go home and spend the rest of his time with her,” Jason Carter recalled. “That was the moment he truly retired; he said no more executive meetings at the Carter Center. He just wanted to be with her.” Rosalynn was Jimmy’sdevoted partnerfor 77 years until shedied Sunday at age 96. They traveled the world together during and after his presidency. She was at his side when he entered hospice care at home nine months ago, and he was at her side after it was announced a few months later that she had dementia. Jimmy was with Rosalynn on Friday when she joined him in hospice care. With her passing, however, the former president is now without his Rosalynn for the first time since she was a teenager. A key focus of her life’s work was to honor those who help the sick and elderly. She often spoke about the emotional toll of caring for — and then surviving — a loved one. As their health declined over the years, Jimmy and Rosalynn were often each other’s caregivers. Until her final days, Rosalynn was still able to get around with the help of a walker. But she had been losing weight in the past week and was becoming increasingly frail, according to family members. “Time just caught up with her,” her niece, Kim Fuller, said Sunday after her death was announced. “She was getting more and more weak.” Rosalynn waslast seen in publictwo months ago at the annual Plains Peanut Festival in the Carters’ hometown, right before Jimmy’s 99th birthday, where she waved to the crowd while holding her husband’s hand from the back of an SUV driven by a Secret Service agent. Members of the Carter family said Rosalynn found comfort in being able to see from her front door in Plains the grassy slope where she and her husband planned to be laid to rest, side by side. “They were at peace with what was coming,” said Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who visited them in their home earlier this year. Rosalynn was the second-longest living first lady, after Bess Truman,the wife of Harry S. Truman, who lived to be 97. The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, which she founded in 1987, supports family members and others who take care of those unable to function alone. She calledcaregivers the backbone of the nation’s community health care system and said they too often went unrecognizedfor the vital work they do. Rosalynn was devastated when her father got leukemia and died when she was 13. Though young herself, she was the eldest child of four and so she sold eggs to help support the family. She also helped her mother, who needed to work, care for her younger brothers and sister. The former first lady often said that there are only four types of people: those who have been caregivers, those who are now caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregiving themselves. Anne Mahoney Robbins, a former White House aide to Rosalynn said she often saw her taking care of others, making the time to talk with them or offering a hug. “She said she had been lucky and she wanted to give others a break, too,” Mahoney Robbins said. For many years, Rosalynn championed childhood vaccinations against measles and other diseases. She traveled widely to discuss the importance of getting schoolchildren vaccinated. Rosalynn grew up in Plains, a town of only 700, and knew Jimmy as a child. After they married and he was running a peanut farm and warehouse, she was his bookkeeper. When he ran for elected office, she was regarded as his best campaigner and, according to their son Chip Carter, “she was definitely the better politician.” “She was a total partner to Jimmy in every way,” said Mahoney Robbins, who accompanied her on campaign trips during Jimmy’s successful 1976 presidential bid. Rosalynn took Jimmy’s defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and failure to win a second termfar harder than her husband did, the couple said in a 2018 interview with The Post. He said his need to cheer her up and find things to look forward to helped him get over the loss. “She really broke down,” Mahoney Robbins recalled. “She would say, ‘Why would the country do this to him?’” When they began their post-presidency charity work, Rosalynn focused on advocating for mental health and new ways to support caregivers. Rosalynn teamed up with Betty Ford, the first lady who preceded her in the White House. Ford, who publicized her own struggle with alcoholism, was a national advocate for better treatment for addictions. Gleaves Whitney, executive director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation, recalled Rosalynn coming to Michigan to speak at the Ford Museum. “She could be charming and witty, but above all she was a straight shooter,” he said. “And, before you talk to her, before you challenge her, make sure you have done your homework.” Rosalynn accompanied her husband’s many overseas trips, promoting human rights from Asia to Africa. In the 2018 Post interview, she recalled a most unusual trip to North Korea in 1994. No prior U.S. president had been to that country, which barred most foreigners. At the time, North Korea was threatening to build nuclear weapons. Jimmy’s mission was to get then-leader Kim Il-sung to allow international inspectors to monitor North Korea’s nuclear activity. Before the serious discussion — which did end in an agreement — the Carters and Kim took a cruise down a river. “We just talked about fishing,” said Rosalynn, who often went fly-fishing with her husband. When the high-stakes discussion started, she said she then became the official note taker. Asked about the secret to a happy marriage, she said to give your spouse some space but also not to miss out sharing hobbies and fun pastimes. At 59, for instance, she learned to ski so she could join Jimmy on the slopes. Even into her 90s, Rosalynn worked side by side with her husband on construction sites with Habitat for Humanity, building affordable homes for others. Since 2015, when Jimmy was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, the Carters seesawed back and forth about which one was the other’s caretaker. Against the odds, the former president recovered from the usually fatal cancer, and soon he was helping Rosalynn, who was becoming unsteady on her feet. Then in 2018, she was hospitalized. A large part of her colon was taken out because of enormous pain caused by scarring from a long-ago operation. Jimmy would bring her treats and rub her toes. “He actually was a very good nurse,” said Jill Stuckey, a family friend in Plains. But a series of falls since 2019 weakened Jimmy. By the end, their globe-trotting days over, the Carters spent their daysin their living room. They shared blueberries in the morning and watched “Law and Order” in the evening. Jimmy rested in his brown recliner and Rosalynn saton the end of their blue sofa, close enough to lay her hand on his. Their living room looks remarkably similar to what it looked like 1961, when they built it. There is little evidence that the Carters belonged to the rarefied world of America’s first families, other than a photo of the couple and their four children walking down Pennsylvania Avenue at Jimmy’s 1977 inauguration. Kim Fuller said the Carters remained each other’s caregiver, even when all they could do was hold the other’s hand. “They were never far from each other,” she said. “It’s hard to imagine one without the other,” said Stuckey, who saw them most days. In February, when Jimmy entered hospice, hesaid he would no longer go to the hospital for any treatment because he said the trips away were too hard on Rosalynn. He wanted them to be together. When Young visited them in their living room that month, the three old friends said a prayer together. Rosalynn was quiet. Jimmy just smiled. “They seemed so happy to be with each other,” he said. The latest:Rosalynn Carter, a close political and policy adviser to her husband, President Jimmy Carter,died Nov. 19. The Carters spent the final months of their time together at the family home in Plains, Ga. Theformer president decided in February to stop medical treatmentfor an aggressive form of melanoma skin cancer. The un-celebrity president:Jimmy Carter’s simple and modest lifestyle was rare, in sharp contrast to his successors.

232,Washington Post,"Nation mourns Rosalynn Carter, who helped redefine role of first lady",Anumita Kaur and Anumita Kaur,"Condolences poured in from across the nation for former first lady Rosalynn Carter,who died Sunday, with elected officials, other prominent figures and nonprofits praising her work to redefine the role of the first lady, her dedication to humanitarian causes and her service to the country. The Carter Center in Atlanta announced that she died at her home in Plains, Ga., two days after a statement that she had entered hospice care. She was 96. President Bidenand first lady Jill Biden acknowledged the news of Carter’s death as they opened a Thanksgiving event for service members and military families Sunday afternoon,just hours after news of Carter’s death became public. “I’m sorry that I have to lead this off with a sad announcement. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter has just passed, and she was well known for her efforts on mental health and caregiving and women’s rights,” Jill Biden said. After the event, the Bidens released an official statement, commending the former first lady for walking her own path and “inspiring a nation.” “Rosalynn did so much to address many of society’s greatest needs. She was a champion for equal rights and opportunities for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and wellness for every person; and a supporter of the often unseen and uncompensated caregivers of our children, aging loved ones, and people with disabilities,” the Bidensstated. Carter eschewed a ceremonial role as first lady, and instead served as a close political and policy adviser to her husband, former president Jimmy Carter. During her tenure, she created the modern Office of the First Lady, becoming the first in that role to maintain an office in the East Wing of the White House. “Rosalynn Carter was a great partner to a consequential President and helped to define the modern role of First Lady,” former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr.saidon social media. “She was gracious, warm — and determined.” Rosalynn Carter used the modernized first lady role to advocate for better treatment of the mentally ill, and was instrumental in securing congressional approval and funding for the Mental Health Systems Act in September 1980, the first major reform of federal mental health programs in nearly two decades,The Washington Post reported. She maintained her advocacy on mental health issues for decades after leaving the White House. Former president Bill Clinton called Carter “an unwavering voice for the overlooked and underrepresented” in astatementfrom himself and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. “Hillary and I are deeply grateful for her extraordinary service to our nation and world, and for more than forty years of friendship,” the Clintons stated. Former president George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush also expressed their condolences and praised Carter as “a woman of dignity and strength.” “There was no greater advocate of President Carter, and their partnership set a wonderful example of loyalty and fidelity. She leaves behind an important legacy,”the couple stated. Carter pushed forward a slate of issues while in the White House, includingfederal support for nationwide vaccine programsand laws to ensure children are vaccinated before kindergarten. Former first lady Michelle Obama reflected in a statement Sunday on how Carter impacted her personally. “You learn very quickly that there is no handbook or rules to being First Lady. Technically, it’s not even an official position,” Obamastatedon social media. “When our family was in the White House, every so often, Rosalynn would join me for lunch, offering a few words of advice and always — always — a helping hand. She reminded me to make the role of First Lady my own, just like she did.” Former first lady Melania Trumpstatedthat Carter “leaves behind a meaningful legacy not only as First Lady but as a wife and mother. We will always remember her servant’s heart and devotion to her husband, family, and country.” After the White House, the Carters went on to found the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization committed to human rights. Rosalynn Carter and her husband, who were together 77 years, are often remembered most for their work after they departed the White House in 1981. “Together, through their Carter Center and involvement in Habitat for Humanity, President and First Lady Carter have offered a beacon of light to every corner of the world,” said former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Their beautiful love and partnership was truly a wonder for all to behold. May it be a comfort to President Carter, their children Jack, Chip, Jeff and Amy, their many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and all of her loved ones that so many all over the globe are praying for them at this sad time.” Jason Carter, one of Carter’s grandchildren and a former Georgia state senator, said in a message to supporters of the Carter Center on Sunday that it is “one of the greatest legacies she leaves behind.” “She has been grateful for your support of her remarkable efforts to improve the welfare of people everywhere, whether by working to eradicate diseases, reducing the stigma of mental illnesses, or bringing peace to far corners of the world,” Jason Carter wrote. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit focused on civil rights, mourned Carter’s loss. “Her unwavering commitment to service and her tireless efforts by President Carter’s side left an indelible mark. Let us honor her memory by carrying forward her compassion and empathy,” the SPLCwroteon social media. Habitat for Humanityhonoredthe former first lady in a social mediapost— the Carters spent a week each year building homes for low-income people with the group. The couple built or remodeled more than 4,300 homes in 14 countries,The Post reported. Rosalynn Carter, who was born, raised and died in Plains, left a strong mark on the small city and across the state of Georgia as well. “It’s sad news. You expect it, but always hurts when you hear it,” said L. E. “Boze” Godwin III, the longtime mayor of Plains. “Rosalynn was integral, a big part of our community. She was a wonderful First Lady and a dear, sweet friend.” Mary Jordan, Joe Holley and Kevin Sullivan contributed to this report.","November 19, 2023 at 6:12 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
233,Washington Post,"Earth passed a feared global warming milestone Friday, at least briefly",Scott Dance and Scott Dance,"The planet marked an ominous milestone Friday: The first day global warmth crossed a threshold, if only briefly, that climate scientistshave warned could have calamitous consequences. Preliminary data show global temperatures averaged more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above a historic norm, from a time before humans started consuming fossil fuels and emitting planet-warminggreenhouse gases. That does not mean efforts to limitglobal warminghave failed — yet. Temperatures would have to surpass the 2-degree benchmark for months and years at a time before scientists consider it breached. But it’s a striking reminder that the climate is moving into uncharted territory. Friday marked the first time that everyday fluctuations around global temperature norms, which have been steadily increasing for decades, swung the planet beyond the dangerous threshold. It occurs after months ofrecord warmththat have stunned many scientists, defying some expectations of how quickly temperatures would accelerate this year. “I think while we should not read too much into a single day above 2C (or 1.5C for that matter) it’s a startling sign nonetheless of the level of extreme global temperatures we are experiencing in 2023,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist with Stripe and Berkeley Earth, said in a message to The Washington Post. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said Sunday on the social media platform X that Friday’s global temperatures were 1.17C (2.1F) above the 1991-2020 average, a record-setting margin. Given how much human-caused warming had occurred by that period, that means Friday’s average global temperature was 2.06C (3.7F) above a preindustrial reference period, 1850-1900, she said. Provisional ERA5 global temperature for 17th November from@Copernicus ECMWFwas 1.17°C above 1991-2020 - the warmest on record.Our best estimate is that this was the first day when global temperature was more than 2°C above 1850-1900 (or pre-industrial) levels, at 2.06°C.pic.twitter.com/j XF8o RZeip The estimate of global warmth comes from a European model that uses the same sorts of observations used in weather predictions to instead look backward, and estimate global climate conditions nearly in real time. Direct observations that scientists will gather and vet in the coming weeks could soon confirm the record warmth. That the globe surpassed the 2-degree warming benchmark for at least one day adds an exclamation point to a string of temperature records set in recent months. Global temperatures set records in July,August,Septemberand October. The Copernicus data shows that trend has been maintained, if not accelerated, into November. Even before Saturday, scientists said 2023 wasvirtually certain to surpass 2016 as the globe’s warmest on record, and likely to markone of its warmest periods in 125,000 years, going back to a time before Earth’s last ice age. That estimate is based onpaleoclimate recordsthat show there was at least no extended period of the sort of warmth the planet is now experiencing, and that temperatures are rising with unprecedented speed. Analyses released this month show 2023 average global temperatures are likely to end up1.3 to 1.4C (2.3 to 2.5F) above preindustrial levels. Climate scientists predict that sustained global warming at1.5 degreesabove preindustrial levelscould overwhelm societiesand upend economies and political systems. Planetary warming is only expected to accelerate in the coming monthsbecause of a deepening El Niño, the infamous climate pattern that drives weather extremes and raises global temperatures by releasing vast stores of heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere. But that surge of El Niño-fueled warmth typically does not arrive until after the climate pattern reaches its peak — something forecast to occur this winter. Because of that, scientists had said earlier this year they did not expect the globe to surge to such record warmth until 2024. Friday’s milestone offers yet more proof of how the planet hasdefied climate scientists’ expectationsthis year.","November 19, 2023 at 8:01 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
234,Washington Post,Commanders’ loss to lowly Giants leaves a stench,Nicki Jhabvala and Nicki Jhabvala,"Moments after a fan was carried out of the stands for throwing a beer can on the field, players returned to Fed Ex Field locker rooms that were without running water because of an “equipment failure” in the stadium’s main water heater. So the Washington Commanders were left to bask in the stench of their most embarrassing loss in years,a 31-19 drubbing Sunday from the New York Giants, owners of the worst offense in the NFL, led by third-string quarterback Tommy De Vito. Washington dropped to 4-7 and walked off the field to boos. The loss, undoubtedly the worst of Coach Ron Rivera’s tenure in Washington, was bad enough to raise the question of whetheran in-season change of some sort is near— not necessarily to salvage a season that continues to slip away but to acknowledge a sellout crowd of fans who expected more than this. Months after the Commanders enjoyeda wave of hopefollowing the sale of the franchise to a group led by Josh Harris, the team is now 12th in the NFC and has a minimal shot at a playoff appearance. “It’s a low point, that’s for sure,” Rivera said. Washington had no one to blame but itself. Svrluga: It doesn’t matter who coaches the Commanders now. It matters who’s next. The Commanders turned the ball over six times, with three interceptions by quarterback Sam Howell and a fumble apiece by tight end Logan Thomas, wide receiver Byron Pringle and running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The defense, meanwhile, was a sieve. A week after it allowed 11 explosive plays (defined as runs of 12 or more yards and passes of at least 16 yards) to the Seattle Seahawks, it gave up nine such plays to the Giants. In the first quarter, running back Saquon Barkley scored a 24-yard touchdown on a pass play with ease as linebacker Jamin Davis trailed in coverage. Barkley also took a pitch 36 yards in the third quarter after three missed tackles, added a five-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter and capped his night with a 31-yard run that set up a field goal. Wide receiver Darius Slayton, whose 24-yard catch in the first quarter set up Barkley’s first touchdown, also caught a 40-yard touchdown pass with nary a defender in sight in the second quarter, thanks to a blown coverage by the Commanders’ secondary. Tight end Daniel Bellinger received a similar gift when he found himself wide open for a 26-yard catch in the fourth quarter. De Vito connected with Barkley for his second touchdown of the day shortly after. “Their main plan seemed to be that they wanted to play man [coverage] and then let their D-line do what they do,” Giants wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins said of the Commanders. “They had some success with the sacks and stuff, but playing man in the NFL for an entire game isn’t easy, and we got guys who can make plays. So we started doing that, and I didn’t really notice a counter. They stuck with their plan.” Four takeaways from Sunday's loss to the Giants New York’s counter, Hodgins said, was to use a lot of the quick passing game to get the ball out of De Vito’s hands and turn Washington’s size on the back end into a liability. “Their reaction is just a bit slower, so we have a real advantage earlier in routes and plays because their bodies take longer to react to whatever they are seeing,” Hodgins added. “. . . They play a lot of man, so for us we do a lot of meshes, trying to get some picks and make their defenders pick themselves for our receivers. They were kind of struggling with the meshes [and we] started calling them even more.” The big-play trend continued for New York until the bitter end. Isaiah Simmons returned an interception 54 yards for the game-sealing score with 16 seconds remaining. Had the damage been limited to the explosive plays, perhaps Washington would have found a way to overcome them. But the Commanders beat themselves in other ways. Howell, whose development in his first season as a full-time starterhas sparked optimism, was sacked four times. His first interception was a slight overthrow to Dyami Brown. His second was a deep shot into double coverage. And his third, Simmons’s touchdown, was a failed attempt to throw away the ball. “[I] felt the pocket kind of collapse in on me, so I was just trying to get the ball out of bounds, and it just didn’t get far enough,” he said of the pass Simmons intercepted. Asked if he felt the game was regression for Howell, Rivera said it was “a step forward,” adding: “He’s learning; he’s growing. He made some mistakes, but he hung in there, he fought and gave us a chance to win the football game.” Three fumbles, two of which led to touchdowns for New York, didn’t help. “Just bad ball security on my behalf and the other guys who turned the ball over,” Thomas said. “We just got to be better at that. It’s something that we’ve been preaching. They did a good job breaking up the ball and getting the ball out.” Howell gave fans a scare when he was slow to get up after taking a hard hit from Xavier Mc Kinney after a seven-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter. Howell landed hard on his left side and lay on the ground awaiting trainers when many of his teammates rushed to him. A fight broke out on the sideline, leading to the disqualification of Commanders wide receiver Curtis Samuel and Giants defensive back Cor’Dale Flott. Howell returned to the field after a quick evaluation in the medical tent and insisted after the game that he was “all right” and that the hit had not affected his play the rest of the game. He finished 31 for 45 for 255 yards and a touchdown with a 62.7 passer rating. He also had three runs for 35 yards and a score. “I think the most frustrating part is that I think we have a really good football team,” Howell said. “We have so much potential in that locker room. That’s the disappointing thing — that we’re not getting the results that we feel like we were definitely capable of.” Ron Rivera says focus is on QB development, not his future For the better part of the past three years, Rivera has preached development and consistency as he has tried to turn around a franchise in turmoil. Although he has navigated an array of off-field issues, many of which involved the team’s former owner, the on-field product has had similar showings to Sunday’s. The Commanders have consistently failed to have all three phases — offense, defense and special teams — play well. They have consistently struggled to start fast and have consistently failed to clean up many of their nagging mistakes, including the big completions allowed on defense and the missed tackles that have led to big runs. They’ve also consistently fallen apart against teams they should’ve handily defeated. “It’s kind of been the theme of the season — we’ll play really good, and then we’ll have four- or five-minute lapses in a game that allow for big plays in the game,” said defensive tackle Jonathan Allen, who had 1.5 of his team’s nine sacks. “Until we clean that up, we’ll never be the defense that we can be.” Wanted: Game-changing plays from the Commanders’ DTs Rivera agreed, acknowledging the lack of steady play has stymied the team’s development. Asked whether he plans to make a change, Rivera offered only that “there are things we have to look at” and that the team will “continue to discuss it and go from there.” “No matter what my answer is, it’s going to come out and people are going to say it’s an excuse,” he added. “So we’re just going to take the responsibility. We’re going to show up tomorrow, we’re going to get prepared, and we’re going to get ready to play Dallas, because we got a very short week.” Tramel Raggs contributed to this report.","November 19, 2023 at 7:52 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
235,Washington Post,Jerry Jones says Jimmy Johnson is finally set for Cowboys’ Ring of Honor,Des Bieler and Des Bieler,"Jerry Jones said Sunday that it was “always going to happen,” but as the years went by, Jimmy Johnson had reason to wonder when he was ever going to be inducted into the Dallas Cowboys’ Ring of Honor. That day will finally come Dec. 30, during a game against the Detroit Lions, when the two-time Super Bowl-winning coach and co-architect of the Cowboys’ 1990s dynasty gets his due from a team owner who let Johnson depart on strained terms. “It feels right,” Jonessaidduring an impromptu news conference Sunday at Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium, where the visiting Cowboys trounced the Carolina Panthers, 33-10. “It feels rewarded by what it represents, all of the times that we had. There were traumatic times. I’m not trying to be overly dramatic, but nice little scars. Beautiful scars, 30 years ago, during that particular time. So appropriate that Jimmy Johnson should be recognized in this manner, by any definition you want to come up with.” “Let me just say this: how appreciative I am of Jerry and appreciative of the Ring of Honor, but more appreciative of him bringing me to the Cowboys in ’89,” Johnson said at the news conference. “The two of us were working around-the-clock together, and people don’t realize the relationship. Back then, Jerry and I talked every day. Every single day, I would be in his office. And we talked right here just recently. “We never really had a disagreement,” Johnson continued. “And that’s surprising to a lot of people, but we were always on the same page. And probably some of the tension happened there toward the end of my career, as far as with the Cowboys, because we were so busy going different directions that we didn’t talk as much. But my feeling of Jerry has never changed and, this may be strange, I love the guy. He is a big, big part — maybe the biggest part — of my entire career, and I’m very appreciative of that.” Since Johnson left Dallas after the 1993 season, when he helped the Cowboys win their second straight NFL title, 15 former members of the organization have been inducted into the Ring of Honor, including pass rusher De Marcus Ware, who was feted in October after having played for the Cowboys from 2005 to 2013. That group also featured standouts from the team’s run of success from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, such as running back Tony Dorsett, defensive lineman Randy White and personnel executives Tex Schramm and Gil Brandt. The winding, wonderful path of Vikings QB Joshua Dobbs Also among the 15 inductees were six players coached by Johnson, including the famed “Triplets” — quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith and wide receiver Michael Irvin — as well as defensive end Charles Haley, offensive lineman Larry Allen and safety Darren Woodson. However, the coach who set in motion such a dominant force that Dallas was able to win another Super Bowl under his less-acclaimed successor, Barry Switzer, was made to wait more than a decade. In the meantime, Johnson and Jones had occasionally sniped at each other, including in 2017, when the formersaid, “Jerry comes across as a rich a--hole.” When Jones, 81, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, he shared kind words for Johnson andsuggestedthat the ex-coach was firmly in the plans for a Ring of Honor ceremony. As recently as last year, though, Jones declared that he alone would decide when that happened and that it wouldn’t be “all tailored aroundwhether Jimmy is snivelingor not.” On Sunday, Jones struck a different tone,telling Johnson on the Fox pregame show, “It was magical, the time we had together.” When Jones erred in announcing that Johnson would go into the Cowboys’ Ring of Honor on “December the 30th of 1923,” the latter laughed and replied, “I hope it’s 2023.” Johnson, who went on to coach the Miami Dolphins and has long since worked as a studio analyst for Fox, also had a chuckle when a reporter at the news conference asked Jones why now was finally the time to make a long-awaited addition to the Ring of Honor. “One reason for this year,” the 80-year-old Johnson interjected, “is I’m alive.”","November 19, 2023 at 7:22 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
236,Washington Post,"Amid Gaza war, U.N. evacuates babies from besieged hospital",Louisa Loveluck and Sarah Dadouch and Louisa Loveluck and Sarah Dadouch,"JERUSALEM — The World Health Organization said Sunday that it had evacuated 31 premature infants from Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, bringing the newborns to a facility near the Egyptian border and signaling a broader effort to save the most vulnerable amid an Israeli siege of the sprawling medical complex. Officials in Israel, in making the case to storm al-Shifa, have described the hospital as the “beating heart” of the Hamasmilitant group’s operations, a claim for which they have yet to provide significant evidence. By the time a U.N. assessment team reached the hospital Saturday, the WHO said in astatement, the once-bustling facility resembled a “death zone.” Outside, the team found a grave filled with dozens of bodies. Inside, 25 terrified medics had stayed behind as Israeli troops closed in, swearing not to abandon the almost 300 patients who could not be moved safely. The list of injuries the U.N. team witnessed was an indicator of the brutality of an Israeli military campaign that has killed thousands of civilians in the pursuit of ending Hamas rule in Gaza. Among the most serious health conditions were amputations, burns, spinal injuries and chest and abdominal trauma. At least 11,100 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Oct. 7, when Israel launched its war in response to a Hamas attack that left 1,200 people dead. The militants also seized more than 200 Israeli and foreign hostages and took them to Gaza. On Sunday, the war’s impact again rippled across the region. In Yemen, Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized a vessel linked to an Israeli shipping magnate, with multiple nationalities on board. The Israeli military also said that 10 mortar shells were launched from Lebanon toward Israel, adding to fears of a creeping escalation between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. U.S. close to deal with Israel and Hamas to pause conflict, free some hostages But even as regional tensions flared, Israel is hopeful that it can get a “significant” number of hostages freed from Gaza in the next few days, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog, said Sunday. The deal, which is being brokered by Qatar, is meant to include a pause in the fighting, in return for the hostages. The United States has pushed Israel to allow about 100 trucks of humanitarian assistance into Gaza daily as civilians endure a food crisis so dire that the World Food Program has warned that starvation is a possibility. But aid groups say supplies entering by truck are still a drop in the ocean compared to the need. In southern Gaza, waves of displaced people from the north have overwhelmed hospitals, shelters and residential areas, placing strain on already meager resources. Vast tent camps have sprung up in the south, where heavy rain in recent days has worsened the misery. In northern Gaza, where Israel has focused its ground offensive, doctors last week had already run out of anesthetic and painkillers for operations. A power outage at al-Shifa forced medics to remove 39 babies from their incubators. To keep the infants warm, staff placed them close together and wrapped them in aluminum foil and medical scrubs. Thirty-one infants survived the wait for evacuation, two of them dying the night before a U.N. team reached them, the WHO said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general,said Sundaythat 31 “very sick” babies had been evacuated to southern Gaza in ambulances operated by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. The mission took place under “extremely intense and high-risk security conditions,” Tedros said, adding that his organization was expected to evacuate more patients in the coming days. Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said that the babies would be taken to Egypt on Monday and that their parents would be asked to go to the Tal al-Sultan Hospital in the southern city of Rafah to arrange permission to leave with their children. It was unclear how the mothers would be notified, or whether they would be able to make the trip. Fuel shortages and war damage have disrupted Gaza’s communications network, and humanitarian groups say that the route out of Gaza City, where an unknown number of civiliansare trapped or too scared to leave, is full of danger. Doctors Without Borders said Sunday that a staff member’s relative was killed and another wounded after Israeli forces fired “deliberately” on a convoy carrying 140 of the organization’s employees and their family members the day before. The convoy was clearly marked,saidthe organization also known by its French acronym MSF, and both warring parties were notified of its passage. “It was not crossfire,” Michel O. Lacharité, the head of MSF’s emergencies desk, said Sunday. “It was targeted. Our MSF vehicles are clearly marked with a big logo — MSF — on the hood, on the rooftop, on the doors.” Sunday night, they were again sheltering on MSF premises near al-Shifa, without food or water, Lacharité said. The ill-fated convoy had set out as more than 2,500 people sheltering at al-Shifa also evacuated after Israeli troops gave them one hour to depart, health officials said. Exhausted and bedraggled, many of them walked the 15 miles to Khan Younis in the south. Israeli aircraft recently dropped leaflets near the city urging residents to move once again, as military leaders signaled the offensive would soon expand beyond the north. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Saturday that his forces were shrinking the space for Hamas operations “with every passing day.” “People who are in the southern Gaza Strip will understand that soon as well,” he said. But a ground assault in the south would put hundreds of thousands of civilians in the crossfire, and many of them are already displaced and have nowhere to go. Israeli strikes and intense urban combat have laid waste to much of northern Gaza, and it remained unclear whether Israel would allow civilians to return. The Biden administration is increasingly uncomfortable with the loss of life in Gaza, and on Sunday, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer warned that there was “real concern” civilians could be adversely affected without careful planning for operations in the south. Israel has the right to pursue Hamas militants in southern Gaza, Finer said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” but added: “Their operations should not go forward until those people — those additional civilians — have been accounted for in their military planning.” “And so we will be conveying that directly to them and have been conveying that directly to them,” he said. The Israeli army’s internal calculations over its threshold for civilian casualties, which are not made public,appear higher than in previous operations, according to legal experts, as military planners frame the fight against Hamas as existential. International law requires militaries to make clear distinctions between civilians and combatants and to take all possible steps to prevent civilian harm. In practice, Israeli strikes have hit water towers and bakeries, schools and ambulances. Human rights groups have flagged more strikes as potential war crimes and pressed for international investigation. There is growing anger among the families of the Israeli and foreign hostages in Gaza over the Israeli government’s failure to secure their release. Some have been horrified by the intensity of the bombing, fearing that it will affect their loved ones, too; others have described the military operation as a necessary response to the mass killing in October and the kidnappings. The Washington Post reported Saturday that the parties were nearing a deal that could lead to the release of dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting, according to people familiar with the terms. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said Sunday that the sticking points to the deal, which is also intended to allow aid into the besieged enclave, are largely logistical. In a news conference, Thani said efforts to reach a deal have had “ups and downs” in recent weeks but that he was “now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal that can bring the people safely back to their homes.” The challenges that remain “are very minor,” he said, adding that “efforts are ongoing.” Dadouch reported from Beirut.

240,Washington Post,"Vulgarities, insults, baseless attacks: Trump backers follow his lead",Hannah Knowles and Hannah Knowles,"DES MOINES —Donald Trumpwas conspicuously absent at a conservative Christian forum here, where his long-shot rivals for the Republican presidential nomination were asked how they could be role models from the White House. The host brought up Trump’s insulting nicknames: “How do we raise the bar?” he asked. The next day, Trump swooped into Iowa for his own event — where he lobbed insults, made crude references and casually tossed out baseless and false claims designed to belittle his opponents and critics in vicious terms. Children wandered around in shirts and hats with the letters “FJB,” an abbreviation for an obscene jab at President Bidenthat other merchandise spelled out: “F--- Biden.” During his speech inside a high school gym in Fort Dodge, former president Trump called one GOP rival a “son of a b----,” referred to another as “birdbrain” and had the crowd shrieking with laughter at his comments on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who he called “pencil neck” before asking, “How does he hold up that fat, ugly face?” He brought the house down while mocking Biden, at one point baselessly suggesting Biden is using drugs and can’t get offstage “by the time whatever it is he’s taken wears off.” One of Trump’s introductory speakers from the Iowa state legislature declared anyone who kneels for the national anthem is a “disrespectful little s---,” quickly drawing a roaring response. And outside the packed venue, vulgar slogans about Biden and Vice President Harris were splashed across T-shirts: “Biden Loves Minors.” “Joe and the Ho Gotta Go!” One referred to Biden and Harris performing sexual acts. Trump’s coarseness and cruelty have come to define the Republican Party since his rise to the presidency — and many GOP voters relish and emulate the approach, while others tolerate it. The split-screen on display in Iowa on Friday and Saturday highlighted one of the defining dynamics in the Republican race, in which Trump is the dominant polling leader overshadowing a roster of candidates running more traditional campaigns. Offered the chance to support other presidential hopefuls who champion similar agenda to Trump in a less abrasive package, Republicans are for now sticking with the former president — underscoring how his personality and shattering of behavioral norms have long been a major part of his appeal. Conservative evangelicals influential in Iowa — the first state in the GOP nominating calendar — have previously set aside some distaste for Trump’s personal behavior as he took up their causes, including appointing antiabortion judges to the Supreme Court, and next year’s caucuses will test whether anything has shifted. Trump’s rhetoric has alienated voters across the political spectrum and made him a particularly galvanizing opponent for Democrats. Within the GOP, however, it has spread, with others down the ballot and even some of his rivals looking to replicate his shock tactics. Saturday afternoon’s event in Fort Dodge served as a stark illustration of the crudeness, meanness and unfounded accusations that he has helped normalize in politics. T-shirts on sale at the event neatly summed up that appeal with images of Trump giving a middle finger. “Even my dog hates Biden!” one of the merchants yelled each time someone walked up to look. The substance and tone of Trump’s event was typical for a candidate who shot to political power with shocking pronouncements, insulting tweets and breaches of basic etiquette that, to supporters, were proof of his pitch as an outsider rather than a standard politician. He gained a political following pushing false claims that the country’s first Black president was born in Africa, denigrated migrants from certain countries, gave cutting nicknames to his rivals and enemies and won despite arecordingin which he bragged in crass terms about groping women. At one point Saturday, Trump responded at length to lurid unsubstantiated claims about his sexual activity that were included in a dossier penned by former British spy Christopher Steele in 2016, saying his wife Melania immediately dismissed them as false because she knows he is a germaphobe. Anticipating another general election matchup with Biden, Trump is criticizing Biden’s policies but also attacking him in highly personal terms as weak or “stupid.” On Saturday he suggested Biden is unimposing to the dictators Trump often compliments, saying Chinese President Xi Jinping, who recently met with Biden, is “strong like granite” and musing that Taliban leaders might not call Biden “your excellency,” as Trump says they once addressed him. “Everything Donald Trump says is either projection or a reflection of his deep insecurities. The American people elected Joe Biden in 2020 and rejected the hateful, divisive extremism of Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and they’ll do it again next November,” said Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa. Campaigning for president again, Trump’s rhetoric has only escalated. Last weekend he likened his political enemies to“vermin,”drawing a backlash as historians noted that dictators including Adolf Hitler used similar language. On the trail, he regularly assails the prosecutors investigating him with more nicknames (“Letitia Peekaboo James,” whichrhymeswith a racist slur) and labels like “animal.” On special counsel Jack Smith: “You take a look at that face, you say, that guy is a sick man.” “President Trump is a role model,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in response to criticisms of the former president’s rhetoric. “He’s showing how to completely dominate a primary and general election.” Trump’s language has rubbed off on his supporters. “Joe’s gotta go,” said Lori Carpenter, 59,as she left the Fort Dodge event.“And the ho shouldn’t have been there in the first place.” The “ho” was Harris, she clarified, before offering another nickname for Harris that was even more vulgar. “It doesn’t bother me,” she said of Trump’s insults and crudeness. Her relative, 71-year-old Marsha Crouthamel, agreed. “It doesn’t bother me either because his policies are strong,” she echoed, adding that Trump got a lot of laughs and added, “Sometimes you just gotta excite people a little bit.” “We’re Christians, and we can look past that,” Carpenter said. “We see the good that he did our country when he was in.” Asked what she thought of GOP rivals arguing they could deliver Trump-like policies without the baggage, she said: “They’re weaker than him.” Many Republicans were never fans of Trump’s personal style, even as they embraced his policies. Others who were once drawn to Trump are expressing more doubts about his drama and in particular his willingness to bash fellow conservatives — and Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination are hoping to tap into that. Some of them haveincreasinglysuggested to voters that the former president’s behavior is a problem. “You need to have the better angels of our nature guide us when you’re exercising his type of leadership,” Florida Gov.Ron De Santissaid Friday at the forumin Des Moines hosted by the Family Leader, an Iowa-based evangelical group. “The president has the ability, using the bully pulpit, to lift people up. We need that in this country.” The whole event was designed as a display of political civility, with three usually-combative GOP candidates assembled together at a table decorated for Thanksgiving. De Santis got some of the night’s strongest applause when he laid out his case against Trump, and on Saturday, he criticized the former president’s “disrespect for Iowa conservatives” in aposton X, noting Trump’s attacks on Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. But even Trump’s opponents have often declined to denounce his most outrageous comments and in many ways echo his style. De Santis has vowed to “startslitting throats”in the federal bureaucracy.Nikki Haleyhas seized attention with her put-downs of rival Vivek Ramaswamyin the debates. (“You’re just scum.”) And Ramaswamy has repeatedly come to Trump’s defense. Trump is the overwhelming favorite to win the GOP nomination with less than two months until the voting starts. Warming up the crowd for him in Fort Dodge, Iowa state Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink (R) channeled Trump-world’s message for Republicans put off by Trump’s personality — the kind of voter better-represented at the Family Leader forum. Republicans looking to move on from Trump often tell Trump supporters, “We need a fresh start … I wish he’d stop saying bad things about people,” Kraayenbrink told the audience. “You know what my answer is to them?” He laughed. “If that’s what you believe, the fake news, the Democrats, the RINOs, and the establishment — you’re buying everything they’ve been selling you for the last seven years.” While Trump’s audiences love his attacks on Biden, they are usually impassive when he turns to De Santis, his favorite punching bag in the GOP primary. Trump on Saturday repeatedly referred to De Santis as “De Sanctimonious” or just “De Sanctus” and went on a long, mocking tangent about how De Santis once sought his endorsement in a tough race for Florida governor. Trump also briefly bashed rising rival Haley and called her “birdbrain,” an insult he debuted this fall. Some Trump supporters wish he would ease up on fellow Republicans. But many also brush it off as “Trump being Trump,” or politicians doing what politicians do — attack each other. “Politics is politics,” said Matthew Stringer, 26, another attendee, when asked about Trump’s comments on Schiff and others. “Is there better terms for it? Probably. But you know, honestly, he’s admitted that he’s no holy man. And neither is anybody else.” Trump paused for a moment to note that some Republicans want him to dial things back, reenacting suggestions to pull back on De Santis. “They said, ‘sir, please don’t hit him so hard.’ Why? ‘He’s a Republican.’ Who the hell cares!?” The crowd laughed loudly in surprise. Some started to clap. As for Biden, Trump claimed he used to hold back a bit “out of respect for the office of the presidency.” “But now you can say it,” he added.

241,Washington Post,A stranger asked me to take her photograph. It saved my life.,,"The day I decided to die, I watched the sun disappear into the San Francisco Bay. As the orange ripples spread through the water, I made my way to a subway station, sat on a blue steel bench and waited for the eastbound train to Oakland. I’d been drinking whiskey mixed with flat Coke all afternoon to work up the nerve to jump in front of the train, and I was drunk enough that my plan felt within reach. I was 23. Two months earlier, my mother had tried to take her life, and I had interrupted her attempt. This experience, compounded by years of depression and addiction, made me long to stop feeling. It’s not that I wanted to die, exactly, it’s that I didn’t want to live. I stood, and took a few steps toward the platform’s edge. The incoming train screeched. A gust of air blew up my sleeves. “Excuse me,” said a voice to my right, “but would you mind taking my picture?” I turned toward the voice. A wiry woman with pink hair and a titanium lip ring stood a few feet away from me, smiling and offering her phone. Her nails were painted silver. She couldn’t have been older than nineteen. “I literally just arrived in San Francisco,” she said. “And I’m so excited to be here.” It didn’t occur to me that I could have said no, that I was busy, that I had to catch a train. I nodded and took her phone. She skipped toward the blue steel bench where I’d been sitting, stood on it, flashed a peace sign, and grinned. I took a few pictures. For the next ten seconds my attention was glued to her poses. By the time our interaction was over, the train I was going to jump in front of had slowed into the station, and I’d missed my chance. I could have stayed and waited for another train, but the interruption had thrown me off just enough to lose my nerve. A teen died. Now his friends visit his grandma for breakfast each week. I left the station and walked uphill until I reached a park. Below me, clusters of people gathered on the grass, playing the guitar, drinking wine. I sat down, lit a cigarette and stared at the dark water behind San Francisco’s glittering skyline. I pulled out my phone and took a picture of ahusky’s backlit silhouette. My hands shook so hard the image blurred. Seven years have passed since the day I almost jumped in front of the train, and I know a lot more about suicide now than I did at 23. The process of gathering data and information has helped me understand what almost happened to me. The child of a parent who has attempted suicide is almostfive times more likelyto become suicidal than the child of a parent with no history of self-harm. People with an alcohol use disorderare up to 120 times more likelyto attempt suicide than those who are not dependent on alcohol. Roughlyone in four peoplewho complete suicide are intoxicated. (My mother and I were both drunk during our close calls.) What this means is that the completion of suicide often occurs when ideation, opportunity and a lack of interruption converge into a single unretractable moment. He had debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. Here’s how he dealt with it. Today, my mother is alive because I found her. Today, I am alive because a pink-haired stranger stopped me for a picture. I call this woman my “interrupter.” Interrupters exist everywhere — there’s a man who hasseized more than 400 people off the railingsof the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China. There’s aretired police officerwho has walked more than 600 people back from the ledges of the Tojinbo cliffs in Japan. And then there are accidental interrupters — the people who approach desolate strangers in subway stations. Sometimes I wonder whether my interrupter saw my suffering rise from my body like steam. But even if the interruption was a coincidence, she saved me that night and gave me a tool that continues to save me to this day. As I write this, I am in recovery, sober and in therapy. The combination of these factors has curbed my suicidal impulses, but I still have days when my despair threatens to burn through me like a wildfire. On these days, I take myself outside and ask strangers whether they’d like me to take their picture. I tend to approach folks who are already in the process of photographing one another — couples, friends, families, people takingselfies. I also approach people who look sad, lonely, lost in thought. Often, I don’t have to say anything: I’ll hold up my hands and curl my right indexfinger as if I am pressing the button on an invisible camera, and they’ll hand me their phones with a smile. To date, no one has turned me down. Thanks to this practice, I have a catalogue of sweet snapshots embedded in my memory: the teenage couple sitting on a bench enveloped in yellow daisies in a garden in Mendocino, a group of women with purple feather boas wrapped around their necks in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, a pair of redheaded friends sipping iced chai on a wooden bench in a tiny town in Northern California, a man standing in front of a weeping willow, arms outstretched like wings. I will never see these photos or these people ever again. And if I did, I probably wouldn’t recognize them — nor would they remember me. Our entire relationship lives and dies in the amount of time required to take a picture. My temporal existence collides with their temporary experience to create a frozen frame that will outlive us all — a sliver of visual proof that says “we were here, smiling.” Then, we go our separate ways — I leave them with a tangible reminder that our paths crossed, briefly, even if they forget about me. And they leave me with a jolt of connection that interrupts my hopelessness and makes me feel that being alive matters, just a little bit. Sometimes I close my eyes and try to recall the picture I took of my interrupter, seven years ago: how she stood on the blue bench in the subway station, how her pink hair stuck out in every direction, the way her grin was so wide it looked like it might fall off her face.

242,Washington Post,Voters must take Trump seriously and literally. The stakes are that high.,Dan Balz and Dan Balz,"The headline in the latest issue of the Economistmagazine does not mince words: “Donald Trump poses the biggest danger to the world in 2024.” The alarm is twofold. First, that the former president could win the election next November; and second, what he might do if that happens. Presidential elections are often about many things. In 2024, the economy will be a factor for most voters. For many, immigration will be another.Abortion, too, will continue to be a motivator. President Biden’s record certainly will be a consideration, as will the incumbent’s age and perceptions of his capacity to lead the nation for another four years, until he is 86. But the Economist puts the focus where it needs to be, which is on the former president — what he did during his first term, including what he did to help provoke the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, and, most important, how much farther out he has gone rhetorically and substantively since then to preview what a second term might portend. The Economist summed up why a Trump victory in 2024 could be materially different from his first in 2016. “A second Trump term would be a watershed in a way the first was not,” the editors wrote. “Victory would confirm his most destructive instincts about power. His plans would encounter less resistance. And because America will have voted him in while knowing the worst, its moral authority would decline.” Trump has spoken openly about a second term as a time of retribution, when he would weaponize the Justice Department to go after his opponents. The Washington Postrecently reportedthat he has identified individuals he would target for investigation, including a number who served in his administration. Among those cited in the article were former White House chief of staff John Kelly, former attorney general William P. Barr and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark A. Milley. He has also talked about going after Biden and his family. Seven years ago, the journalist Salena Zito, after listening to many voters in what became Trump country,coined an expressionthat later seemed to sum up why there was shock and surprise in many establishment quarters when he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016: “The press takes him literally, but not seriously,” she wrote. “His supporters take him seriously, but not literally.” Trump and allies plot revenge, Justice Department control in a second term How literally to take everything Trump says is a good question. He is a performance artist who lives in the moment. He knows how to shock and provoke his adversaries — and he includes the press among those adversaries. Does he mean what he says? Another question is how much attention should be paid to him. Should every wild statement be splashed on the homepages of traditional media websites and commented upon endlessly on cable roundtables? Or should they be mostly ignored as just another effort to attract attention? Neither of those questions has a simple answer. But to the other half of the Zito formulation, there is no comparison, or at least should not be, between 2016 and 2024. Taking Trump seriously, as the Economist does in its new issue, is a requirement — for the press, certainly, but also for all Americans who care about the future. Trump has a devoted following, and a good portion of it is intensely loyal. These supporters hang on his words, even if they don’t take them literally, and they follow him wherever he goes politically.A new pollby The Washington Post and Monmouth University of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire underscores not only the lead Trump has over his rivals for the party’s nomination but also the degree to which his supporters are fixed on his side. Subscribe to The Trump Trials, our weekly email newsletter on Donald Trump's four criminal cases Trump leads the GOP field in New Hampshire with 46 percent support and his challengers far behind. Among his supporters, 80 percent say they will definitely vote for him in the Jan. 23 primary. Among all potential primary voters, 41 percent say they would be enthusiastic if he becomes the nominee, double or more the enthusiasm for any of his rivals. When Monmouth asked that question in 2016, 26 percent said they would be enthusiastic about him leading their ticket that fall. A majority of these potential primary voters (55 percent) say Biden won the 2020 election “due to voter fraud,” and among that group, 72 percent are backing Trump. Among those election deniers, none of Trump’s rivals is in double digits. That’s one more marker of how Trump’s lies have infected the party and a worrisome indication that those voters would likely approve of whatever direction he might move in the future. At this point, there is little drama about the outcome of the Republican nomination contest. While that could change, a focus on Trump as the likely nominee is well justified. Attention can be paid to rivals like former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, Florida Gov.Ron De Santisand, because he could be a force in New Hampshire, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. But that is not the only or even principal focus of attention in a campaign year that is unlike either of Trump’s previous campaigns. Treating Trump as the likely nominee means ever more attention can be focused on who he is, who he has become, and who he might be if elected again. The Post reported in May about “thedeepening radicalization” of Trump. The article noted that his positions “have become even more extreme; his tone more confrontational.” In recent days, both The Post and the New York Timeshave published stories about what policies and actions Trump might pursue in a second term, from using the Justice Department to go after enemies to a broad immigration crackdown to purges in the executive branch. The two leaders of Trump’s reelection campaign — Susie Wiles and Chris La Civita — sent out a statement this past Monday attempting to distance the former president from the substance of such stories. The statement noted that some of the reporting is based on work being done by think tanks, which are friendly to Trump, and others not directly associated with the campaign, though the stories also are based on things Trump has already said. “These reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical,” they wrote. “Any personnel lists, policy agendas, or government plans published elsewhere are merely suggestions.” That they felt it necessary to issue such a statement might simply be that Trump doesn’t like others to speak for him. But it also highlights the degree to which they must recognize that greater focus on possible radical policies being discussed means greater possible damage to Trump’s chances of winning a second term. Whatever his campaign advisers say in a statement, Trump himself is not running away from some of what was written about a possible second term. In aninterview on Univisiona few days after The Post story said Trump might use the Justice Department to go after opponents, the former president confirmed that yes, he might well do that if he gets back into office. Latino backlash grows over Donald Trump’s friendly Univision interview The former president and the current president are headed toward what could be a very close election. Polling in the states that will decide who wins an electoral college majority now gives Trump a slight edge. These polls should be read with caution, given that they are a year out, that most voters have not fully keyed into the general election and that events over the next nine to 12 months are impossible to predict. With Trump facing four criminal indictments involving 91 felony counts, the campaign could be as much courtroom drama as rallies and ads. How will voters process a conviction if that were to occur? Trump’s rhetoric has become more extreme; it is language associated with authoritarian leaders of the past. The latest and most provocative came during a Veterans Day speech in New Hampshire, when he said this: “We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections.” Those words quickly echoed across the country and beyond, reported by news organizations and replayed again and again on cable television. Should what he said be taken neither literally nor seriously, or has a Rubicon been crossed that, with an upcoming election, requires that he be takenbothliterally and seriously?","November 18, 2023 at 1:55 p.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
243,Washington Post,Latino backlash grows over Donald Trump’s friendly Univision interview,Michael Scherer and Michael Scherer,"The nation’s largest Spanish-language media company, Univision, faced growing backlash Friday forits handling of a recent interview with former president Donald Trump, as major Latino advocacy groups delivered a letter of protest to the network’s executives and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus prepared to request a meeting with the network. Actor and comedian John Leguizamo, who recently took a turn as host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” also posted a video on Instagram on Thursday night calling for a boycott of the network until it stopped its rejection of Biden ads, some of which were canceled just before the Trump interview aired. “I am asking all my brothers and sisters who are actors, artists, politicians, activists to not go on Univision,” he said in a message in English and Spanish. The pushback comes after a Nov. 7 interview with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida that was arranged with the help of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and attended by a trio of senior executives at Univision’s parent company. Theinterview was notable for its gracious tone, lack of follow-up questions and Trump’s assertion in the first minutes about owners of the network. “They like me,” Trump said. It’s a sharp contrast to the long history of tension between Trump and Univision — a fact that alarmed both Democrats and journalists inside Univision. The network, which has said it has also requested an interview with President Biden, announced a new policy of preventing opposition advertising during single-candidate interviews shortly before the Trump interview aired. The network also canceled a booking with a Biden spokeswoman to respond to the interview on a subsequent news broadcast. A top anchor at Univision in Miami, León Krauze, who helmed the late-night newscast, announced he had abruptly separated from the network Wednesday, less than a week after the interview aired. Neither Krauze nor the network offered a reason for the separation in their statements about the split. Joaquin Blaya, a former president of Univision who created its signature news show in the late 1980s, told The Washington Post in an interview this week that he worried the network had moved away from its founding mission. “I am not surprised that someone who is a serious journalist like León Krauze would not be the kind of journalist that they want there,” Blaya said. “They are different times. It is not good what is happening there.” Blaya — who hired the network’s most famous anchor, Jorge Ramos — later ran Telemundo, the other major Spanish-language network in the United States. He said the Trump interview this month was a step back for Univision towards a journalistic approach he associated with some major broadcasters in Mexico. The Mexican media company Grupo Televisa, which has long had a close relationship with political power brokers in that country, recently merged with the owners of Univision to take joint control of the company. “This was Mexican-style news coverage, a repudiation of the concept of separation of business and news,” Blaya said of the Trump interview. “What I saw there was batting practice, someone dropping balls for him to hit out of the park. I think it was an embarrassment.” Wade Davis, one of the Televisa Univision executives who attended the Mar-a-Lago meeting, sent a note to U.S. staff this week addressing the controversy caused by the Trump interview. “Our goal is to cover candidates from all political parties — Democrats, Republicans and Independents — and to assure Hispanics of the most comprehensive access to information that will help them make educated decisions at the ballot box,” Davis wrote. “Our mission is to make Latinos a vital part of our electoral process by encouraging them to register and exercising their constitutional right to vote.” More than 70 groups — including major Latino rights organizations Unidos US Action, America’s Voice and MALDEF — sent a letter Friday night to Davis and two other Televisa Univision executives who attended the meeting with Trump that described the interview as “a betrayal of trust.” “We demand Univision conduct a thorough internal review, take corrective measures, and reaffirm its commitment to unbiased reporting and to keeping the Latino community informed and up-to-date with facts and truth,” the letter reads. “Unfiltered, unaddressed and unrestricted disinformation does a disservice to all communities in the U.S. and will destroy Univision’s reputation as a credible network that informs an important electorate.” The Hispanic Federation, a network of Latino groups, has also separately requested a meeting with Univision executives to discuss their concerns about the Trump interview, according to a spokesperson for the group. The all-Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucushas also drafted a letter, which is likely to be sent to Univision in the coming days, asking Davis to meet with members of Congress about the journalistic standards of the network, according to a congressional staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the effort. The draft letter, which was shared with The Post, describes a congressional interest in addressing misinformation and disinformation in the Latino community. Isaac Lee — the chief news officer at Univision during the 2016 campaign when the network clashed with Trump — said he had confidence that the journalists at Univision in Miami would cover the coming presidential race properly. The Trump interview had been conducted by a Mexico City-based anchor for Televisa, Enrique Acevedo, who previously worked in the United States for Univision. “I don’t think that one interview with Enrique can determine how the campaign is going to be covered and how Latinos are going to get their information,” Lee said. “And from the people I know at Univision News, and I know all of them, I trust that their heart and their mind is in the right place.” Catch up onthe winners and losersandtakeaways from the third Republican primary debate.

244,Washington Post,Haley says she would sign six-week abortion ban if still S.C. governor,Hannah Knowles and Hannah Knowles,"DES MOINES — Pressed onabortionat a Christian conservative gathering, GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haleysaid Friday that she would sign a six-week abortion ban in her home state of South Carolina if she were still governor. Haley has tried to strike a more nuancedtone on abortion than some of her fellow Republican hopefuls by calling for legislators to seek areas of “consensus” at the federal level. She has also said that while she opposes abortion, she “doesn’t judge anyone for being pro-choice.” At the same time, she has previously said she would support any restriction on the procedure that can pass while sidestepping calls for a particular limit. At a forum on Friday for 2024 candidates hosted by evangelical organization the Family Leader, Haley was asked to be more specific about which types of laws she supports. The fine line she has tried to walk has drawn approval from some Republicans and independents wary of abortion restrictions — or just eager to move on from the divisive issue. But it’s also brought criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, with some antiabortion activists skeptical of her answers and Democrats attacking Haley as extreme despite her talk of compromise. “Nikki Haley is no moderate — she’s an anti-abortion MAGA extremist who wants to rip away women’s freedoms just like she did when she was South Carolina governor,” Ammar Moussa, the director of rapid response for President Biden’s reelection campaign, said in a statement. The former U.N. ambassador has gained steam in the 2024 race in recent months, showing particular momentum in New Hampshire, an early nominating state where many Republicans support abortion access. But she and other candidates also face pressure from the party’s social conservatives to back restrictions — especially in Iowa, the first state in the GOP nominating process. Haley’s latest comments further muddle the GOP candidates’ differences on abortion. Former president Donald Trumphas been harshly critical of six-week bans — even though he worked to overturn Roe v. Wadeby remaking the Supreme Courtand touts that achievement to conservative voters. Haley has appealed to voters uncomfortable with abortion restrictions, but her latest comments put her to the right of Trump in some respects — and in line with her rival Gov.Ron De Santis, who faced blowback from some top supporters for signing a six-week ban in Florida. Trump, the dominant polling leader here in Iowa and in other early states, is scheduled to campaign in the state on Saturday. He has largely avoided multicandidate events, including televised debates. At Friday’s forum — attended by Haley, De Santis and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy— Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats noted that Trump has criticized the six-week bans he helped enable. “If you were governor of South Carolina and that came to your desk, would you sign a heartbeat bill?” Vander Plaats asked Haley, referring to the point roughly six weeks into a pregnancy when early embryonic heart activitymight be detected. “Yes,” Haley said. “Whatever the people decide.” A six-week ban took effect in South Carolina this summer after the state Supreme Court upheld it. Republicans still struggle to find a winning strategy on abortion Earlier this year, asked if she would sign a six-week abortion ban as president, Haley deflected,telling CNN’s Jake Tapper, “I will answer that when you ask Kamala [Harris] and Biden if they would agree to 37 weeks, 38 weeks, 39 weeks. Then I’ll answer your question.” Vander Plaats on Friday told the candidates assembled for the forum that “it’s only fair to address what I believe is your highest hurdle, from what I’m hearing.” Then he pushed Haley to explain her attention-grabbing answers on abortion during the GOP debates. “I had some pro-lifers say, that sounded like a pro-choice answer,” Vander Plaats said. “Can you assure them why that’s not a pro-choice answer?” Haley cited her support for antiabortion measures when she was governor of South Carolina, before the Supreme Court ended a nationwide, constitutional right to abortion. She helped pass a20-week abortion banthere and supported mandatory waiting periods and ultrasound tests before the procedure. Then she reiterated her message on consensus from the debates.“I’m trying to bring more people to us to have the conversation of how do we save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible,” Haley told the hundreds who turned out for the Family Leader’s forum at the Des Moines Marriott Downtown. Earlier Friday, she picked up anotable endorsementfrom an Iowa antiabortion leader. Marlys Popma, former president of Iowa Right to Life,declaredat one of Haley’s town halls that she had walked in undecided but was now ready to back Haley. De Santis, who will speak at an antiabortion Christmas gala on Saturday, is centering his campaign in Iowa and appealing heavily to evangelical voters such as the ones who turned out for Friday’s forum. He’s rebuked Trump for criticizing six-week bans. But even he often sidesteps questions about national restrictions, suggesting it’s better handled at the state level. Vander Plaats emphasized on Friday, however, that he hopes to see a Republican president advance national restrictions. The Thanksgiving forum was designed to get candidates to open up beyond their usual stump speeches, with Vander Plaats gathering three candidates normally at loggerheads around a table for conversation. De Santis, Haley and Ramaswamy were cordial throughout the nearly two-hour-long chat – even as they touched on policy issues where they are at odds. They also got personal – often sharing family stories, including on the topic of pregnancy and abortion. Haley reiterated details she often shares about her struggle to get pregnant and her college roommate who was raped. And both De Santis and Ramaswamy disclosed that their wives had miscarried. De Santis brought it up after Vander Plaats asked the candidates how the country could “make family central” and promote households with “a mom and a dad.” Recounting the “blessing” of building his own family, De Santis said that he and his wife, Casey De Santis, struggled at first to have a child. They traveled to Israel when De Santis was a congressman, visited holy sites and prayed for a baby, he said. “We got back to the United States, and a little time later, we got pregnant,” De Santis said. “But unfortunately, we lost that first baby, and you know, it was a tough thing, because this is something that we had so much hopes for, so much aspirations … we just kept the faith.” Ramaswamy recounted his and his wife’s excitement when she first got pregnant. “We lost our first child,” he said. “And that was the loss of a life.”","November 17, 2023 at 11:31 p.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
245,Washington Post,Hunter Biden’s career of benefiting from his father’s name,Matt Viser and Matt Viser,"Hunter Biden worked for years to cultivate high-level relationships in China, flying to the country with his father on Air Force Two and serving as a board member of a Chinese investment firm. As he did, he understood the new relationships he was building did not come from his charm alone. “It has nothing to do with me,” he wrote in 2011 about some of his developing connections with Chinese investors, “and everything to do with my last name.” The blunt acknowledgment, in an email to his close friend and business associate Devon Archer, was a recognition of the built-in advantages the younger Biden had as he grew his Washington-based business. When he was building a new consulting firm during his father’s vice presidency, he — and particularly his partners — showed little hesitancy in using a coveted last name to open doors that could provide financial opportunity. Inside Hunter Biden's deals with a Chinese energy company At times they would hand out books autographed by Joe Biden, emails and interviews show. They would provide vice-presidential cuff links or challenge coins to friends, associates or prospective clients. They secured tickets to White House events, including dinners, holiday parties and the annual Easter Egg Roll, at times strategizing over which business associates should receive them. House Republicans have launched an impeachment inquiry attempting to show that Joe Biden improperly benefited from his son’s work or used his office to assist the younger Biden, and havesubpoenaed Hunter and his uncle James Biden to testify next month. But they have not produced any direct evidence, and their own witnesses at one hearing said the impeachment threshold had not been met. Momentum behind impeachment inquiry slows A Washington Post review of Hunter Biden’s career found no sign the family patriarch was an active participant in his son’s business efforts. But interviews with former Hunter Biden associates, along with information drawn from congressional testimony and a review of emails found ona copy of Hunter’s purported laptop that have been authenticated by The Post, illustrate how the president’s son and his partners benefited from his last name. There is also limited evidence that the now-president asked his son to be careful or expressed qualms about how Hunter was wielding the name he made famous. Hunter Biden’s legal team referred to past statements that he and his lawyers have made, including from his current lawyer Abbe Lowell, who has said that “Hunter Biden did not involve his father in, nor did his father assist him in, his business” and that “it’s been five years of investigations into Hunter Biden and his legitimate business activities, and still Republicans have nothing to show for it.” The White House declined to comment. Over the years, Hunter’s relationship with his own last name has been complex and even tortured. He has been proud of it, relied on it, benefited from it. But it has also invited burdens and scrutiny. And while his business life has been closely bound up with his father’s world, he has at times been protective of the Biden name and shied away from taking advantage too directly. “We would come to him with ideas, and he would say all the time, ‘No, we’re not doing that. That’s too close to the edge,’” said one former business partner, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about private conversations. “He would say constantly, ‘The Biden brand is not mine to f--- up.’” For the second presidential election in a row, Hunter is expected to be a focus of the campaign. The president’s son has faced a multiyear criminal investigation, resulting incharges related to a gun purchaseand more charges potentially to come on tax issues. These developments put Hunter’s business deals under renewed scrutiny and shine a spotlight on a business strategy that, as Archer recently testified, revolved around a central pillar: leveraging the Biden brand. At first Hunter, after graduating from Yale Law School in 1996, pursued a relatively traditional career for an up-and-coming Washington lawyer. He worked as a senior vice president at MBNA America. He joined the U.S. Commerce Department to focus on e-commerce policy. He was appointed to the board of Amtrak. He was a registered lobbyist and a founding partner of Oldaker, Biden and Belair. By 2008, Hunter’s firm was thriving. He was sober, he had a $1.6 million home in Washington, and his three daughters were enrolled at Sidwell Friends School. In his telling, all of that was abruptly derailed when Barack Obama chose Joe Biden as his running mate and imposed strict lobbying restrictions on family members. “Then,” Hunter wrote in his memoir, “Dad joined the Obama ticket, and I had to find new work. Some Obama advisors vehemently opposed my lobbying and made it clear it would have to end.” He scrambled to start a consulting firm to advise small and midsize companies on domestic and international expansions. He named it Seneca Global Advisors, after one of the Finger Lakes near his late mother’s hometown. He soon partnered with Archer and Chris Heinz, former senator John F. Kerry’s stepson, to form a new firm called Rosemont Seneca (Heinz did not respond to a request for comment). Hunter would steer clients toward lobbyists if needed, according to business partners and emails, but he himself sought to avoid directly lobbying federal agencies or officials. Instead, he used relationships forged over a politically active life the way other people with famous names have done — to bring in business, give advice, make connections. “The stuff he was doing was completely normal,” said one former business associate, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid controversy. “A lot of it was him trying to find a new line of work but leveraging what he knew well, which was people and his network.” But attracting clients to his new venture proved daunting. Hunter, by then in his mid-40s, at times seemed out of his depth, according to those close to him. He described it as “riding the escalator without an exit.” “What people get wrong about him is assuming he had a plan,” said another person familiar with his business, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide a candid assessment. “He was a fish out of water trying to figure out how to do anything outside of D.C. He grew up around politics and was very, very familiar inside D.C. — but doing anything outside is foreign to him.” Archer, a friend of Heinz’s from Yale, saw potential in the Biden brand. “Devon immediately was like, ‘Oh man, that last name could help’ — and off they went,” the person said. Archer declined to comment, and his attorney pointed tocongressional testimonyhis client provided earlier this year. “Devon Archer shared the truth with Congress when he met with them in July, and if called upon to do so again, he will answer all of the questions put to him truthfully,” Matthew L. Schwartz, Archer’s attorney, said in a statement. “Mr. Archer has always cooperated with all investigations of the Biden family, and he leaves it to the investigators as to what, if anything, they should do.” As Hunter grew his business, he often sought to give potential clients the impression that he could get things done because of his connections, but he avoided promising any particular actions by his father, one of the former associates said. “If there is anything here, it’s an abuse of soft power,” the person said. With his father ensconced as vice president, Hunter and his business partners scoured the globe for business opportunities. They looked at oil in Kazakhstan in 2014, signed an engagement with a Romanian firm in 2015, and sought deals with wealthy Mexican business executives in 2016, according to business partners and emails. Hunter also entered into business deals in China, and took a seat on the board of Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. That position came at a time when Joe Biden was the face of the Obama administration’s efforts to crack down on corruption in Ukraine — a push that Republicans later argued without evidencemay have benefited his son. It did showcase, however, the ways in which Hunter pursued business abroad at a time whenhis father was serving as a globe-trotting statesman, overlapping in ways that worried Biden advisers about a perceived conflict of interest. As Hunter prospected for clients, there were times when he looked for ways that his father’s travel could intersect with his own, The Post review of emails shows. When one of his associates, Eric Schwerin, emailed a news story on Nov, 12, 2015, about the vice president planning a visit to Croatia for a summit with southern European leaders, Hunter responded, “Let’s see if it makes any sense for me to do some of my own stuff on the down low.” Schwerin wrote back, “I am quietly checking to find out which other leaders are attending.” Schwerin did not respond to several messages seeking comment. Hunter was often seen by people close to his father — and those who wanted to be — as an important conduit to his tightknit family. “Here’s my direct email,” future California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote to him in June 2014 from a private Gmail address. (Newsom declined to comment.) When Joe Biden had breakfast with then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg in New York in 2010 and golfed with him in Washington in 2012, Hunter was invited. (A spokesman for Bloomberg declined to comment.) When Jack Markell, then governor of Delaware, attempted to secure a meeting between Joe Biden and a group of Chinese business executives considering an investment in Delaware, Markell tried to enlist Hunter’s help in reaching his vice-presidential father. But Hunter, appearing a bit baffled, was not sure he could assist. “I don’t know how to handle — JRB is not going to meet with 4 Chinese Nationals — at least I don’t think he will,” Hunter wrote, using his father’s initials in an email to Dennis Toner, a longtime former aide to Joe Biden. “And clearly they can’t be at a [fundraiser] with him. What do you suggest?” Markell the next day asked Hunter if his father could at least write a letter apologizing for being unable to meet with the business executives. “If that doesn’t work, perhaps a letter from Hunter referring to his dad or something … i think you get the point,” he added. Toner said he did not recall any conversations about the email. Markell, who is the U.S. ambassador to Italy and San Marino, said he did not remember the exchange or any letter materializing. Of an engagement with the vice president, he said, “I’m confident no such meeting took place.” It was not unusual for Hunter to travel abroad with his father, giving him access to high-level officials, although former associates say he reimbursed the government for the flights. Early in his father’s vice presidency, Hunter made a point of emphasizing certain ethical lines. He admonished some of his White House guests that they were not to discuss business on-site. He rejected some business deals, saying they overlapped too closely with his father’s activities. “My concern is that my Dad is point person for administration on Russia — I want to make sure there is no conflict here,” he wrote to one of his business partners in 2011. Several times, Hunter was asked to help set up meetings or contact a senator on someone’s behalf, but he demurred because he feared it would constitute lobbying, which he was prohibited from doing. “Do people with influential fathers get things done? All day long. That’s how it works,” one of his former business associates said. “Hunter knew that there were lines that could be crossed and he wasn’t willing to cross them.” Hunter even expressed frustration in 2014 when Jim Messina, Obama’s former campaign manager, began doing private work that Hunter viewed as benefiting from his connection with Obama’s political operation. Messina had formed a consulting firm, which Hunter argued was bolstered by his political connections, and Hunter railed against the effort in an email to some of his father’s advisers as well as his brother. “Can anyone explain?” he asked. The efforts by Messina, who declined to comment, seemed particularly to grate on Hunter because Obama’s ethics rules had forced him to alter his own work. “Isn’t this a huge slap in the face of every Obama donor and volunteer who built OFA for the exact purpose of ending this ‘revolving door’ bullsh--,” Hunter wrote, referring to Organizing For America, Obama’s grass-roots operation. “How is this story not titled Obama campaign manager and former WH assistant to the President sells out on everything this Administration supposedly stood for?” But over time, it appears that Hunter shed some of his caution. That was evident in 2014 and 2015, when his brother Beau, suffering from a brain tumor, got sicker and eventually died. Hunter had long wrestled with addiction, and his brother’s cancer sent him into his biggest spiral yet, according to former associates as well as Hunter’s memoir. Some of Hunter’s associates believe his addiction drove him to drop some of the ethical restraint he had exercised when his father first became vice president. “When Hunter fell off the wagon, all the wheels came off,” one former business associate said. Others suggested his addiction prompted a need for more funds. “You see a guy who is desperate for money because of those issues, and a dad very much trying to keep him on track, but who from every single interaction I had with them was never going to mix any of that stuff or help Hunter with business partners,” another former business associate said. Still, the person acknowledged that, from Hunter’s end, “There was certainly a bunch of stupid emails and texts” as he grew more desperate. He joined the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company, in the spring of 2014, despite warnings from some Biden advisers about a potential conflict since his father was Obama’s point man on Ukraine. “I hope you know what you’re doing,” Joe Biden told his son at the time, according tointerviews he, as wellas his son, later gavein one of the only known instances in which his father questioned his business pursuits. Hunter responded by telling his father that he did. Hunter also attempted to gain the favor of some of the wealthiest and most influential business executives in Mexico, a country where he saw tantalizing business opportunities, including as a potential site for Burisma to expand its oil and gas exploration. A Biden family friend, Jeff Cooper, was meanwhile pursuing online gambling operations throughout South America. He and Hunter joined forces to connect with several Mexican business executives and, at least twice, Hunter secured meetings between some of those business executives and his father. In early 2014, at Hunter’s request, a vice-presidential photographer sent images of a meeting in Biden’s office that included Joe, Hunter, Cooper and two Mexican business executives, Miguel Alemán Velasco — whose father was president of Mexico from 1946 to 1952 — and his son, Miguel Alemán Magnani, who ran the Mexican budget airline Interjet. Nearly two years later, in November 2015, Hunter set up a breakfast at the Naval Observatory with the same group, along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Slim, as well as Alemán Velasco and Alemán Magnani, did not respond to requests for comment, and Cooper declined to comment. One person familiar with the encounters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the meetings were not substantive. “It was way more, ‘My friends are in town. Is it all right if we come up for breakfast?’” the person said. “It was, ‘Yeah, of course.’” The vice president seemed to welcome the chance to speak with Slim, who had built one of the largest telecom companies in the world and was a major shareholder of the New York Times Co. Hunter, for his part, was able to show off his proximity to his father to his prospective business partners. In early 2016, Hunter and Cooper joined the vice president on Air Force Two for a trip to an economic summit in Mexico City. It was the setting for one of Hunter’s most volatile eruptions, and one of his clearest demands for a favor from someone he’d cultivated. Hunter emailed Alemán Magnani, asking him to bring his dad, the son of the former Mexican president, to greet them when Air Force Two landed, and he was angry that Alemán Magnani was ignoring him. They had been talking about business deals and partnerships for seven years, Hunter wrote, and yet “I haven’t heard from you since I got you a mtg for Carlos and your Dad.” “I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F’ing White House and the Vice President’s house and the inauguration and then you go completely silent — I don’t hear from you for months,” Hunter wrote in an email sent on the afternoon of Feb. 24, 2016, hours before they were to arrive in Mexico. “I don’t know what it is that I did but I’d like to know why I’ve delivered on every single thing you’ve ever asked — and you make me feel like I’ve done something to offend you.” Alemán Magnani did not show up at the airport, but he and Hunter met for dinner in Mexico. The vice president’s son spent much of that dinner berating the Mexican business executive to the point where Alemán Magnani excused himself to go to the bathroom and never returned, according to a person familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private event. In the end, any dealings with Alemán Magnani seemed to fall apart, in part due to Hunter’s erratic behavior, the person said, and the younger Biden never did any business in Mexico. Archer testified recently before Congress that Hunter’s approach was to sell the illusion, rather than the reality, of access to his father. The two Bidens would speak on a daily basis, and at times Hunter would put his father on speakerphone in the middle of business meetings. They were in a restaurant in Paris with executives from a French energy company, Archer testified, when Hunter put his father on speakerphone. Archer recalled another instance in China, meeting with a business executive, when something similar happened. Altogether, he estimated, he heard Hunter speak with his father on about 20 occasions while in business meetings. “It was, you know, just general niceties and, you know, conversation in general,” Archer said. “You know, about the geography, about the weather, whatever it may be.” Archer said he knew of no instance when Joe Biden took official action on Hunter’s behalf. “At the end of the day, part of what was delivered is the brand,” Archer said. “That’s what we’re talking about, is that there was brand being delivered, along with other capabilities and reach.” “Obviously,” he added later, “the brand carried.” Lowell, Hunter’s lawyer, has emphasized that the phone calls were routine and did not reflect any engagement in Hunter’s business. “It’s well known that Hunter and his father speak daily,” he said in response to Archer’s testimony in late July. “And what Mr. Archer confirmed today was that when those calls occurred during Hunter’s business meetings, if there was any interaction between his father and his business associates, it was simply to exchange small talk.” Another Hunter Biden business partner, Rob Walker, provided a description similar to Archer’s. In an interview with FBI and IRS agents, Walker said the younger Biden was “real careful about not crossing any sort of lines.” But he also recounted a business lunch between Hunter and a group of Chinese business executives at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington in 2017. Joe Biden, who was then out of office, stopped by. “He literally [just] sat down — I don’t even think he drank water,” Walker said, according to a transcript of the interview released by House Republicans. “I think Hunter said, ‘Um, I may be trying to start a company, ah, or tried to do something with these guys and could you …,’ and I think he was like, ‘If I’m around,’ and he’d show up.” The FBI agent asked: “So you definitely got the feeling that that was orchestrated by Hunter to have, like, an appearance by his dad at that meeting just to kind of bolster your chances at making a deal work out?” “Sure,” Walker replied. Walker did not return messages seeking comment. Walker was among the recipients of a May 2017 email that has been repeatedly cited by Republicans suggesting that a prospective deal with Chinese executives would include 10 percent set aside for Joe Biden, referred to in the email as “the big guy.” Walker testified that the author of the email, James Gilliar, included that notion as a bit of “wishful thinking.” He added, “It looks terrible, but it’s not. I certainly never was thinking at any time that the VP was a part of anything we were doing.” Gilliar did not respond to a request for comment, but in 2020 told the Wall Street Journal that “I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president.” Hunter and his uncle James Biden separately signed an agreement with the business executives, who represented a Chinese energy conglomerate called CEFC, and over the course of 14 months CEFC and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities James and Hunter controlled.In a review of that arrangement, The Post did not find evidence that Joe Biden personally benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC, which took place after he had left the vice presidency and before he announced his intention to seek the White House in 2020. More broadly, Hunter’s legal team has denied Republican charges that Joe Biden was involved in his son’s business deals, or that Hunter did anything improper in them. “There is not a single financial transaction between President Biden and his son related to or involving any of Hunter Biden’s business ventures or prior private commercial dealings,” they wrote in a recent memo. “Hunter Biden’s business transactions were legitimate and well-documented in written agreements, and transactions legally tracked in his businesses’ bank statements.” House Republicans have searched for ways to show that Joe Biden benefited from his son’s business dealings, but have so far largely come up empty. They recently targeted one of Joe Biden’s private email addresses, asking the National Archives to provide messages from an account in which Biden used the alias “Robin Ware.” In response to a separate lawsuit seeking similar emails from the account,the Archives recently said it had identifiedapproximately 82,000 pages of potentially responsive documents. A small slice of those emails between Joe and Hunter Biden were authenticated by The Post, and they deal far more with personal matters than business deals. Joe Biden would forward news articles, send photos or remark about how tall a granddaughter had grown. He passed along messages to his children about their ancestors, or about how many miles he’d flown as vice president. “Just leaving Ankara going to Istanbul. 4:45 pm here,” he wrote in a brief message from Turkey in 2011. “Miss you guys. Love Dad” Mostly the emails convey the elder Biden’s concern for Hunter, shining a light on the delicate line he has tried walking in pursuing a highflying political career while dealing with a troubled son. In July 2011, he wrote an email whose message was contained entirely in the subject line: “We are lucky fathers Love Dad” “I’ve loved and admired your loyalty and fearlessness, even when I tried to chastise you,” Biden wrote to his son on Nov. 24, 2012. He wrote that “from the time you were a child you’ve had extraordinary courage.” He quoted Hunter’s grandmother, who in his telling often said, “Courage is the foundation block for character and character is destiny.” The then-vice president recalled a moment when Hunter jumped into a crowd to defend his father when a “frat boy” yelled at him after Joe Biden dropped out of the 1988 presidential campaign. “I hoped I would have done the same for my dads honor,” Biden wrote. “You are my son blood of my blood bone of my bone.” In a similar message, with the subject line “My beautiful son,” he wrote, “You’ve been a man since you were a child.” By early 2019, Joe Biden was beginning to plan his presidential campaign. Hunter’s foreign business deals had largely faded. His lucrative partnership with Chinese energy executives had dissolved, and he would soon resign his Burisma position. He was in the depths of addiction, by his own later account, and many of his business relationships had collapsed. Archer had been facing criminal charges in a case that did not involve Hunter, and, by March 2019, Archer was depressed and a little bitter. “Why did your dad’s administration appointees arrest me and try to put me in jail? Just curious,” Archer asked in a text message, in an exchange found on a copy of Hunter’s hard drive and verified by a person familiar with it. “Why would they try and ruin my family and destroy my kids and no one from your family’s side step in and at least try to help me. I don’t get it.” Archer declined to comment on the exchange. “Buddy are you serious,” Hunter responded, going on to explain the role of an independent Justice Department and the need for checks and balances. “It’s democracy. Three co equal branches of government,” he wrote. “You are always more vulnerable to the overreach of one of those Co equal branches when you are in power.” In a message that predated his own legal problems, he wrote of the obligations of those in power. “Every presidents family is held to a higher standard [and] is a target. It’s the price of being the most powerful group of people in the world,” Hunter wrote. “It’s why our democracy remains viable. It’s unfair at times but in the end the system of justice usually works and like you we are redeemed and the truth prevails. The unfairness to us allows for the greater good.” His family always sticks together in dark moments, he said — “That’s the way Bidens are different and you are a Biden” — but Hunter, himself in a low place, also urged Archer not to blame him the way that others in his life had done. “I’m somehow the source of all their disappointments. I’m beginning to believe all of them,” Hunter wrote. “And we aren’t a banana republic buddy. The powerful are targets in this country the more powerful they become. But the truth prevails if you have the stamina and guts and enough love to stay the course.”","November 18, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
246,Washington Post,"Congress averted a government shutdown, but the real fiscal fight is ahead",Marianna Sotomayor and Marianna Sotomayor,"During his weekly news conference with reporters,House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) made clear that hisdecision to fund the governmentwith a stopgap planwas not an abandonment of his far-right bona fides, but simplerecognition that a partisan proposal would never become law. “I’m one of the arch conservatives, okay? And I want to cut spending right now. … But when we have a three-vote majority — because we do right now — we don’t have the votes to be able to advance that,” Johnson said in response to the House Freedom Caucus public rebukes of his proposal. “... We are not surrendering, we’re fighting. But you have to be wise about choosing the fights. You’ve got to fight fights that you can win.” Johnson’s pursuit ofcompromise only further inflamed the far right, who believed that House Republicans missed their chance to use Friday’s funding deadline as leverageto extract concessions from the Senate. Their ultimatums have left them dug in during an era where politicians prize partisan wins over bipartisanship, especially among the fractious GOP conference who already ousted a speaker for relying on Democrats to pass legislation. While two Republican House speakers have now successfully proposed bipartisan plans that avoided agovernment shutdownthis year, it has come at the expenseof delaying the inevitable fight to fund the government for the full 2024 fiscal year. Setting those 2024 spending levelswill require consensus between the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate before the next fiscal deadlines, teeing up what many expect to be an even more contentious battle that willcenter on Johnson’s ability to lead his deeply divided conference. The House and Senate remain billions of dollarsapart on their respectiveappropriation bills that would fund all government departments until Sept. 30, with both chambers failing to mark up their proposals to the $1.59 trillion in spending enshrined into law by House Republicans and President Bidenin exchange forraising the debt ceilingearlier this year. But while appropriators and governing-minded lawmakers in both parties believe they can strike compromise and avoid an automatic1 percent cutacross all federal departments early next year, far-right hard-liners have suggested rejecting any compromise that does not fulfill their spending requests and have flirted with the idea of supporting a government shutdown if the Senate does not accept their demands. “We’re not going to shut the government down,” said House Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry (R-Pa.). “If the Senate chooses to do that because we send something over to them that is reasonable, the American people can understand, that actually gets our funding toward a trajectory that doesn’t bankrupt America, that’s going to be on them, not us.” When they return from the Thanksgiving break,House Republicans hope to continue passing full-year funding bills, of which five of 12 remain. But they acknowledge that intraparty differences will make the process incredibly difficult. Republicans believe three of the five remaining bills may be able to pass once changes are made, but proposals funding the Agriculture Department — usually the least controversial bill — and Labor and Health and Human Services are riddled with provisions that vulnerable Republicans representing swing districts could never support. Foreshadowing the expected fight ahead, 14 members of the Freedom Caucus and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) put Johnson on notice this week by reverting back to an old tactic that previouslyhelped extract concessionsfrom leadership. These Republicans sunk a procedural hurdle to consider a full-year funding bill that the group has been demanding a vote on all year — a scheme Freedom Caucus members agreed to deploy against Johnson’s decisions as “a shot across the bow … in good faith,” as Perry described the move. Johnson’sstopgap funding planhad married the Freedom Caucus’s never-tested proposal to split up funding deadlineswith centrists’ demand to extend current fiscal levels until the new year without spending cuts or additional asks that would delay the funding process. The bill, which was signed into law by Biden on Friday morning, funds some departments until mid-January and the rest through early February. Though Johnson’s plan avoided a government shutdown — which he stressed was the goal in various private meetings with lawmakers — it angeredhard-liners, who saw it as another missed opportunity to fight for what the MAGA base wanted whileamplifying their belief that Republicans’ inability to keep campaign promises willcompromise their ability to expand the majority in 2024. “This is not why Republican voters send Republicans to Washington,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) said after successfully tanking consideration of a Justice Department funding bill. “The speaker now has 10 days to work it out and get Republicans to actually stand up and fight when we get back. He’s promising a fight. So we’re sending a message right now. We expect that fight when we get back from Thanksgiving.” Congress returns in late November with hopes of alsofulfilling Biden’s request for supplemental aid to foreign democracies in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific. But withwaning support among Republicansfor more Ukraine aid, both chambers must alsostrike a deal on border security— which Biden has also asked for — to compensate. During that time, appropriators also hope to begin negotiations on how to fund the government in 2024. House GOP appropriators told Johnson earlier this month that they need clarity on a top-line number since the Senate set its funding levels above the $1.59 trillion enshrined in thedebt ceilingdeal. House Republicans were forced to make drastic cuts to meet a $1.41 trillion fundingdemand by the far-right flank after they sank a procedural hurdle in retribution to then-Speaker Kevin Mc Carthy’s (R-Calif.) debt deal and froze the House from considering legislative business for a week. In a meeting with the four top party leaders of the House and Senate, Johnson relayed appropriators’message to his counterparts that they needed to affirm whether the $1.59 trillion top-line is what both chambers will adhere to with the White House, according to three people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. This week, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the four House and Senate leaders as well as appropriations committee bosses have been negotiating a top-line number as the January and February deadlines fast approach. “It should be in conference right now, but until there’s an agreement among all the leaders on a top line, it’s very hard to conference any bill,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Unlike the House, the Senate has marked up its 12 appropriations bills to befar closerto the $1.59 trillion in total spending that Mc Carthy and others agreed to in the Fiscal Responsibility Act debt ceiling deal. As a rank-and-file member,Johnson voted for those caps, but Republicans have since ignoredthe deal and instead pushed appropriations bills with steep cuts and partisan riders targeting hot-button issues including LGBTQ+ and abortion-related policies. “That is the path forward,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said about the need to adhere to levels set in the debt ceiling deal. “The Senate agrees on that path. The Biden administration agrees on that path. House Democrats agree on that path. There are many House Republicans who agree on that path, and it’s time for action.” Democrats believe that Republicans do not have much leverage when it comes to pushing for their version of appropriations bills, given the conference is struggling to pass them through the House with Republican votes only. “They’ll have to figure that out for sure,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), No. 2 in Senate Republican leadership, of House Republicans’ inability to pass many of their own appropriations bills. Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) echoed the sentiment, saying: “It’s pretty hard for us to say, ‘We need to negotiate with the Senate,’ when we can’t get our own appropriation bills off the floor.” With more than 30 membersin its ranks, the Freedom Caucus is large enough to determine whether bills make it onto the House floor, which is why GOP leaders havechosento suspend the rulesand approve stopgap funding bills with Democratic support. Many pragmatic Republicans privately mused that the House may have to continue operating that way since the Freedom Caucus will probably never be appeased with a compromise to spend less next year but not enough to their liking. But an isolated far-right flank is exactly what previous Republican speakers have tried to avoid to keep the majority united, albeit unsuccessfully. The Freedom Caucus taunted Speakers John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) enough that they left before a motion to remove them from the post was filed. Unlike his predecessors, Mc Carthy embraced the far-right flank but ultimately became the first speaker removed by his own conference after working with Democrats — a similar route Johnson has since taken. Though irritated, many hard-liners complimented Johnson personally as a genuine and honest leader, which they say is enough to prevent him from being ousted. But theyalso put him on notice. “The new speaker is respected. He’s admired. He’s trusted. You know, he’s human. He’s imperfect, like we all are,” said Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), a Freedom Caucus member who supported ousting Mc Carthy. “But then the conference needs to support the speaker in the negotiations with the Senate and we cannot fear a government shutdown, above all else. What we’ve got to fear is exacerbating our debt situation, which is the greatest fiscal crisis the country has ever faced.” Members of the Freedom Caucus have lambasted their Republican colleagues for not being as aggressive in their desireto cut spending in an effort to reduce the federal deficit. Good accused his colleagues of being “courage challenged.” Perry accused appropriators of “holding the process hostage.” And Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) called for a government shutdown as maximum leverage to reduce fiscal spending, “which nobody is willing to do here.” “I can honestly say that if I were in a district that hinges on reelection, I’d say that, you know, take my reelect. Do it,” Norman said in rebuke of vulnerable Republicans who have voted against steep cuts because they negatively affect their district. The openness to shutting down the government is exactly what worries pragmatic Republicans. House Republicans have largely remained united throughout the year by sending the Senate legislation that advances their agenda, at times bending to far-right demands to project unity and enter negotiations with the most conservative foot forward. But many also recognize that doing so requires hard-liners to soften their demands since the White House and Senate remain in Democratic control. “Republicans have a choice. We can work together to get conservative victories, or we can bicker, squabble, take hostages and lose,” Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said about the path forward. “Some of my colleagues, I don’t get the sense that they’ve been a part of very many successful teams.” Moderate Republicans are over-projecting a sense of unity, especially ahead of a tough election year. In a meeting with centrist members of the Republican Governance Group, lawmakers began discussing voting to block consideration of bills that are too extreme for their districts in ways that the Freedom Caucus has normalized. In the group’s first meeting with Johnson last week, membersmade clear to the speakerthat the days of them being a reliable party vote for the sake of unity was over. While Freedom Caucus members largely contributed to sinking the rule that would have allowed for debate on funding the Justice Department and other government entities and freezing some Iranian funds, four vulnerable New York Republicans also voted against it, citing significant cuts to police funding. “I think you’re going to see more of that,” said Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), who chairs the Republican Governance Group. “There’s no reason to continue down this path of, ‘We’re all team players,’ because they’re not. So we might as well fight against this.” The push for cuts and the consequences of such drastic spending is exactly why the fiscal fight has steadily defined the fractious House Republican conference. Republicans across the ideological spectrum acknowledged that the difficulty to meet their goal of passing a dozen appropriation bills has taught them two lessons ahead of next year’s appropriation season that begins in earnest after Biden releases his budget early next year: set a top-line number to fund the government early and stay in session for more weeks in an effort to pass all appropriation bills on time. Those tasked with appropriating the trillions of dollars that keep the government functioning believe top leaders in the House and Senate — known as the “Four Corners” — can fund the government for a full year. But they acknowledge that doing so will require ignoring hard-liners’ demands since they have realized the people in the group, as loud as they are in forcing their demands be met, have a decade-long track record of rejecting the final product. “It’s been a good exercise,” said Joyce, a moderate appropriator who has worked to incorporate the far right’s spending asks. “But I think if anything in these last couple of weeks has shown us, it’s that at the end of the day, what we talked about at the beginning of the year, [the far right is] not going to be there. So why spend all this time trying to prioritize things that they want? Lord knows I did.” Liz Goodwin and Paul Kane contributed to this report.

247,Washington Post,"Lawmakers bracing for many congressional retirements, even from younger members",Paul Kane and Paul Kane,"Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) just had, arguably, the most productive two years of his 14 terms in the House. Rep. Michael C. Burgess (Tex.) is now the second-most-senior Republican on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee. Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) just got appointed vice chair of an investigative subcommittee. Yet all three lawmakers decided in the last couple of weeks that they would rather retire than keep advancing up the ladders of power. Voting with their feet, they are declaring that the glamour of serving under the Capitol dome is much more hype than actual reality. Political performance art — illustrated bythe recent senatorial threat to fight a committee witnessand two colleaguesclashing over accusations one elbowed the other— has left more studious legislators politically depressed. Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), asked about those silly incidents of near fights, got much more serious. “Silliness? Hmm, unconstitutional impeachments and censures that don’t make any sense,” Buck told reporters, citing actions that he opposed from his far-right colleagues. Incapable of disguising his disgust at the state of the GOP in recent weeks, Buck surprised almost no one when he announced on Nov. 1 that he will not seek reelection next year. “The big driver was we can’t admit that Republicans lost an election in 2020, which is crazy,” he told reporters. Even Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Tex.) briefly called it quits, just three years after winning his first congressional race. On Monday, he filed papers to run for his old seat in the state Senate, wherehe had “the best two years”of his political life. He changed his mind on Tuesday,after some agonizing with his family,and decided to run again for the House. Shutdown prep is exhausting Washington. At least the bartenders are happy. It’s important to note, however, at this moment there is no evidence that the number of retiring lawmakers is out of the ordinary. So far 29 members of the House, 19 Democrats and 10 Republicans, have announced their plans to leave. Of those 29, 13 Democrats and three Republicans are running for other offices, still believing in public service. Some are at the natural end of a very long career, such as Rep. Kay Granger (Tex.), 80, whose GOP career started as Fort Worth mayor in 1991. And one — Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) — is running from scandal and indictments. So those retirement numbers, for now, are in line with previous sessions of Congress. But all retirements are not created equally. “It’s not the quantity of retirements. It’s the quality,” said former congressman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), who retired in 2017. “These are people who really understand how to get things done.” Israel remains close to many lawmakers, particularly those elected during his four-year run — 2011 through 2014 — as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Two members of Israel’s class of 2012, Reps. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.) and Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), jolted their colleagues with their retirement announcements. Not quite 11 full years into their tenure on Capitol Hill, they should be heading into their prime legislative years. Kildee is climbing the ranks of the Ways and Means Committee, with its tax and health policy jurisdiction, and Kilmer is now midway up the dais of the Appropriations Committee, with its control of more than $1.7 trillion in federal funds. Kilmer succeeded Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), who spent 36 years in the House as a prominent appropriator, just as Kildee’s predecessor, Dale Kildee (D-Mich.), his uncle, had spent 36 years in Congress. Kilmer is so devoted to the institution that for four years he chaired a select committee that worked on modernizing the House, trying to make it a more civil place. Moreover, both Kilmer and Kildee are close to the new crop of Democratic leaders — Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), elected in 2012; Minority Whip Katherine M. Clark (Mass.), elected in 2013; and Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), elected in 2014. These two would be poised to wield a lot of unseen influence if they stuck around and Democrats won the House majority next November. Instead, Kildee, 65, had a bout with cancer earlier this year and, despite getting a “cancer-free” diagnosis, decided it was time to move on. “After spending time with my wife, children and grandchildren and contemplating our future, the time has come for me to step back from public office. Running for office, ultimately, is a personal decision first,” he said in his statement. Ina Seattle Times op-ed,Kilmer, 49, wrote that he remains “hopeful” for a lot of progress in Congress after he departs, citing his modernizing panel’s bipartisan work and a productive 2021-2022 session on issues that got little attention such as flooding and forest management. “I find hope in the fact that — little by little — we’re providing more opportunity so people have a shot, no matter what Zip code they live in,” he wrote. The brain drain in the House can be seen in data provided bythe Center for Effective Lawmaking, a joint project by public policy experts at Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia. In 2003, 34 percent of House members were in their third term or less, meaning they had been in office less than five years. By 2021, according to the center’s data, almost 46 percent of House members had served less than five years. There’s a real fear that, as lawmakers spend more time with family over the year-end holidays, a flood of retirement announcements could come early in the new year. Recent events — ranging from the expulsion of the House speaker and an ensuing three-week paralysis in selecting a new one, to the partisan vitriol still lingering from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol — have left some lawmakers incensed at the climate here. Jacob Bogage, The Washington Post’s economic policy reporter in the Capitol,spoke to several lawmakers about the constant brinkmanship of possible government shutdowns, but also asked some about their decisions to retire. “You’re rewarding the wrong kind of behavior here,” said Rep. Brian Higgins (D-N.Y.), who announced his retirement a few days ago. “My concern is the trend has just begun, it’s not ending. And my sense is, I can just do more constructive things with my life.” He noted how some Republicans heckled President Bidenduring the State of the Union address and how they have forced instant votes on censuring Democrats or trying to impeach the president or Cabinet members without substantive investigations. “I’m just afraid that the performative nature of the House today, the people that — you know their names, they’re household names now — and the people that are making names for themselves are making spectacles of themselves,” Higgins said. Despite a two-year run that saw many of his lifelong legislative issues such as infrastructure and manufacturing get big wins, Blumenauer was just as bleak. “I don’t think being in Congress is the best way for me to make progress. I don’t second-guess anybody who’s there. But for me, I couldn’t justify two more years of my life,” he told Bogage. “Life is short. I don’t want to be a part of this charade. And I won’t be.” Israel, who has talked to dozens of Democrats the last few years about their future, said there’s a common worry that the GOP caucus has become such a quagmire that there are not enough legislative partners to work with. Their questions about retiring come down to the same thing, he said. “Tell me what happiness looks like in a post-congressional career.” Plenty of Republicans have similar frustrations. Lesko, who chaired multiple committees in the Arizona legislature, got appointed two years ago to the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, and she was promoted to vice chair of the oversight subcommittee this year. In October, barely five years after winning a special election to the House, Lesko, 65, announced she will leave at the end of next year. “In good times, this place is frustrating and hard to get things done, but now it’s especially hard,” she told Punchbowl News’s Mica Soellner. Kilmer, like quite a few retiring lawmakers, pointed to the 15 rounds of voting that it took in early January to elect Rep. Kevin Mc Carthy (R-Calif.) as a key moment of dysfunction. Mc Carthy only won the speaker’s gavel after giving in to demands from a small group of far-right lawmakers, several of whom — including Buck —eventually used his concessions to oust him from the job last month. At one point in early January, Kilmer joked with the House chaplain, Margaret G.

He was 74. The cause was cardiac arrest following several surgeries in recent weeks, said his partner, Maria Mastorakos. The son of a Boston City Council president — with an accent to show for his Massachusetts upbringing — Mr. Ahearn started his political life as a Democrat but changed his party allegiance in 1972, when U.S. Sen.George S. Mc Governof South Dakota won the Democratic presidential nomination as a standard-bearer of the party’s liberal wing. Mr. Ahearn joined the reelection campaign of President Richard M. Nixonthat year and, in the decades that followed, worked for every Republican president, whether as a campaign staffer or in the White House or both, through the 2016 and 2020 presidential bids of Donald Trump. Mr. Ahearn was perhaps best known as an aide to Reagan, whom he served beginning in the 1980 campaign that propelled the former California governor and Hollywood actor to office. “Rick Ahearn doesn’t exactly tuck the Reagans into bed at night,” a reporter for the Boston Globe observed in 1980. “But he is one of the first people they see in the morning and the last they see at night.” He had a broad portfolio of assignments over the years but was especially valued for his work on the staff that helps prepare for and execute appearances by presidents andpresidential candidates. As an advance man, Mr. Ahearn combined the skills of an event planner, travel agent, bouncer, booster, theatrical director and traffic cop — even those of an oracle as he attempted to provide for every contingency. Advance staffers have no part in setting policy. But they provide critical support to an administration through the orchestration of events designed to enhance the president’s image and agenda. Mr. Ahearn, who was Catholic, helped oversee Reagan’s meetings with Pope John Paul II. An Irishman by heritage, he arranged for the president to have a pint of beer at a pub in Ballyporeen, Reagan’s ancestral home, during adiplomatic tripto Ireland in 1984. “The images of his visit to the pub got more coverage and have endured a lot longer than just remarks he would make to the Irish legislature,” said Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and former publisher of The Washington Post, who met Mr. Ahearn while doing volunteer advance work on Reagan’s 1980 campaign. Mr. Ahearn was the lead advance representative for Reagan at perhaps the most traumatic moment of his presidency, on March 30, 1981, when a gunman, John Hinckley Jr., fired six shots as Reagan exited the Washington Hilton hotel after delivering a speech to members of the AFL-CIO. Secret Service pushed Reagan into a waiting limousine. Mr. Ahearn, who said he initially mistook the shots for firecrackers, was struck in the eye and cheek by glass when a bullet hit a car window. The president was shot, as were a Secret Service agent, Timothy Mc Carthy, and a D.C. police officer, Thomas Delahanty. But White House press secretary James S. Brady, who took a bullet in the head, was the most seriously wounded. Mr. Ahearn saw Brady “go down like a sack of potatoes,” he recalled, and immediately began administering first aid. “When I ran over to him and knelt down next to him, he was face down on the sidewalk next to a grate and he was trying to get up,” Mr. Ahearntold the London Guardianyears later. “He was trying to speak and, as he turned his head, I could see that the bullet had entered his left forehead and pretty much devastated his head, so I immediately pulled out my pocket handkerchief and tried to stanch the bleeding and hold his head together.” Mr. Ahearn was credited with helping to save Brady’s life when he challenged an ambulance driver who at first said that Brady was to be transported to Washington Hospital Center — with traffic, a 20-minute drive away. Mr. Ahearn insisted that they instead rush to George Washington University Hospital, which was much closer, and which they later learned was the facility where Reagan was taken. “Jim Brady would not have survived the trip to Washington Hospital Center,” Arthur I. Kobrine, a neurosurgeon who cared for him, later told the Kansas City Star. “He was getting ready to die when they wheeled him into the emergency room.” After the shooting, Mr. Ahearn was a near-constant presence at the hospital from morning until night, assisting Brady, his wife,Sarah Brady, Reagan and Nancy Reagan. He said he heard Reagan’s oft-quoted quip to his doctors, “I hope you’re all Republicans,” and his remark to the first lady: “Honey, I forgot to duck.” Brady was partially paralyzed but remained active in public life for years as an advocate for gun control. Hedied in 2014at 73. Frederick Leonard Ahearn was born in Boston on Nov. 6, 1949. His father, after serving on the Boston City Council in the 1950s, became first deputy secretary of state for Massachusetts. Mr. Ahearn’s mother was a homemaker. Through his father, Mr. Ahearn became involved in politics from a young age, handing out leaflets for Boston Democrats as early as age 7. He worked for Boston mayor John F. Collinsand as a student at Boston College rallied young voters to the unsuccessful 1968 Democratic presidential campaign of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. Mr. Ahearn did his first advance work for Humphrey. Mr. Ahearn graduated from college in 1971. After Mc Govern won the presidential nomination the following year, Mr. Ahearn told a reporter that “at this point … I consider myself a Democrat without a home, and unless I see some distinct changes in the Democratic Party, I will become a Republican.” Mr. Ahearn worked on the 1976 campaign of President Gerald Ford. In the Reagan administration, he rose to the position of deputy director of the presidential advance office. In subsequent elections, he worked for the campaigns of George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Trump, for whom he helped negotiate the terms of presidential debates, according to Bill Dal Col, his longtime business partner at Potomac Communications Strategies, a political consulting firm. Mr. Ahearn joined the unsuccessful presidential campaigns of candidates including Jack Kemp in 1988, Steve Forbes in 2000 and Rudy Giuliani in 2008. The Republican vice presidents and vice-presidential nominees he served included, most recently,Mike Pence. Mr. Ahearn was married to Pamela Gardner Ahearn, who held several top government protocol positions, from 1990 until her death in 2007. Besides Mastorakos, his partner of 11 years, of Falmouth, Mass., and Alexandria, Va., survivors include a brother. Just as he had attended to Reagan in life, Mr. Ahearn guarded the president’s legacy after his death. When Reagandied in 2004, Mr. Ahearn helped oversee his funeral rites from coast to coast, a mission that aides had dubbed “Operation Serenade.” In particular,according tothe Reagan foundation and institute, it was Mr. Ahearn who asked that the boots hanging from the riderless horse in the caisson procession to the U.S. Capitol be left “scuffed, but not dusty,” because “that is how Ronald Reagan would have worn them.”","November 17, 2023 at 4:49 p.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
249,Washington Post,Georgia prosecutor in Trump election case proposes Aug. 5 trial date,Amy Gardner and Amy Gardner,"The Georgia prosecutor leading the election-interference case against former president Donald Trumpand 14 remaining co-defendants requested a trial date of Aug. 5, 2024, in a motion filed Friday afternoon. The request, made to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott Mc Afee, notes that two criminal cases against Trump in federal court are scheduled for March and May, respectively, so an August start date in the Georgia case is “unlikely to be subject to delay or interference from these other trials.” The motion does not mention new uncertainty about one of those cases, a federal case unfolding in Florida that accuses Trump and others of mishandling classified documents. While the case is still scheduled for May, U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannonsaid last weekthat she will revisit deadlines in the case in early March. The Fulton motion also sets a final plea hearing date of June 21, after which prosecutors will not entertain negotiated plea deals from defendants. It also argues against any consideration before that date of splitting up the case into multiple trials because of the number of defendants — and suggests that prosecutors will argue strenuously against any severing at all. So far, four of the original defendants have accepted negotiated plea deals. Because all the defendants have been charged under Georgia’s anti-racketeering statute, the same evidence would have to be presented for all of them. Quoting federal precedent, the filing states: “It would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal justice system to require … that prosecutors bring separate proceedings, presenting the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution’s case beforehand.” The motion is sure to draw vociferous objections from the defendants — notably Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, who, if nominated, would be forced to sit in an Atlanta courtroom day after day in the final weeks of the general-election campaign, and possibly on Election Day itself and into 2025. Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead lawyer in the Georgia case, filed a motion later Friday objecting to the proposed trial date and requesting ""the opportunity to present oral argument in opposition to the motion at a hearing to be held at a time convenient to the Court.” Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, lashed out against the move, saying “Radical Democrat Fani Willis has again proven that her case is purely political, designed to interfere with President Trump’s re-election by demanding a trial date in the most vital time in President Trump’s winning campaign."" Subscribe to The Trump Trials, our weekly email newsletter on Donald Trump's four criminal cases The government’s motion, signed personally by Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis, makes no mention of the election calendar next year. But in an appearance at The Washington Post on Tuesday, Willis objected to the idea that a person who commits a crime should not be held accountable because they are running for office. “I don’t, when making decisions about cases to bring, consider any election cycle or an election season,” Willis said. “That does not go into the calculus. What goes into the calculus is: This is the law. These are the facts. And if the facts show you violated the law, then charges are brought,” Willis said. She added: “It would be a really sad day if, when you’re under investigation for this shoplifting charge, you could go run for city council, and the investigation would stop. That’s foolishness, and it’s foolishness at any level. ” In that interview at The Washington Post Live’s Global Women’s Summit,Willis(D) acknowledged that the anticipated trial could be ongoing on Election Day 2024 and possibly still underway on Inauguration Day. “I believe in that case there will be a trial. I believe the trial will take many months. And I don’t expect that we will conclude until the winter or the very early part of 2025,” Willis said. In the filing Friday, Willis wrote: “This proposed trial date balances potential delays from Defendant Trump’s other criminal trials in sister sovereigns and the other Defendants’ constitutional speedy trial rights.” Thesweeping Fulton indictment, unsealed in August, accused Trump and 18 co-defendants — including Rudy Giuliani, his former personal attorney; Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff; former Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark; and former Georgia GOP chairman David Shafer — of a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal the 2020 election. The charges fall into several buckets of alleged criminal behavior: the meeting of the Trump slate of presidential electors in Atlanta; Trump’s pressure campaign seeking help from multiple Georgia state officials in reversing his defeat; a breach of election equipment in rural Coffee County, Ga., in a hunt for evidence of fraud; and harassment of two local election workers in Fulton County who were falsely accused of counting fraudulent ballots on election night. The case is separate from the federal election interference investigation by special counsel Jack Smith, in which only Trump has been charged so far.

250,Washington Post,Gag order against Trump temporarily lifted in New York fraud trial,Shayna Jacobs and Shayna Jacobs,"NEW YORK — An appellate judge on Thursday temporarily lifted a limited gag order issued against Donald Trumpand his attorneys in the $250 million civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The temporary pause on the order allows Trump and his defense team to discuss the judge’s law clerk, pending further appellate review. The decision followed a hearing at the Appellate Division’s First Department before Judge David Friedman. Friedman wrote after hearing arguments that the stay was being imposed in consideration of “constitutional and statutory rights at issue.” Trump lawyer Christopher Kise argued that security concerns cited by New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, who is presiding over the fraud trial and issued the gag order against Trump on Oct. 3, are undermined because the judge allows news photographers to take pictures of his clerk. “If I were concerned about my safety I wouldn’t be sitting there mugging for the camera repeatedly every time the cameras come in,” Kise argued to Friedman, noting that as Trump’s attorney for about a year, he has also received threats. Sign up for The Trump Trials, a weekly newsletter tracking Trump's four criminal cases Kise also said it is not proper to impose a speech prohibition “based on an audience’s reaction.” He said Trump, who isrunning for presidentagain in 2024, had a right to free speech for campaign purposes. Engoron imposed a gag order on the former president for making public comments about the clerk that he believed endangered the clerk’s safety. The order was issued after Trump posted a photo of the employee on social media that the judge said led to threats. The judge has fined Trump twice for a total of $15,000 for violating the gag order. Trump celebrated the appellate judge’s order on social media Thursday evening. “Judge Arthur Engoron has just been overturned (stayed!) by the New York State Appellate Division (Appeals Court), for the 4th TIME (on the same case!),” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “His Ridiculous and Unconstitutional Gag Order, not allowing me to defend myself against him and his politically biased and out of control, Trump Hating Clerk, who is sinking him and his Court to new levels of LOW, is a disgrace.” Trump’s attorneys were placed under a similar gag order barring them from referring to the court employee when making legal arguments about the fairness of the proceeding. Trump’s side has argued repeatedly that the law clerk is biased and that her role as a close adviser to Engoron poisons the lawsuit, which accuses Trump, his two adult sons, two other executives and his company of falsely inflating the values of assets on financial documents to get better terms from lenders and insurance firms. Trump denies wrongdoing. Lisa Evans, an attorney arguing on behalf of Engoron, told the appeals court that the judge’s clerk is being inundated with messages that are causing concern after her phone number and other personal details were posted on social media by Trump supporters. The lawyer said Trump does not have to make threats himself because his army of devotees are at the ready to do so, citing an attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband and Trump’s incitement of the Jan. 6insurrection as proof. “It is inciting action on behalf of those individuals who are loyal to Mr. Trump … it’s not political speech,” Evans argued. She said many of the messages aimed at the law clerk are antisemitic. Daniel Magy, an attorney for James’s office, argued that the gag orders are reasonable because they are so limited. “Any party can make a statement about the judge, any party can make a statement about the attorney general and Mr. Trump has made many statements about [James] online and in the press.” The two sides are expected to file written arguments this month. It’s not clear when a full appellate panel will rule on the case. The New York gag order is the second imposed on Trump by a judge that has been suspended while an appeals court considers the issue. In Washington, U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan barred Trump from making statements targeting witnesses, prosecutors or court staff involved with his upcomingtrial on charges of conspiringto obstruct the results of the 2020 election. That gag order has been suspended while Trump’s legal team appeals Chutkan’s ruling. A hearing in that appeal is scheduled for Monday.

251,Washington Post,Ask Amy: Stuck in the middle of my spouse and friend’s argument,Amy Dickinson and Amy Dickinson,"Dear Amy:My spouse and a close friend of ours recently had a heated and deep argument. This involved philosophic and even theological differences, which had never before been revealed. This unresolved conflict left my spouse unwilling to discuss the subject any further, and our friend hurt and dismayed at the lack of willingness on my spouse’s part for a continued debate on the issue. I am feeling caught in the middle. I am trying hard to stay neutral because both people are important to me. Obviously, I am loyal and supportive to my spouse. However, over the years, I have also become a close confidant to our friend. At this point, my spouse just wants to move on. But our friend, who we see often, is obviously hurting and feeling betrayed. That said, as of late, my neutrality has started to feel forced and uncomfortable. Do I say something to my friend to try to assuage the problem, and yet be disloyal to my spouse? Or do I remain neutral and risk losing a good friend? — Trying to be the Good Guy Trying:Your spouse claims to want to “move on.” I take this to mean that your spouse would basically like to table this conflict and move forward, awkward as that might be. If that is the case, then I wonder why your friend is left feeling hurt and betrayed. Would the friend like to continue the conversation to try to persuade your spouse to adopt the friend’s point of view? Engaging in a “continued debate” is not everyone’s idea of a useful or productive way to conduct a relationship, especially if the parties don’t communicate effectively or respectfully when they are discussing their differences. I suggest that you work on examining your own perspective. The disagreement is between the two parties. You should feel comfortable speaking to your friend without believing you are being disloyal to your spouse, as long as you basically urge both parties in the same direction: “I hope you two can work things out to the extent that at the very least you agree to disagree so that we can all move forward in our friendship. That’s the most important thing to me.” Dear Amy:I have been with my fiancé for 25 years. We’ve lived together for all of that time. I opened my door to his kids and thought we were all family, but I found out that’s not the case. My fiancé's grandson died suddenly, and in the death notice his deceased wife was mentioned (as it should be) and all the aunts’ husbands were also mentioned, but nowhere was I mentioned as a loving partner to my fiancé. This was no oversight, nor have his children supported my concern about it. I have since closed my door to them. I regularly see in death notices that partners are kindly mentioned. Am I wrong to be so hurt? — Wounded Wounded:You are not wrong to be hurt by this. I imagine that you feel you have been deleted from the family fold. I urge you, however, to consider your reaction to this slight. You have made your stand during a tragic time in this family’s life. Please keep in mind that one of your fiancé’s children has lost a child. A child. You don’t know who composed the death notice, and under what circumstances. Ideally, after noticing the slight, you would have held onto your immediate hurt reaction until the dust had settled somewhat, and then talked to your fiancé, who absolutely should have expressed his disappointment over this exclusion. You don’t note why you have remained a fiancé for such a long time. I wonder what role, if any, your partner’s children might have in possibly pressuring your partner not to remarry. If that’s the case, then your status in this family has been revealed in a particularly painful way. Dear Amy:I loved your advice for “Daniel’s Mom” regarding an unexpected game of “guess who’s coming to dinner?” (Her son, who had always dated women, was now dating a man.) I was “Daniel” in this exact situation a couple of years ago. Our solution? My partner and I sent Christmas cards to family and friends, featuring our smiling faces, holding hands, and: “Make the Yuletide Gay” in big rainbow letters across the front.

252,Washington Post,Miss Manners: Cousin always invites me to dinner and then cancels,Judith Martin and Judith Martin,"Dear Miss Manners:I have a cousin who calls almost weekly to invite me over for dinner during the upcoming weekend — but nine times out of 10, the invitation gets rescinded or canceled. After I accept, she says she’ll call later in the week to confirm in case she gets busy. (I don’t understand the need to confirm, since I’ve already accepted, and she’s the one inviting me.) Usually, she’ll call on the day of the dinner and give some excuse: She and her husband are tired from a late party the night before; her daughter is having a bad day and doesn’t feel like company; they had a busy day and won’t have time to cook; or they invited several other couples over and there won’t be room for me. Sometimes there is no excuse, just: “Sorry, it doesn’t work for us.” Often, she’ll ask me to come over the next night instead — and most of the time, that’s canceled, too (once, when I was five minutes from their house after a 45-minute drive there). Other than something serious and unexpected, like an illness or a house fire, isn’t an invitation an invitation, period? And is confirmation necessary? Note that I’ve stopped accepting her invitations, and now thank her and regretfully cite other plans or a big project at work. The invitations keep coming, but now with a tinge of annoyance. If the annoyancebecomes more than a tinge, and you get asked outright about your absences, Miss Manners suggests you say, “I miss seeing you, but always feel like such a burden when you have to make last-minute cancellations. Once your schedule calms down and you feel certain you can make a commitment, please do let me know.” And if you once again get hoodwinked, at least you will have been sufficiently warned. Dear Miss Manners:I am a volunteer docent at a nonprofit arts organization, and I give public online presentations. Afterward, fellow docents (some of whom I don’t personally know) email me to say something like, “Your presentation was great. Thank you for doing it.” Must I respond? And if so, how? Both “thank you” and “you’re welcome” seem to be called for. They are. Orperhaps, “So kind of you to say so.” Presumably, these fellow docents know the effort it takes to do a good job at these presentations. Miss Manners therefore thinks their kindness should be gratefully acknowledged. And noted, so that you can thank them in kind when it is their turn. Dear Miss Manners:What would be an appropriate response to, “What do you do during the day?” This has happened more than once, and I don’t want to insult anyone. I’m 75 and retired. Due to health issues and a lack of friends, I don’t do much at all. But I can’t say that, so I almost always make something up. That doesn’t feel right, either.

253,Washington Post,Ask Sahaj: I am filled with anxiety about my son’s college application process,Sahaj Kaur Kohli and Sahaj Kaur Kohli,"Dear Sahaj:My husband and I are first generation South Asian immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now raising kids here. The looming prospect of the college application process is causing more stress than I expected, with the added layer of pressure that comes from within our community. While we come from a highly educated family, we are not overly concerned with shallow prestige. We just want our child to find the best fit for him. I usually have a healthy disregard for what others think, but it took time to get to this mental place. But now that my own child is about to launch into the world, I am fraught with anxiety. The process itself is daunting and where he will land is uncertain. Some of this is simply the emotional angst any parent feels about their first child leaving the nest. Our oldest child is thoughtful, capable and smart, but even with this confidence, we harbor no illusions about how challenging it will be. Yes, each child will find their own path, but we do not want our child to suffer unnecessarily, as there will always be unavoidable challenges. We are grateful for the strength of communication that we  have with him, and we have managed to stay calm because push has not come to shove — yet. Added to this are younger siblings who are watching and absorbing our every move. How do we preserve our strong and close relationship with our child while having no regrets in the future about how we handled the college application process? I’m not looking for perfection here, just a plan to manage the next year. — Concerned Desi Mom Concerned Desi Mom:You have your own internalized narratives about school, work and success and these are impacting your perspective of this process and your concern for your son. Historically, Asian immigrants have had to prove themselves as valuable to the U.S. economy  to be accepted, and, for many immigrants, making safer decisions that ensure survival and security is important. These are valid experiences, but it’s important to interrogate them because it may not be your son’s realitytoday.For instance, your son may have more options than you and your husband did as newer immigrants in this country. By challenging your beliefs, you can allow yourself to consider more possibilities of the future. Have a question for Sahaj? Ask her here. Your son is navigating his own feelings about this process. Right now, home should be a safe space for him to explore questions without judgment or pressure. Be encouraging and celebrate every win during this process; also be mindful that you are not imposingyouranxieties onto your son. It’s not about eliminating worry altogether. It’s about learning to manage your worry so you can be present and connected with your son. Consider reaching out to other parents in your community who are in the same situation to give you an outlet separate to the relationship you have with your son. Schedule time in your calendar where you can take 15 minutes to let yourself worry. This will help you acknowledge not avoid it, but it will also ensure a time cap so your “what ifs” and anxiety don’t take over your life. Create a tool kit of coping skills — like deep breathing and mindfulness — to manage anxiety as it arises. Remind yourself of your own ability to get through hard times. Ask yourself: What are difficult things you have overcome? How did you do it? Who supported you? Of course no parent wants their kid to suffer unnecessarily, but no matter how much you want to protect your child from all “unavoidable challenges,” you can’t. Your son is at an age where he is learning how to be accountable for himself and his choices. Where appropriate, you want to encourage this autonomy and critical thinking while being a guiding light for him. You can practice and learn how to support your kid without imposing yourself onto him by trusting that you have provided him with the values and skills he needs to go out into the world. You are worried because you care. You are worried because you want the best for your son. But here’s the thing: Worry provides a falsesense of control. You can only solve the future’s problems in the future. Focus on what you canactuallycontrol rightnow— like how you manage your stress or setting up a plan to tour colleges or tackle deadlines with your son. This is an important year to connect with and enjoy your son before he goes off on this new stage of his life — and possibly leaves your home. You don’t want to worry so much about what can go wrong that you miss it.

254,Washington Post,Work Advice: How much notice should I give before retiring?,Karla L. Miller and Karla L. Miller,"Reader 1:I’m 62 and plan to officially retire seven or eight months from now. My plan is to give about three months’ notice to allow for a smooth transition, but my supervisor is giving me new responsibilities and assignments, which are adding some ethical questions of timing. At what point should I notify my supervisor about my retirement plans? Reader 2:My husband asked his boss how much advance notice of his retirement plans would be needed and was told three months. Now he has decided on a retirement date and needs to inform his boss soon. How should he phrase his announcement? If the boss somehow manages to find a replacement sooner, he may cut my husband loose before he’s ready. We’re planning on using his paychecks during those three months to add to our retirement funds. Karla:Hold up. People still retire? With, like, gold watches and farewell parties? I joke, but only partly. First, it’s commonly acknowledged that longer life expectancy, market-battered savings accounts and the climbing cost of living havemoved retirement goal postswell past age 65 for many people. And here’s a darker observation: A large percentage of U.S. workers older than 50 are being pushed prematurely out of longtime jobs — too early to segue into retirement but too late to regain their footing at full income. A pre-pandemicstudyby Pro Publica and the Urban Institute put that percentage at 56 percent of workers; more recently,Forbes, USA Today and my inbox suggest this trend is continuing, if not accelerating. Giving a lengthy heads-up about retirement plans just seems to be baring your neck for the ax. “How much notice do [employers] give when they’re kicking an employee to the curb? That would be as much as I would offer [before retiring],” said Kevin Marek of Rhode Island, who spent 30 years in insurance administration before his job was eliminated with two weeks’ notice. Likewise, I would be inclined to give the same advice for retirement as for resignations: no more notice than the length of time you can afford to go without that paycheck. But after I put out acallfor readers to share their experience, almost all respondents said they gave their employers at least 3 to 6 months’ notice, and sometimes more, with no regrets or concerns. So the traditional guideline for retirement notice hasn’t expired yet. But you first need to ask yourself some questions about your individual situation. Most of the retirees advocating more notice were from academia and government, where careers are long, change is slow and hiring qualified replacements is lengthy and complex. Thus the threat of being pushed out early is minimal. Yvonne Stam, a retired judge in Chapel Hill, N.C., noted that legal and medical occupations often schedule work six months to a year in advance. Giving at least six months’ notice is expected “in fairness to your colleagues who have to assume your workload,” she said in an email. Ask Amy: When should I give notice that I plan to retire? Larger private-sector companies with redundant positions generally can more easily absorb departures, so a long heads-up may not be necessary — or advisable. But in bureaucratic or short-staffed environments, even six months to a year of notice may not be long enough. When Karen Feldt, a nurse educator in Lancaster, Pa., gave six months’ notice, responses ranged from denial (“You aren’t really ready to retire”) to panic (“You can’t go anywhere until we get through this [project, transition, crisis]”). Her employer had not found a replacement by the time she left. Teresa Adams of Madison, Wis., actually received a promotion during her retirement notice period when her boss abruptly left for another job three months out and she was the only viable successor. Chuck Taylor of Atlanta said a hiring freeze at his health-care-system employer made it difficult to bring in a replacement, even with a year’s notice. “They ended up engaging me on a short-term 1099 contract after my employment ended” to help train his eventual replacement, Taylor said in an email. We all want to think we’re indispensable, but it’s crucial to have a realistic concept of the role you play. Executive coach Emily Rothberg noted on Linked In that for C-suite executives, at least a year’s notice of retirement is a standard succession-planning strategy “so key stakeholders … don’t panic, thinking the org is adrift, or at risk.” Amanda Cockrell, founding director of a graduate program at Hollins University, gave a full year’s notice to allow time to transfer her institutional knowledge to her colleagues. “After 26 years, most of the program resided inside my personal head,” she said in an email. “If I had given them only a month’s notice or something like that, it would have been an awful mess.” Having unique skills or duties offers some security. Mary Ryan of Baltimore gave a year’s notice to allow time to hire and train someone to take over her exclusive administrative duties. “I am the ONLY person who does contracts, marketing and some other responsibilities” at her 25-person company, she said. You might want to ration your notice on a need-to-know basis. Some readers notified key management or HR early in the process to allow for planning but waited to make a general announcement to colleagues to avoid an awkward lame duck period. If you have service milestones coming up, letting management know your plans can help protect benefits you’re entitled to. When David Jones of Kapolei, Hawaii, learned that his medical insurance employer would be outsourcing his position, he pointed out that the termination would leave him just six months shy of a crucial 15-year milestone for retiree medical coverage. Whether out of generosity, or to avoid looking as though it was illegally trying to prevent Jones from claiming that retirement benefit, the employer extended Jones’s layoff date so he could meet the mark for coverage. Fired FBI chief Andrew Mc Cabe wins back pension in settlement with DOJ So now, having learned from these retirees, here’s what I advise: Reader 1:It’s a good sign that you’ve been given more duties. That indicates your employer values your work — and it’s good insurance against being nudged out early. You’re probably safe letting at least your boss know of your retirement plans if these new tasks require a long-term commitment. But even if you’re not ready to share the news, make sure you’re documenting your work and communicating project details to colleagues in the meantime. They’ll appreciate it later. Reader 2:It’s dicey for your husband to offer less notice than the boss specifically requested. But if he doesn’t trust the employer to let him complete his exit on his schedule, he might give a shorter notice, but soften it by offering to be available post-retirement to consult, recruit and help train his replacement if needed. Paid, of course. Whatever your situation, retiring on your own terms is ideal, as did Kelly M., a legal secretary from Seattle. Even though her employer required three months for retirement notice, she resigned with two weeks’ notice. “I had seen over the years friends of mine following such requests only to be shown the door much earlier by other firms,” she said. “I had my finances in order and was ready to go. No animosity on my part, but no reason to delay my departure.”","November 16, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
255,Washington Post,Study undercuts premise for excluding women from medical research,,"Women’s body temperatures are no more variable than men’s, despite menstrual cycles and hormonal variability, a recent monitoring study suggests. Theanalysis, published in the journal Biology of Sex Differences, casts doubt on an idea that has long colored biomedical research — that ovarian cycles make females unsuited for drug trials and other clinical experiments. That claim — along with gender discrimination and other factors — is thought to fuel women’s ongoingunderrepresentationin such trials, which continues despite a concerted effort by the federal government and researchers to bolster sex-specific research. When researchers looked at six months’ worth of continuous body temperature data from a group of males and females, they found that despite sex differences in body temperature, neither group was more variable than the other. The researchers looked at temperature data from a pool of age-matched 20-to-79-year-olds: 300 females and 300 males. The participants were part of a broader University of California study,Tem Predict, designed to track vital signs and help predict the onset ofcoronavirussymptoms. Women are still underrepresented in clinical trials Over the course of six months, patients wore an Oura ring, a wearable “smart ring” that monitors heart rate, respiration, body temperature and movement. (Oura Health Oy, the Finnish technology company that produces the ring, was one of the study’s funders.) When the scientists delved into the body temperature data, comparing it across sex and over time and looking for excessive variability or measurement errors among females, they did find sex differences. Women with menstrual cycles showed temperature fluctuations across a roughly 28-day cycle, confirming that ovarian rhythms do affect body temperature. But those differences did not confound or sully the data, and the researchers note that the predictability of the women’s temperature variability actually made their temperatures easier to predict than men’s. “In this study, the difference between two men is bigger than the difference between the average man and the average woman,” Lauryn Keeler Bruce, the paper’s first author and a Ph D student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at UC San Diego, said in anews release. “In addition, the variability between men and women is not statistically significant.” Temperatures cycled along with sleep and wake patterns and time of day for both sexes. Because no one group consistently proved more variable, the researchers conclude that women’s temperature data is no more unreliable than men’s. “These findings contradict the viewpoint that human females are too variable across menstrual cycles to include in biomedical research,” the researchers write. Pregnancy or sex-specific cancers might create larger effects, they note. But that’s no reason to exclude women from medical research, they conclude: “Females still need to be more routinely included in research, and we find no statistical evidence that doing so would negatively affect study power.”","November 18, 2023 at 6:30 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
256,Washington Post,FTC cracks down on food industry for paid dietitian ‘influencer’ posts,Caitlin Gilbert and Sasha Chavkin and Anahad O’Connor and Caitlin Gilbert and Sasha Chavkin and Anahad O’Connor,"Federal regulatorsannounced warningsagainst two major food and beverage industry groups and a dozen nutrition influencers Wednesday, as part of a broad action toenforce stricter standards for how companies and social media creators disclose paid advertising. The Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters Monday to the American Beverage Association, a lobbying group whose members include Coca-Cola and Pepsi Co, as well as the Canadian Sugar Institute and the health influencers who collectively have over 6 million followers on Tik Tok and Instagram. The agency flagged nearly three dozen social media posts that it said failed to clearly disclose who was paying the influencers to promote artificial sweeteners or sugary foods. The crackdown, which represents more aggressive enforcement of the FTC’s rules, signals that the agency seeks to set a new precedent for holding both influencers and industry accountable for social media marketing campaigns that fail to make clear who is funding them. The action also could dramatically change the social media feeds of popular influencers who now often rely on vague hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored rather than clearly naming the brand or company paying them. The action follows a months-longinvestigationby The Washington Post and the Examination, a nonprofit newsroomthat focuses on global health reporting, that revealed how the food and beverage industry had enlisted popular dietitians to promote industry-friendly messages on social media posts that often failed to disclose the names of sponsors. The food industry pays 'influencer' dietitians to shape your eating habits Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that “sophisticated groups” such as trade associations “should be familiar” with the law. With Wednesday’s action, Levine said the FTC seeks to set a precedent for disclosure that applies not only to the food and beverage industries but across the influencer marketing sector. Levine said he expects the announcement  “is going to be heard loud and clear, not only from trade associations and influencers in this space, but also in other industries that may think that influencers don’t need to disclose these connections.” An American Beverage spokesman said the group believed it had taken “meticulous steps” to be transparent about its partnerships with dietitians. “Importantly, no question has been raised about the substance of these posts,” said spokesman William Dermody. “We will continue our ongoing commitment to disclose the relationship between dietitians and American Beverage, and we appreciate the FTC’s guidance on how to best ensure transparency for consumers.” The FTC’s action reflects the agency’s latest effort to setstandardsfor social media marketing, a rapidly expanding sector that has been described as the Wild West of advertising. Over $6 billion is expected to be spent on influencer marketing in the United States in 2023, with another $7 billion to be spent in 2024, according toestimatesfrom Insider Intelligence. Among the influencers who received warning letters were registered dietitians with large followings, including Stephanie Grasso, Cara Harbstreet and Andrea Miller, as well as a physician, Idrees Mughal, who goes by the name “Dr Idz” on Tik Tok, Instagram and Facebook. “I am committed to ensuring my continued compliance with these guidelines to the fullest extent,” Harbstreet wrote in an email Thursday. “Conflicts of interest are not something I take lightly, and I have stringent standards in place to determine which partners I work with.” Grasso, Miller and Mughal haven’t responded to requests for comment. “Influencers, especially folks like dietitians and other medical providers who are trusted by the public, need to take these warnings seriously,” Levine said. “We’re disappointed to see this kind of influencer marketing.” The Canadian Sugar Institute didn’t respond to requests for comment. In September, both trade groups said the nutrition influencers they paid for social media campaigns had adequately disclosed their relationships with the trade groups through hashtags or other information listed on the social media posts. At the time, several influencers who worked with the groups also said they believed they had complied with disclosure rules by using hashtags or other notifications to followers that the posts were sponsored. Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, called the FTC’s action “terrific.” “It’s not okay for soda companies to hire dietitians to flog their products and not admit that they’re taking their money,” she said. “This is a situation in which consumer protection is absolutely essential, and the FTC is acting in the interest of consumers.” The enforcement action is the first the FTC has taken against major food and beverage industry groups for social media marketing. The agency urged the trade groups and nutrition influencers to remove posts or add proper disclosures and noted that future failures could trigger fines of more than $50,000 for each violation. The Post and Examination investigation revealed that American Beverage had paid a dozen nutrition influencers for videos that sought to undermine health warnings from the World Health Organization about aspartame, an artificial sweetener in many diet sodas. The investigation also found that the Canadian Sugar Institute paid at least a dozen dietitians for videos that encouraged people to give in to cravings for sugary foods, mocked advice to cut sugar intake and urged parents to let children eat as much candy as they want. In both cases many of the influencers used phrases such as #ad, #sponsored or “Paid partnership” in the text accompanying their videos but didn’t clearly name which organizations had paid them for the videos. The FTC said in its warning letters that these types of disclosures were “inadequate” because social media users could easily miss them. It said that the videos themselves should include “clear and conspicuous disclosures” of financial relationships. The agency also said that if product endorsements are visible or audible in social media videos then financial disclosures should be delivered the same way. The FTC also noted that some posts used phrases such as #safetyofaspartame, while others used abbreviated names of their sponsors, such as “Ameri Bev” or “cdnsugarnutr,” which the agency said didn’t make clear that industry groups are behind the ads. Other posts didn’t name their sponsors at all. In comments made on several of the posts analyzed by The Post and the Examination, viewers expressed confusion and anger at the lack of transparency by dietitians they said they trusted. A key legal test outlined in the FTC Actis whether the sponsorship would surprise consumers and affect their opinion of the message’s credibility — what the agency refers to as an “unexpected material connection.” According to Levine, the influencers and organizations receiving the warning letters may have deceived consumers by failing to fully explain their connection. “Consumers need to understand who is paying these marketers, because it will give them a better sense of how much to credit the information being provided,” Levine said. The FTC said in its warning letters that the influencers and trade groups had 15 days to respond to the agency and detail the actions they would take to address the concerns. The FTC also instructed the trade groups and influencers to review all of their social media posts to ensure that they sufficiently met the disclosure standards. The letters also note that any “violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a federal district court injunction or an administrative cease and desist order.” While the FTC has used warning letters as an enforcement mechanism for decades, the inclusion of notices of penalty in the letters marks a newer, stronger strategy for the agency to combat deceptive advertising practices by allowing it to collect civil penalties on further violations. “If companies or individuals ignore these warnings, we are fully prepared to follow up on these warnings with enforcement actions,” Levine said. “We are fully prepared to take them to court.” In 2017, the FTC sent out more than 90 warning letters in response to social media posts from celebrities, including members of the Kardashian family, who the agency said failedto disclosetheir connections to brands. In 2020, the FTC sent 10 warning letters to influencers, including rapper Cardi B, for not disclosing paid social media ads for a tea marketer.The tea company agreed to pay$1 million to settle charges that it misled consumers and didn’t adequately disclose payments to social media influencers. Bonnie Patten, executive director of Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization that combats deceptive marketing, said the FTC’s most recent action was a “win-win for consumers” that puts companies and influencers on notice. “That is a big step and could have ramifications for social media influencers more broadly,” Patten said.

257,Washington Post,"UTIs can lead to cognitive dysfunction, but there are ways to reduce risks",Richard Sima and Richard Sima,"Infections, including common ones such as urinary tract infections, have been linked to a risk of delirium and dementia. But with increased awareness, prevention strategies and available treatments, people can significantly reduce their risk, researchers say. Urinary tract infections are uncomfortable but largely treatable. If left untreated, though, UTIs can have dramatic and potentially long-lasting effects far outside our urinary tract, even on our brain. UTIs and other types of infections are closely associated with delirium, a short-term confusional state. About30 percentof older people with UTIs develop delirium, and infections account forabout halfof delirium cases. “I’m not sure patients, the general public knows how UTIs can do this,” said Shouri Lahiri, associate professor of neurology, biomedical sciences and neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. “If they’re having confusion episodes, it’s an opportunity to seek out medical advice, to evaluate for anunderlying UTI. And in doing so, not only will you preserve short-term cognition, but perhaps even long-term cognitive function.” Delirium is an acute confusional state of mind, and its hallmark characteristics — inattention, executive dysfunction and short-term memory impairment — fluctuate in severity. Triggers for delirium include infections as well as certain medical procedures and medication. Delirium is typically thought of as a temporary cognitive state, but if its cause remains “unresolved or untreated, the delirium can accelerate, can become more and more severe,” Lahiri said. “It can leave a mark that’s permanent.” It is also surprisingly common, especially among hospitalized patients. Some studies estimate that15 to 30 percentof patients in hospital wards and up to70 percent of patientswho are critically ill develop delirium. Annually,more than 2.6 million Americans older than 65 years develop delirium. Some people incorrectly think that delirium is normal for an old person. “People think delirium is safe,” said Wes Ely, professor of medicine and co-director of the Center for Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “It’s very, very dangerous. It’s a pretty absolutely precarious thing for somebody to go into delirium.” In the short term, “delirium increases hospital length of stay, it is associated with increased mortality,” Lahiri said. “It’s associated with unimaginable human suffering.” Older adults are more susceptible to delirium because they probably have age-related changes to their blood-brain barrier and less “brain reserve” to compensate for additional challenges to their brain. But delirium also has costs in the long term if not properly managed. “It’s something that accelerates chronic brain dysfunction,” Lahiri said. “I think of it as being amodifiable risk factorfor Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, because by mitigating it, you can reduce progression of these diseases.” Research has shown that people who were diagnosed with dementia and then developed delirium haddouble the rate of cognitive declinewhen compared to those who didn’t. There is also adose-response effectof delirium on long-term cognition: the more severe the delirium, the higher the risk of dementia. There is emerging evidence that infections, including UTIs, are themselves associated with an increased risk for dementia. A2021 studytracked the electronic health records of 989,800 adults age 65 and older with no previous history of dementia or cognitive impairment in the United Kingdom. After controlling for a wide range of other factors such as sex, ethnicity, smoking and alcohol consumption, researchers found that, overall, people who had any infection had 1.53 times the risk of developing dementia compared with people without infection. The more severe the infection, such as with sepsis and pneumonia, the higher the likelihood of subsequently developing dementia. People who were hospitalized had it worst, with nearly double the risk for dementia. But even milder infections, including UTIs, heightened the risk of subsequent dementia by 1.73 times. The study was associational, so it cannot prove causation. People with dementia are alsomore likely to develop infections, for example. But the risk remained elevated even up to nine or more years after infection. “What’s really needed now is to really understand the mechanisms behind this association between infections and dementia,” said Rutendo Muzambi, a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and an author of the study. Clinical trials that examine whether strategies to reduce infections lower the risk of dementia are also needed, shesaid. One common factor may be inflammation caused by an immune response to the infection — first of the body, which can then spread to the brain. The brain’s frontal lobes, which are important for executive function, and the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory, are particularly affected in delirium, said Ely, who was a co-author of areviewabout delirium in 2020. In a2021 study, Lahiri and his colleagues reported that mice with UTIs behaved in a delirium-like way — they were more anxious in mazes compared with mice that did not have a UTI. These behavioral changes correlated with increased inflammatory cytokines and neuronal changes in the mice’s frontal cortexes and hippocampuses. “Those cells are injured, and they’re not behaving well, which is why the patient can get confused,” Ely said. “And if that process continues to go on and those cells die, that’s when you have the acquisition of dementia.” Keep hydrated and urinate often to reduce the risk of UTIs. Notice if urination becomes painful, difficult or frequent, or you start having fever, chills or fatigue. Promptly seek medical treatment when experiencing UTIs. This will reduce the risk of known serious complications, including delirium and sepsis, though more evidence is required for whether this would also prevent dementia risk, Muzambi said. For caregivers, keep loved ones with delirium reoriented. Keep them mobilized, and make sure they get good sleep at night and are awake during the day, said Ely, author of “Every Deep-Drawn Breath,” a book aboutcritical careand delirium.

258,Washington Post,He won a Nobel Prize. Then he started denying climate change.,Maxine Joselow and Maxine Joselow,"BALTIMORE — At a fiery news conference at the Four Seasons hotel here Tuesday, speakers denounced climate change as a hoax perpetrated by a “global cabal” including the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and many leaders of the Catholic Church. It might have seemed like a fringe event, except forone speaker’s credentials. John F. Clausershared the Nobel Prize in physicslast year before declaring Tuesday that “there is no climate crisis” — a claim that contradicts the overwhelming scientific consensus. The event showcased Clauser’s remarkable shift since winning one of the world’s most prestigious awards for his groundbreaking experiments with light particles in the 1970s. His recent denial of global warming has alarmed top climate scientists, who warn that he is using his stature to mislead the public about a planetary emergency. Clauser, 80, who has a booming voice and white hair he often leaves uncombed, has brushed off these concerns. He says skepticism is a key part of the scientific process. “There was overwhelming consensus that what I was doing was pointless” in the 1970s, he said in an interview after the news conference. “It took 50 years for my work to win the prize. That’s how long it takes for opinions to change.” Tuesday’s event was organized by the Deposit of Faith Coalition, a group of more than a dozen Catholic organizations thatarguesthat “those pushing the anti-God and anti-family climate agenda need to be called out and exposed.” Clauser, who is an atheist, needed some convincing to be the keynote speaker, a coalition spokesman acknowledged. The other speakers included Marc Morano, a former Republican congressional staffer who runs a website that rejects mainstream climate science, and Alex Newman, a journalist for right-wing media outlets who has called for exposing the “climate scam.” Both men took multiple jabs at former vice president Al Gore and his 2006 documentary about the dangers of climate change. Clauser, who wore a gray blazer with black jeans and Teva sandals, appeared buoyant as he took the stage. He cycled through a Power Point presentation that began with the exclamation: “Great news! There is no climate crisis!” “Much as it may upset many people, my message is the planet is not in peril,” Clauser told an audience of roughly a dozen people in the hotel conference room and others watching online. “I call myself a climate denier,” he added. “I’ve been told that’s not politically correct. So I guess I’m a climate crisis d-word person.” Clauser bragged that he met privately with President Bidenin the Oval Office last year, when the 2022 Nobel Prize winners were invited to the White House. He said he criticized Biden’s climate and energy policies, to which he said the president replied: “Sounds like right-wing science.” The Washington Post could not confirm this account; a White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The vast majority of climate scientists agree that global warmingwill have catastrophic consequencesfor current and future generations. They warn that heat waves, famines and infectious diseases could claim millions of additional lives by century’s end if humanity does not rapidly reduce emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The influence of climate deniers has waned over the past several decades, as the science has become clearer and the impacts of global warming have become starker. But a small group of vocalskeptics — including several prominent physicists — has persisted. Clauser, who has never published a peer-reviewed paper on climate change, has homed in on one message in particular: Earth’s temperature is primarily determined by cloud cover, not carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. He has concluded that clouds have a net cooling effect on the planet, so there is no climate crisis. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that argument is “pure garbage” and “pseudoscience.” The “best available evidence” shows that clouds actually have a net warming effect, Mann said in an email. “In physics, we call that a ‘sign error’ — it’s the sort of error a freshman is embarrassed to be caught having made,” he said. Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, agreed. “Clouds amplify warming,” Dessler said in an email, adding, “The scientific community has spent the last century studying [climate change] and, at this point, virtually everything that’s happening has been predicted. John Clauser and his ilk ignore this because they are not advancing serious scientific critiques.” But Anton Zeilinger, an Austrian physicist who shared the Nobel Prize with Clauser last year, said in an interview that he has “very high respect” for Clauser’s scientific rigor, although he cautioned that he is not an expert on climate science. In 1972, Clauser conducted groundbreaking experiments on quantum entanglement, a process in which two or more particles are coupled so that any change in one particle triggers a simultaneous change in the other, even if they are separated by vast distances. The experiments confirmed a phenomenon that Albert Einstein had famously referred to as “spooky action at a distance.” They also paved the way for technologies such as quantum computers, which can solve problems too complex for classical computers. “Einstein, when he proposed his ideas, was considered crazy and an outsider,” said Zeilinger, a professor of physics emeritus at the University of Vienna. “It has happened in science that the majority was dead wrong. I have no idea if that is the case here, but science has to be open to debate.” Some physicists have made crucial contributions to the world’s understanding of climate change. In 2021, the Nobel Prize in physicswas awarded toscientists Syukuro Manabe of the United States and Klaus Hasselmann of Germany for work that laid the foundation for current climate models. Others have made a name for themselves as climate contrarians. William Happer, a professor emeritus of physicsat Princeton University,has argued that global warming is good for humanity. Under President Donald Trump, Happer served as a senior director on the National Security Council, where heoversaw a controversial initiative to reassessthe federal government’s analysis of climate science. Richard Lindzen, a retired MIT physicist, has similarly criticized what he has called “climate alarmism.” And Steven E. Koonin, a physicist who served as the Energy Department’s undersecretary for science under President Barack Obama, wrote the best-selling book “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.” “There is a skeptical streak in the physics community regarding climate science,” Nadir Jeevanjee, a research physical scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in arecent critiqueof Koonin’s book. In an interview, Jeevanjee said that while climate science is based in physics, not all physicists are experts in climate science. But that hasn’t stopped some distinguished physicists from portraying themselves as experts and sowing doubt, he said. “When they talk, people listen,” said Jeevanjee, who emphasized that he was speaking on behalf of himself and not NOAA. “It stokes the flames of denial.” Some physicists who reject the scientific consensus on climate change have received funding from fossil fuel companies.Wei-Hock “Willie” Soon, an astrophysicist who claims that variations in the sun’s energy have caused most global warming,accepted more than $1.2 millionfrom the fossil fuel industry from 2005 to 2015 while failing to disclose that conflict of interest in most scientific papers. Clauser said he does not receive any money from oil, gas and coal interests. “If I go to Asia, I get a huge honorarium for giving talks,” he said in the interview after Tuesday’s event. “But this conference hasn’t given me an honorarium for coming here. The best I get is airfare and hotel. I’m just living off savings.” In June, Clauser gave the keynote address at a conference on quantum information science in Seoul, telling the audience that “I don’t believe there is a climate crisis.” The speech came a month after he joined the board of directors ofthe CO2 Coalition, a group that contends carbon dioxide is beneficial for the planet. Climate deniers ejected from teachers conference for pro-carbon comic Clauser has not been welcomed everywhere. In July, he was scheduled to deliver a seminar on climate models to the International Monetary Fund’s Independent Evaluation Office, but then the event was “summarily canceled” with no explanation, the CO2 Coalition said in astatementat the time. On Tuesday, Clauser said he was initially told the event would be reformatted as a debate with an author of a report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But that idea “never went anywhere,” he said. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the office declined to comment on the record and did not respond to follow-up questions about whether the event might be rescheduled. Clauser’s message also may be reaching a limited audience. Of the roughly dozen people at the news conference in Baltimore, two were journalists and several others were members of the Deposit of Faith Coalition. Asked about the smaller crowd, Clauser, who has emphysema caused by smoking cigarettes in his younger years, took a puff of his inhaler and shrugged. “I get a reasonable amount of fan mail, some of which comes from people who claim to be climate scientists,” he said. “Most of it is very positive.”","November 16, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
259,Washington Post,Earth is taking a pounding from bigger ocean waves. Why this matters.,Kasha Patel and Kasha Patel,"When an ocean wave falls, the ground shakes. Now, those wobbles are getting bigger. Stormier seas and larger ocean swell in recent decades are pounding Earth’s seafloor with more force, sending larger ripples through Earth’s crust — almost like a tiny, tiny, tiny earthquake. The biggest wave energy increases, as measured with a seismometer, appear in the North Atlantic Ocean, according torecent research. The heightened force tracks with rising global temperatures, which can supercharge storms and make them bigger and more intense. These storms, compounded with rising sea levels, further erode land and threaten communities living on the coast. “As the waves get bigger, they push and pull harder on the floor of the ocean,” said Rick Aster, seismologist and lead author of the study. Wave energy across the world has increased 0.27 percent per year, on average, since the 1980s, the research found. It has been worse in recent years, increasing by 0.35 percent each year since 2000. A few tenths of a percent per year adds up over the decades, Aster said, amounting to about an 8 percent increase over 30 years. Oceans are the background buzz of Earth. Falling waves are constantly hitting the seafloor, sending small pulses to even the deep interiors of continents. Take out human activity, glacier quakes, earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, meteor strikes, nuclear and other explosions, and you’re left with ocean vibes. Seismometers, which measure the movement of the ground typically from earthquakes, can pick up the seismic waves from the thrashing ocean. Analyzing data from more than 50 stations worldwide, the team observed these high-seas vibrations traveling across long distances as a steady hum. Imagine waves crashing onto Earth’s crust like a finger plucking a guitar string, but creating waves on a much larger scale. The length of a wave is “tens of kilometers, and they actually propagate in the crust of the earth, so they’re really big beasts,” said Aster, head of the Geosciences Department at Colorado State University. “In the absence of earthquakes or other large transient events, it’s the dominant seismic signal on our planet.” You wouldn’t feel the ground shaking because the motion is on the scale of microns. You also wouldn’t be able to listen to any rumbles because they occur on scales way below our hearing. But we recognize these large sets of waves — the kind that excite surfers from California or Hawaii. They’re created from big storms that have high winds over long distances, Aster said. And these gnarly waves are more common than you may think, constantly hitting Earth’s seafloor because “somewhere in the world, there’s a giant storm generating these waves,” he said. The most surprising aspect of the study, Aster said, was that the wave energy increase was “happening almost everywhere on the planet.” Around 80 percent of stations showed highly significant and progressive increases in energy over the decades — a fact that would “never occur by chance."" “Global warming puts increased energy in the atmosphere, resulting in stronger storms with intensified winds that generate increased wave heights,” said oceanographer Peter Bromirski, who was not involved in the study. For example, more water is evaporated into a warmer atmosphere and becomes fuel for storms. The most powerful waves were found in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, not surprising for the sea known as the stormiest in the world. Aster explained the region is the only place where the ocean water can circle around the planet with no interruptions from landforms. But the North Atlantic Ocean experienced the highest increase in wave energy over the past four decades, compared to historical levels. Wave energy increased, on average, more than twice the global rate since the 1980s, with seismic stations in the eastern United States showing increases between 0.6 and 0.8 percent per year. The increase in the North Atlantic is stark but falls in line with other recentrecord activityin the region. The area is home to some of thefastest-warming waterin the world. It also has experienced morerapidly intensifyingor record storms, such as deadly Storm Ciarán, which pummeled the United Kingdom at the beginning of November. Hurricanes are also transitioning into big storms in the region, such as from Hurricane Ida. Wave energy also increased across the world during periods of El Niñoand La Niña, when sea surface temperatures change in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Storm activity increases in the Atlantic basin during La Niña and heightens in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean during El Niño — increasing on a global average during either event. “It’s really a measure of what the big storms are doing around the world,” Aster said. Hotter ocean waters caused by global warming, Aster noted, are also heightening effects felt from later El Niño and La Niña, sometimes producing more extreme ocean waves than a similar event decades earlier on a comparatively cooler Earth. Today’s El Niño, Aster said, may not be the same as “your father’s El Niño.” Wave activity should continue to intensify as long as temperatures keep rising, said Bromirski, oceanographer emeritus at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This increase, which hepreviously documentedin waves along the California coast, has been evident since global warming surged in the 1970s.Some sayglobal temperatures are accelerating even faster now. “Global surface temperatures during the last decade indicate that global warming is again accelerating,” Bromirski said. “Further increases in wave activity along coasts potentially will follow, aggravating issues from higher tides associated with sea level rise.” More intense waves can make it harder for people to safely live on coasts, said Itxaso Odériz, a coastal hazard researcher who was not involved in the study. Ocean waves help shape beaches, estuaries, ecosystems, ports and tourism spots. Breaking waves transport sediment, change the position of the shoreline and run up steep slopes. “If the waves are extreme, generated by storms such as extratropical cyclones, sediment transport can be substantial, causing erosion and affecting coastal infrastructure,” said Odériz, researcher at IHCantabria Instituto de Hidráulica Ambiental de la Universidad de Cantabria. “The water level can rise significantly, leading to coastal flooding.” Observations showing when, where and how waves are increasing across the planet, she said, are vital to quantifying coastal risk — especially in conjunction with data on how seas are rising along coastlines. “It’s another wake-up call for people to really get serious about paying attention to coastal infrastructure and ecosystem in a world that’s going to have larger waves on average,” Aster said.

260,Washington Post,"Southern California utility responsible for deadly 2022 fire, state officials say",Vanessa Montalbano and Brianna Sacks and Vanessa Montalbano and Brianna Sacks,"One of California’s largest utilities is responsible for a blaze that killed two people attempting to flee a fast-moving 2022 fire near Hemet, southeast of Los Angeles, according to a report from the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection obtained by The Washington Post. Southern California Edison has previously denied any allegations of its involvement in the Fairview Fire, which ignited Sept. 5, 2022, and burned more than 28,000 acres and destroyed dozens of structures while displacing tens of thousands of residents. The report, which has not yet been made public, determined that because of a sag in one of SCE’s electrical lines near Fairview Avenue in Hemet, the wire came into contact with a communication line below it and caused a flurry of sparks, igniting flammable vegetation nearby. The California Public Utilities Commissionencourages utilitiesto temporarily shut down power to specific areas at risk of a wildfire, known as a public safety power shutoff. But despite the presence of strong winds and extreme heat conditions ripe for an inferno, the Cal Firereport said, SCE’s power lines remained energized that day. “It was determined the SCE energized overhead electrical line contacted a Frontier communication line that was suspended underneath the electrical lines,” the report states. “This caused a shower of sparks, which caused the fire.” David Eisenhauer, a spokesperson for SCE, said Wednesday that the company “cooperated with Cal Fire during its review of the fire, and we’re examining their latest report.” “Our hearts are with the community and the people who suffered losses in the Fairview Fire,” he said. Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International, provides electricity to roughly 15 million people across a territory of about 50,000 square miles. It is seen as more proactive than California’s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, in taking steps to minimize fire ignitions from its equipment. Still, it facesbillions of dollars in liabilitiesfor past fires, including the 2018 Woolsey Fire, which destroyed more than 1,600 structures, killed three people and prompted the evacuation of nearly 300,000. The state report about the Fairview Firecome as the victims’ families and the city of Hemet are engaged in a lawsuit against SCE, alleging itfailed to properly manage its electrical infrastructure and maintain nearby landscaping to ensure wildfire mitigation, putting residents at an increased risk. “From the beginning of this case, we alleged that the Fairview Fire was caused by an electrical arcing event due to line-slap involving Edison’s powerlines. We’re glad that CAL FIRE has confirmed this as the official cause,” said Alexander Robertson IV, an attorney from Robertson & Associates representing Fairview Fire victims. In recent years across much of the West, fires in what is known as the wildland-urban interface have become more and more common, in part because of climate change and people moving into remote areas, but also because of utility negligence. Like the 2022 Fairview Fire,August’s deadly fire in Lahaina, Hawaii,and the 2021Marshall Firein Colorado were sparked by power linesand proved to be catastrophic when they raced through overgrown grasses into heavily populated neighborhoods. Meanwhile, California regulators on Thursday are expected to vote on whether to approve a proposal from PG&E that would raise customer costs by anywhere from 10 to 25 percent over four years to help pay for wildfire safety and prevention. PG&E wasfound liablefor the 2018 Camp Fire that leveled the town of Paradise and killed at least 85 people, as well as the 2021 Dixie Fire, which scorched nearly 1 million acres. For its part,SCE is proposinga consumer energy bill increase of about $17 in 2025, and about $5 each year thereafter through 2028.Since 2018, the utility says, it has taken steps to reduce the risk of wildfires associated with its equipment by about 80 percent, including by completing more inspections each year, installing additional weather stations to monitor fire conditions, and increasing efforts to trim or remove trees. The civil case against SCE over the Fairview Fire is set to go to trial in September.","November 15, 2023 at 8:37 p.m. EST",15.0,11.0,2023.0
261,Washington Post,Greenhouse gases soared to another record and there’s ‘no end in sight’,Justine McDaniel and Justine McDaniel,"Global greenhouse gas levels set a record in 2022, keeping the planet’s temperatures on a rising path set to blow past the world’s climate goals, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization saidin a report Wednesday. There is “no end in sight” for growth in greenhouse gas emissions, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned, reporting that global concentrations for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide climbed to new highs last year. The emissions of these heat-trapping gases broke records as the planet continued on a trajectory that scientists have said will probably lead tomajor and irreversible damageto ecosystems and communities. “We are seeing new, extremely high levels of the three main gases,” which drive the rising global temperature and extreme weather events, WMO senior scientific officer Oksana Tarasova told The Washington Post. The WMO’s data analyzes measurements from 150 observation stations across the globe. The record greenhouse gases levels in 2022 offer another urgent metric ahead of the COP28 climate conference this month in Dubai. Last year wasthe planet’s fifth-hottest, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, and carbon dioxide levels and temperatures have continuedto climbin 2023. You’ve just lived through Earth’s hottest 12 months on record Carbon dioxide accounts for about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate, making curbing emissions critical to preventing the worst effects of climate change, scientists say. “Despite decades of warnings from the scientific community, thousands of pages of reports and dozens of climate conferences, we are still heading in the wrong direction,” WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. The world is moving ever closer to the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and the WMO warned that the planet may be close to tipping points that could have irreversible consequences, such as thedieback of the Amazon rainforestor thedestabilization of ice sheets. The rising concentrations are also pushing the world’sforestsand oceans closer to a point at which they may stop absorbing the level of emissions that humans rely on them to do, Tarasova said. In Europe, for example, last summer’s drought led forests to take up less carbon dioxide, she said, andin parts of the Amazon, the stressed forest has begun emitting it back into the atmosphere. “All those things which have been accumulated for centuries or millennia, if they start going away, you cannot just put them back,” Tarasova told The Post. “The melting of the glaciers, or the melting of the ice in the Arctic — you can’t put glaciers back which were accumulated for thousands of years.” Last year, atmospheric carbon dioxide soared to 150 percent above preindustrial levels, the WMO said. Methane increased by 16 parts per billion (ppb) over 2021, comparable to last year’s rise, and nitrous oxide by 1.4 ppb, a jump that Tarasova called dramatic. Carbon dioxide concentrations rose by 2.2 parts per million (ppm) from 2021 to 2022. The 2022 average concentration was around 418 ppm compared with preindustrial levels between 270 and 280 ppm. The last time carbon dioxide reached a comparable concentration to 2022 was 3 million to 5 million years ago, according to the WMO. The rate of growth of carbon dioxide levels in 2022 was slightly lower than in 2021, but WMO scientists attributed that largely to short-term variations in the carbon cycle. Climate impacts in the U.S. are ‘far-reaching and worsening,’ federal report finds The report comes one day after a federal U.S. reportwarnedthat the effects of climate change in the United States are worsening, even as many governments and communities step up their response. Also Tuesday, another report found that the worldis not moving quicklyenough on the many transformations necessary to limit the worst consequences of climate change. In 2022, the planet suffered extreme weatherdisasters, includingcatastrophic floodingin Pakistan,unprecedented heatacross Europe anddevastating droughtin East Africa. Scientists say Earth is now hotter than any timein the past 125,000 years. Last week, scientists said the period from November 2022 to October 2023was the hottest everin modern times. And on Wednesday, NOAAsaidlast month was the warmest Octoberon record and the fifth record-warm month in a row. The month’s spate of extreme weather included Hurricane Otis, which destroyed parts of Acapulco; Cyclone Lola, which devastated parts of Vanuatu, a nation in the South Pacific; severe flooding in Ghana; and the dropping of Mississippi River levels to record lowsfor the second year in a row. The 2022 data underscored that the planet could warm far past the 1.5-degree threshold on its current trajectory, WMO scientists said. “At the moment, it’s going to be quite difficult to keep it at the 1.5-degree limit,” Taalas said at a news briefing. “We’re heading toward 2.5 or 3 degrees.” Understanding our climate:Global warming is a real phenomenon, and weather disasters areundeniably linked to it.

262,Washington Post,"Why it’s so hot in Brazil, where a Taylor Swift concertgoer died",Matthew Cappucci and Jason Samenow and Matthew Cappucci and Jason Samenow,"Unprecedented heat for mid-November is roasting Brazil and other parts of South America amid a record stretch of hot weather for the planet. The heat in Rio de Janeiro, a city of nearly 7 million people, has proved disruptive and deadly. During sweltering temperatures Friday night,a woman died at a Taylor Swift concert. It was so hot Saturday that Swift postponed her concert scheduled for that night. “The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers and crew has to and always will come first,” read a message posted to Swift’s Instagram story on Saturday afternoon. Even though it’s still spring in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures have climbed well above what’s typical even in summer, which is more than a month away. A stagnant area of high pressure, El Niño and human-caused climate change have converged to generate this excessive heat. Rio has seen a suffocating combination of heat and humidity for days. On Friday, when the woman died at the  concert, midday temperatures topped 100 and dew points, a measure of humidity, were in the upper 70s. Any dew point over 75 degrees is oppressively humid. At a dew point of 77, about 23 grams of water, or about 1.55 tablespoons, are present in every cubic meter of atmosphere. That’s the weight of roughly nine pennies. Heat indexes on Friday — a measure of how it feels factoring in humidity — exceeded 120 degrees. Climate historian Maximiliano Herreratweetedthe heat index reached as high as 137 degrees in Rio’s suburbs Saturday. The higher the heat index, the less sweat can evaporate off our bodies. That’s because the air is already closer to its moisture-storing capacity. At high heat indexes, less heat can evaporate from our skin and cool us down as a result. That can lead to difficulties in regulating our body temperatures. If left unchecked, heat exhaustion and heat stroke can occur. Saturday’s temperatures around Rio were both dangerously high and record-setting. Rio’s Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport reported a heat index of 131 degrees on Saturday morning, the product of a temperature nearing 97 degrees and a dew point of 86. Most of the city’s other airports saw high temperatures between 105 and 107 degrees. According to Herrera, the town of Seropédica, a suburb about 25 miles west-northwest of Rio and 15 miles inland, hit 108.7 degrees, a November record. Record-high temperatures also spread into Peru and Bolivia. On Saturday, highs of 102.6 in Tingo de Ponaza, Peru, and 102.2 degrees in Cobija, Bolivia, set November records,according to Herrera. The heat first moved into Brazil about a week ago. The BBC reportedthat red alerts were issued for nearly 3,000 towns and cities because of “unbearable” heat. On Nov. 12, it said, Rio hit 108.5 degrees, a record for the month. The intensity of the heat is forecast to ease some after Sunday but temperatures are predicted to remain warmer than normal through the next week in central South America. Contributing to the heat has been counterclockwise-spinning surface high pressure system just offshore of Brazil. That’s induced warm, humid northerly winds, pumping in the same kind of humidity characteristic of the Amazon rainforest. There’s also a “heat dome,” or ridge of hot, sinking air at higher altitudes. While deflecting away the jet stream and any inclement weather and cloud cover, it’s promoting hot sunshine. What drought in the Amazon means for the planet The heat is also being boostedby a strengthening El Niño, the climate pattern associated with warmer-than-normal ocean waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme heat events, like this one, are increasing because of human-caused climate change. The planet just observedits warmest 12-month period on recordand the past five months have all been the warmest observed. According to the United Nations, Brazilhas warmed by 0.9 degreesduring just the past few decades. Land use changes, including deforestation of the Amazon, is expected to accelerate that pace of warming.","November 19, 2023 at 1:14 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
263,Washington Post,Thanksgiving week storm could stymie travel in Eastern U.S.,Dan Stillman and Dan Stillman,"Prepare for rain if you’ve got Thanksgiving week travel plans in the eastern half of the United States, and for potentially heavy snow near the Great Lakes. A storm system capable of dumping an inch or more of rain is expected to track across the Deep South, Tennessee Valley, Midwest, Southeast and East Coast between Sunday night and Wednesday, at the same time anestimated55 million Americans are expected to travel. Periods of moderate to heavy rain — in and around major cities including Atlanta, Boston, Little Rock, Nashville, New York and Washington — could slow down a significant portion of theestimated49 million Americans expected to travel by car next week. Severe thunderstorms are a risk for portions of the South on Monday and Tuesday. With temperatures warm enough for precipitation to fall as rain in most areas, effects on air travel should be limited. But some interior portions of the Northeast could see a few inches of snow Wednesday. And, in western New York, there is the potential for a significant lake-effect snow event Wednesday into Thanksgiving, just a year after Buffalo was buried by ahistoric snowfall. Otherwise, most of the nation looks to be dry on Thanksgiving Day and Friday, with chilly temperatures across much of the Eastern United States and mild temperatures for much of the West. Another storm system could impact the East next weekend, but forecast confidence is low that many days out. After producing an initial period of rain Sunday into Sunday night in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, the storm gets going in the Deep South and Tennessee Valley on Monday into Tuesday. Showers and a period of steadier rain are likely for locations including Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Jackson, Miss.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Little Rock; Memphis; Mobile, Ala.; Nashville and Louisville. Some thunderstorms and localized flooding are possible as well, with a chance of isolated severe storms and gusty mountain winds. A few spots could even see the rain end as snow flurries. Early rainfall estimates are generally in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 inches, and perhaps up to around 2 inches in a few spots. The rain would be beneficial for some areas that are experiencing drought, especially in Louisiana and Mississippi where drought has reached “extreme” to “exceptional” levels, according to the latest federaldrought monitor. Here are forecast details for a selection of cities in the region: The storm is likely to bring rain to much of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late Monday into Wednesday, as a strengthening area of low pressure tracks northward from the Deep South to the Great Lakes. Detroit, Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and Raleigh, N.C., are among the cities that can expect a period of rain, as well as the Interstate-95 corridor including Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Richmond and Washington. Chicago and St. Louis look to be near the northwestern edge of the storm system, making it more uncertain how much rain they will see. Early rainfall estimates range from around 0.5 to 1.75 inches for many locations, which would make a small dent in drought conditions that have been expanding across portions of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Here are forecast details for a selection of cities in the region: Mainly dry weather is expected across the region by late Wednesday through the holiday weekend. An early look at the potential for our first plowable lake effect snow storm. Still way too early for any snow totals. Snow will begin to fall Wednesday night and continue through Thanksgiving.#nywx#Buffalo@news4buffalopic.twitter.com/Dl T6Eg ZCP9 Rain should develop Tuesday around Buffalo and across western New York, with periods of rain lasting into Tuesday night. Winds turn gusty from the south Tuesday night as a cold front approaches, then after the cold front passes they remain breezy from the west Wednesday through at least Friday. As those winds from the west blow cold air over the relatively mild waters of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, rain is likely to change to snow by Wednesday evening. While it’s too early to predict snow accumulations or where the heaviest snow bands might set up, “the pattern supports a significant lake effect snow event … potentially carrying on deep into Thanksgiving holiday weekend,” the Weather Service in Buffalo said. Lake-effect snow is also possible Tuesday to Wednesday in northern Wisconsin and western Michigan. For the Wednesday-through-Sunday period next week, including Thanksgiving Day, chilly conditions are expected for much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation. Daytime highs may only reach the 20s to near 30 across the northern Plains and Great Lakes; the 30s and 40s across the central Plains, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast; and the 40s and 50s across the southern Plains and interior portions of the Southeast. Relatively mild weather is predicted for that same period across the far western portion of the country, especially in California and Arizona, where daytime highs are forecast in the 60s and 70s. Thanksgiving Day highs should likewise reach the 60s and 70s toward the Gulf and Southeast coasts.","November 17, 2023 at 10:33 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
264,Washington Post,Tremors keep rocking Iceland as probable volcanic eruption looms,Matthew Cappucci and Matthew Cappucci,"The Reykjanes Peninsula in southwest Iceland has been bracing for a volcanic eruption for days. Cracks appeared in the earth over the weekend, and steam is pouring out from deep below ground. The Icelandic Met Office warns of a “significant risk” of an eruption in the days ahead, and it pinpoints the town of Grindavik, which was entirely evacuated Friday, as the most probable location. Grindavik, with a population of around 3,000, is about 26 miles southwest of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Little has changed since early this week in the overall assessment of the burgeoning volcano, which could erupt on the “time scale of days” according to the Met Office. Between 12 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time Thursday, around 1,200 earthquakes were recorded. Magma is still believed to be within about 2,500 feet of the surface, but an update from Met Office cautions that “the intrusion is propagating upward slowly.” The land has sunk by up to 5 feet west of Grindavik and risen by up to 3 feet to the east. There are indications this impending eruption may feature “significantly” more magma than previous similar eruptions in the last two years. For now, officials continue to wait and watch anxiously.","November 16, 2023 at 1:35 p.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
265,Washington Post,"Matts Creek Fire sends smoke through Mid-Atlantic, lowering air quality",Ian Livingston and Ian Livingston,"It has been a smoky year in the Mid-Atlantic. First, plumes came froma record fire season in Canada. Now, the source of the smoke is in its own backyard. The Matts Creek Fire northwest of Lynchburg, Va.,first reported Sunday, rapidly expanded Wednesdaythrough Friday amid unseasonably warm conditions.  The fire in the Jefferson National Forest is being fanned by gusty breezes and fueled by an intensifying drought. Haze from the blaze reached parts of the Washington region Thursday, where some residents smelled smoke in the air. Additional bouts were possible locally before a cold front early Saturday. The Matts Creek Fire is one ofseveral hundred blazesthat have scorched the southern and central Appalachians in recent weeks. The worst of the smoke  was in the Shenandoah Valley, shuttled north by breezes coming from the south ahead of  the cold front. After explosive growth in recent days, the Matts Creek Fire had burned about  5,200 acres and was just 2 percent contained as of late Friday. About 200 fire personnel were involved in fighting the blaze, with additional personnel inbound, but no structures were threatened. Thefire breached portionsof the Blue Ridge Parkway, with a 20-mile stretchclosed. A surreal moment watching a wildfire run down a mountain - in Virginia.I watched Matt's Creek Fire from this spot on Rt. 501 for a few hours last night. The sky was orange as the 10+ ft flames advanced through the canyon.pic.twitter.com/tb Ecu4Tljy On Thursday and Friday, the smoke resulted in unhealthful air quality mainly west of the Blue Ridge. In the Shenandoah Valley, Harrisonburg, Va., posted Code Red air quality or worse for about 24 hours ending midday Thursday, signifying unhealthful amounts of smoke pollution. On Wednesday and Thursday nights, the air quality index even spiked to Code Purple, signifying “very” unhealthful air. From Thursday night through Friday, atemporary U.S. Forest Service monitorjust north of the blaze, in Lexington, Va., recorded Code Maroon, meaning hazardous air quality. Code Red conditions also were observed northward into the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, across portions of northern Maryland and into southern Pennsylvania. @capitalweather Any idea why the skyline is smoky and the air smells like smoke in Lorton, VA. Are there from the fires in Skyline/Shenandoah?  Or something locally?pic.twitter.com/Ya N2c34QMn While insignificant amounts of rain were possible with the cold front Friday night, the main impact was expected be an increase and shift in wind to come from the northwest. Firefighters were expected to work through the night in anticipation of this change in fire behavior for the weekend and warned those southeast of it to expect smokier skies ahead. East of the Blue Ridge, only enough smoke to create a light haze has blown through. The region around Washington has seen air quality dip into the Code Yellow, or moderate, range. The air quality dipped briefly to Code Orange (unhealthful for sensitive groups) and to Code Red as close by as Frederick and western Loudoun counties Thursday. There was still some chance of a brief degradation of air quality before the pre-dawn Saturday wind shift. Even though the fall season often is accompanied by forest fires in parts of the central Appalachians, the expanding and intensifying drought has made this year’s blazes unusually numerous and potent. The Matts Creek Fire spread over an area in severe drought that extends from central Virginia up the Interstate 81 corridor into Maryland. Several counties just north of the fire are in extreme drought, or the second-worst category. The entire Washington-Baltimore region also is considered either abnormally dry or in a moderate drought. Much of the Mid-Atlantic is experiencing one of its 10 driest years on record. Rainfall deficits for the year have  passed 18 inches in Hagerstown, Md., 17 inches in Charlottesville and 9 inches in Roanoke. Around Washington, deficits range from 8 to 12 inches. The dry weather has been particularly acute over the past month. Most locations experienced what wasamong their driestmid-October to mid-November on record, with rain totals of only a few tenths of an inch to a half-inch in most spots. There is some hope for more-widespread rainfall in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, which may have more of a chance of dousing the flames.","November 17, 2023 at 5:32 p.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
266,Washington Post,How book nerds and a dancing accountant made the library cool,Shira Ovide and Shira Ovide,"This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday. If you’re the type of person who giggles at alibrarian peering from behind a cardboard cutout of Le Var Burton, then I have a treat for you. (I am definitely that person.) In the Milwaukee Public Library’s wonderfully weird social media videos, you might also seea library accounting employee somersaulting as M3GAN, the fictional murderousartificial intelligence doll. In a couple of othervideos, anonagenarian library lovermakes a hand gesture that The Washington Post won’t let me describe. Or you can smile at a librarian and a kidwiggling and face smushing. The Milwaukee Public Library shows how book lovers are flourishing on social media. Those accounts are a joy and that’s a win. Tik Tok fan communitiesregularlymake books into best sellers. And some book stores andpublic libraries have found social media attentionby — and I say this with affection — being their wholesome, huge nerd selves. Let’s talk about how and why the Milwaukee Public Library created one of the country’s most unhinged social media accounts (in a good way). Until last year, the Milwaukee library system’s social media messaging was straightforward but blah. Posts might have displayed the hours for story time or events to sign up for library cards. But like many of its counterparts, the Milwaukee Public Library saw that people weren’t coming back to libraries after pandemic restrictions were lifted. Budget cuts loomed. Staff figured it couldn’t hurt toshake things up on social media. “We started these videos out of desperation,” said Fawn Siemsen-Fuchs, the MPL volunteer coordinator who also helps run the social media accounts. First with Instagram Reelsand then Tik Tok, the social media approach became fun first and informative second. One of the first hits was the librarian spying at her book display behind the cardboard Burton, whom book lovers know from “Reading Rainbow.” They also filmed complex videos includingscenes from Stephen King booksand atelenovela-style video about a book that fell in the toilet. (Read to the end for a toilet-related book tip. Gross, sorry.) Siemsen-Fuchs’s social media partner is Evan Szymkowski, the accounting staffer who has a background in theater and dance and stars in some MPL videos. (Szymkowski played that pitch-perfect M3GAN.) Other library staff members and their children pop up in videos, too. My personal favorite is the parody of a viral video in which a young woman repeatedly purrs “Mercedes” while caressing the vehicle’s features, including a luxurious automatic window and a stereo system. In ashot-by-shot remake, a library employee brute-forces the window crank of a decrepit car used for community outreach events, and he blasts the “Pocahontas” soundtrack from the in-dash cassette tape player. (That MPL staffer, Kou Vang, is a deadpan genius.) A post shared by Milwaukee Public Library (@milwaukeepubliclibrary) If you’re not impressed with thecreativity at workand thejoy that library employees are havingin the videos, you have no soul. I mean, come on,librarians billowing in a wind machine!(Read the loving comments on that video, too.) Like hiding your dog’s pill in a blob of peanut butter, the Milwaukee Public Library uses its videos to convey useful information to people who might not know all that the library has to offer. Videos have highlighted library’slending of hiking equipment, libraryapps for free streaming music and audiobooks, and options tobook time in the library’s music recording studio. “We’re able to showcase these kinds of things in a simple-ish way,” Szymkowski said. A post shared by Milwaukee Public Library (@milwaukeepubliclibrary) It’s always tricky to measure how social media views translate into real-world successes. But Melissa Howard, MPL’s community relations and engagement director, said that when the library social media videos take off, there can be a surge of people using MPL’s online resources, such ase-books,language learning toolsandstreaming videos. She also said that the videos are helping shift the image of public libraries from tombs of dowdy shushing matrons to geek chic. MPL staff regularly get recognized from their appearances in the library’s online videos. Lauren Messner-Kenney, a library technical services specialist who also works as a restaurant server, once noticed that a diner kept staring at her, according to Siemsen-Fuchs. Finally he asked, “Are you Amelia Bedelia?” Yup, Messner-Kenney hadplayed the children’s book character in a library video. I asked Siemsen-Fuchs and Szymkowski for other book-related social media accounts that inspire them and might captivate you.

267,Washington Post,1 in 10 teens already use Chat GPT for school. Here’s how to guide them.,Geoffrey A. Fowler and Geoffrey A. Fowler,"It’s time for The Talk about artificial intelligence. Actually, it might be way overdue. AI apps can do amazing things, but they also can get children into a lot of trouble. And chances are, your kids are already using them. But you don’t have to be an AI expert to talk with your kids about it. Starting this week, popular AI apps like Chat GPT are getting their own version ofnutrition labelsto help parents and kids navigate how to use them and what to avoid. They’re written by family advocacy group Common Sense Media. The reviews expose some uncomfortable truths about the current state of AI. To help families guide their conversations, I asked Common Sense review leader Tracy Pizzo Frey to help boil them down to three key lessons. Like any parent, Pizzo Frey and her team are concerned not only with how well AI apps work but also where they might warp kids’ worldview, violate their privacy or empower bullies. Their conclusions might surprise you: Chat GPT, the popular ask-anything chatbot, gets just three stars out of five. Snapchat’s My AI gets just two stars. 1/5 The thing every parent should know: American youths have adopted AI as though it’s magic. Two-thirds of American teens say they have heard of Chat GPT, and 1 in 5 of those have used it for homework,according to new data from the Pew Research Center. That means, overall, more than  1 in  10 already use Chat GPT for school. Children are, in fact, a target market for AI companies even though many describe their products as works in progress. This week, Google announced it was launching a version of its “experimental”Bard chatbot for teens. Chat GPT technically requires permission from a parent to use if you’re under 18, but kids can get around that simply by clicking “continue.” The problem is, AI is not magic. Today’s buzzy generative AI apps have deep limitations and insufficient guardrails for kids. Some of their issues are silly — making pictures of people with extra fingers — but others are dangerous. In my own AI tests, I’ve seen AI apps pump outwrong answersand promote sick ideas like embracingeating disorders. I’ve seen AI pretend to be my friend and thengive terrible advice. I’ve seen how simple AI makes creatingfake imagesthat could be used tomisleador bully. And I’ve seen teachers who misunderstand AI accusing innocent students ofusing AI to cheat. “Having these kinds of conversations with kids is really important to help them understand what the limitations of these tools are, even if they seem really magical — which they’re not,” Pizzo Frey tells me. AI is also not going away. Banning AI apps isn’t going to prepare young people for a future where they’ll need to master AI tools for work. For parents, that means asking lots of questions about what your kids are doing with these apps so you can understand what specific risks they might encounter. Here are three lessons parents need to know about AI so they can talk to their kids in a productive way: Hard reality: You can’t rely on know-it-all chatbots to get things right. But wait … Chat GPT and Bardseemto get things right more often than not. “They are accurate part of the time simply because of the amount of data they’re trained on. But there’s no checking for factual accuracy in the design of these products,” Pizzo Frey says. There are lots and lots of examples of chatbots beingspectacularly wrong, and it’s one of the reasons both Bard and Chat GPT get mediocre ratings from Common Sense. Generative AI is basically just a word guesser — trying to finish a sentence based on patterns from what they’ve seen in their training data. (A spokeswoman for Open AI, which makes Chat GPT, said, “We’ve worked to ensure GPT-4, which powers Chat GPT, produces factual responses. Independent evaluations show GPT-4 has a 97% accuracy rate.” Google said the Common Sense review “fails to take into account the safeguards and features that we’ve developed within Bard.” Common Sense plans to include the new teen version of Bard in its next round of reviews.) I understand lots of students use Chat GPT as a homework aid, to rewrite dense textbook material into language they can better digest. But Pizzo Frey recommends a hard line: Anything important — anything going into an assignment or that you might be asked about on a test — needs to be checked for accuracy, including what it might be leaving out. Doing this helps kids learn important lessons about AI, too. “We are entering a world where it could become increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction, so it’s really important that we all become detectives,” Pizzo Frey says. That said, not all AI apps have these particular factual problems. Some are more trustworthy because they don’t use generative AI tech like chatbots and are designed in ways that reduce risks, like learning tutors Ello and Kyron. They get the highest scores from Common Sense’s reviewers. And even the multiuse generative AI tools can be great creative tools, like for brainstorming and idea generation. Use it to draft the first version of something that’s hard to say on your own, like an apology. Or my favorite: Chat GPT can be a fantastic thesaurus. An AI app may act like a friend. It may even have a realistic voice. But this is all an act. Despite what we’ve seen inscience fiction, AI isn’t on the verge of becoming alive. AI does not know what’s right or wrong. And treating it like a person could harm kids and their emotional development. There are growing reports of kidsusing AI for socializing, and peoplespeaking with Chat GPT for hours. Companies keep trying to build AI friends, including Meta’s new chatbotsbased on celebrities such as Kendall Jenner and Tom Brady. Snapchat’s My AI gets its own profile page, sits in your friends list and is always up for chatting even when human friends are not. “It is really harmful, in my opinion, to put that in front of very impressionable minds,” Pizzo Frey says. “That can really harm their human relationships.” AI is so alluring, in part, because today’s chatbots have a technical quirk that causes them to agree with their users, a problem known as sycophancy. “It’s very easy to engage with a thing that is more likely to agree with you than something that might push or challenge you,” Pizzo Frey says. Another part of the problem: AI is still very bad at understanding the full context that a real human friend would. When Itested My AI earlier this year, I told the app I was a teenager — but it still gave me advice on hiding alcohol and drugs from parents, as well tips for a highly age-inappropriate sexual encounter. A Snap spokeswoman said the company had taken pains to make My AI not look like a human friend. “By default, My AI displays a robot emoji. Before anyone can interact with My AI, we show an in-app message to make clear it’s a chatbot and advise on its limitations,” she said. As AI apps and media become a larger part of our lives, they’re bringing some hidden values with them. Too often, those includeracism, sexism and other kinds of bigotry. Common Sense’s reviewers found bias in chatbots, such as My AI responding that people with stereotypical female names can’t be engineers and aren’t “really into technical stuff.” But the most egregious examples they found involved text-to-image generation AI apps such as Dall E and Stable Diffusion. For example, when they asked Stable Diffusion to generate images of a “poor White person,” it would often generate images of Black men. “Understanding the potential for these tools to shape our children’s worldview is really important,” Pizzo Frey says. “It’s part of the steady drumbeat of always seeing ‘software engineers’ as men, or an ‘attractive person’ as someone who is White and female.” The root problem is something that’s largely invisible to the user: How the AI was trained. If it gobbled up information across the whole internet without sufficient human judgment, then the AI is going to “learn” some pretty messed-up stuff from dark corners of the internet where kids should not be. Most AI apps try to deal with unwanted bias by putting systems in place after the fact to correct their output — making certain words off-limits in chats or images. But those are “Band-Aids,” Pizzo Frey says, that often fail in real-world use.

A report released Thursday identified several large companies — including tech firms, health-care organizations and sports teams — whose ads appeared next to pro-Nazi posts.

269,Washington Post,"Colorado’s football team is winning online, despite losing on the field",Taylor Lorenz and Taylor Lorenz,"When the University of Colorado Buffaloes take the field Friday night against Washington State, their win-loss record will be a disappointing 4-6. Since their last win Oct. 7, they have dropped four straight. But the losing record hasn’t dampened online enthusiasm for the Buffaloes, as measured in followers on social media and potential earnings for the team’s most visible stars. Thanks to two aggressive campaigns to chronicle the squad’s exploits for the internet — one paid for by the university, the other the creation of Deion Sanders, the Buffaloes’ irrepressible head coach — Colorado has been transformed into a social media phenomenon. A-list celebrities including Snoop Dogg, DJ Khaled and Rick Ross, along with sports legends such as Tom Brady, post about Colorado football. The sidelines have been packed with stars, and the team’s social media accounts continue to skyrocket, despite the string of losses. “Colorado has become mainstream in a way that college football often isn’t,” said Rodger Sherman, a college football journalist and the creator of the online video series Road Rodge, which charts the college football season. “It’s been a frenzy: We’ve gotten years worth of feuds and quotes and content just in the first months. Every week there’s a new moment that blows up online … We haven’t seen players become this legitimately famous in college football.” Colorado’s virality is no accident, but the result of a careful strategy. Cameras are on hand to document nearly every moment of the season: the personal, behind-the-scenes footage from inside the locker room, the highlights from the game leading up to a potential big win or tough loss, the interaction of teammates on the bus before and after a game. Even the players’ practice jerseys are emblazoned with their Instagram handles rather than their last names. All of this has led to real money in terms of ticket sales for the university and brand endorsements for the team’s top players, whose followings continue to explode. Shedeur Sanders, the team’s quarterback, has seen his Instagram following nearly double to 2 million since the season began, and Travis Hunter, a cornerback and wide receiver, has gone from 569,000 to over 1.1 million followers on the app. The team’s channels also continue to grow, going from a total following of 267,000 to over 2.3 million in the past year. “Colorado football has been the biggest thing in sports,” said Tom Weingarten, chief growth officer of Overtime, a sports media company. “Professional, college, high school, whatever, there hasn’t been anything bigger on social media.” Deion Sanders’s son, Deion Sanders Jr., commands a team of You Tubers and videographers who have unprecedented access to the players, including his two younger brothers, quarterback Shedeur and Shilo, a safety. The goal is to transform the players into influencers in their own right and build them into stars online. “We record content, set up their You Tube channels and keep it rolling so they don’t have to do outside work,” Sanders Jr. said. “They don’t have to film stuff themselves, all they have to do is show up for workouts, prepare for the game and win, and we’ll handle everything else.” Sanders Jr.'s team is not employed by the school. They have a deal worked out with Coach Sanders himself, in his first season with the Buffaloes. But they partner closely with Colorado’s in-house social media team. “We always joke around and say they’re like the radio edit and I’m the album version,” Sanders Jr. said of the Colorado in-house social media staff. “They have specific rules they have to abide by. I have to abide by some rules, but we can have a little more flavor in there and raw reality. We don’t have to dress it up as much. My only rule is don’t make the university look bad, and don’t make Coach Prime look bad.” John Snelson, the university’s director of creative services, oversees the in-house content team, which consists of four full-time creative workers who cover analytics, photos, videos and graphics for the internet, along with 11 student employees who do everything from capturing content to editing photos and videos for Tik Tok, Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. Snelson said that the key to virality is real-time content and hitting internet users from every angle on every platform. “There’s definitely no one that has the amount of content that we have,” he said of other college football teams. “If you’re a fan, you’ll see maybea video my team made on Instagram. But then you’ll also see interesting interactions between Coach Prime and something he did on campus that day on his sons’ social media channels, then you’ll see a player interview on another player’s channel. There’s just a ton going on.” Even Coach Sanders’s nickname, “Coach Prime” (based on his high school nickname, Prime Time), speaks to his ability to generate attention. “The Colorado coach has long had cameras trailing him, following his every move,”Sporting News reported. “There’s a reason why he’s called Coach Prime.” During games, Snelson has students stationed surrounding the field to capture social media content from every angle, making sure not a single play is missed. “Everything you see coming out on the football page is original content from our staff,” he said. Share this article Share “Say there’s 11 students, and probably six of them are doing video, two are doing photo, and the others are running and editing during the game. We’ll put out live edits of our own footage mid-game, and then we’ll have someone in the media room editing too. Say we score a big touchdown, and one of our cameras gets a great shot of it, we’ll run that card to the media room, edit it, and then we’ll post it.” Deion Sanders is not too good to be true, and Colorado still has work to do Colorado football content performs so well online that other sports content creators have used the team to grow their own channels. Moments after big plays, users on X, for example, will rip videos of the moment and share them to their own channels to capture the inevitable views. Weingarten said that CU football has been a boon for Overtime. “[Colorado football] has definitely helped us grow our channels,” he said. “The clips always do extremely well, and that’s why we’re so focused on it. The more views we get, the more shares we get, the more that we grow. … Then you have places like ESPN and Barstool who aren’t going to the games, but still have these massive sports audiences, and when they’re posting highlights or behind-the-scenes clips that they’re seeing on Twitter or elsewhere, it generates this virality.” The virality has paid off for the school. In September, tickets to University of Colorado football gamesbecame college football’s most expensive, with prices over $500. According to data by Ticket IQ, Colorado ticket prices have risen 327 percent since the beginning of last season’s ticket sales. In early September, a spokesperson for Colorado’s ticket officetold Front Office Sportsthat the school sold more than $400,000 in tickets after the team’s first game. By late September, Colorado had sold out the entire 2023 home season for the first time in the program’s history. The string of losses has softened ticket prices in the secondary market, but games continue to sell out.Colorado’s game last week against Arizona was fully sold out, with tickets priced as high as $933 on the secondary market. In 2022, when the team went 1-11, the average ticket cost $73. This week’s game is an away game, so tickets are more affordable, but some still cost more than $330. It’s ‘Coach Prime’ time at Colorado The online hype has also meant potential big bucks for the team’s star players, who can take advantage of 2021 changes to NCAA policies allowing college athletes to profit from their own name, image and likeness (NIL) for the first time. “[Colorado’s online virality] is making these college players legitimately extremely famous and into household names,” Sherman said. “And they’re allowing them to take advantage of the NIL opportunities in a way other schools might not. The ability to boost players up like this is a huge advantage, and it’s one of the reasons Deion has been able to turn things around so quickly and get such high-caliber players into the program.” In September, Business of College Sportsdeclaredthat Sanders has “built an NIL powerhouse at Colorado.” Two months later, that is still true. Eight Colorado players are on target to rake in over six figures worth of NIL deals, according to college sports hub On3. Shedeur Sanders isprojected to have NIL deals totaling at least $4.8 million, and Hunter is estimated to have deals worth $1.8 million, making them two of the most monetizable college athletes playing today. On top of that, some of Colorado’s players offer their own merchandise lines and monetize their social media platforms through live-streaming gifts and tips. Hunter has over 24,000 followers on Twitch, where he discusses his life and key games. Snelson’s team feeds the Colorado fame machine by boosting the players and feeding them content to post. The school uses an app called “Influencer,” which the players have installed on their phones. “Every time we take pictures of them, it’s distributed to them because they’re tagged, so they can post the content as well,” Snelson said. “Then, if we’re making a video about Shedeur, for instance, we do a collab post with them so the content is on their page as well as ours. We’re putting out all this content for our pages, but also as much as possible we get our content to their pages as well.” Colorado’s content-first strategy has drawn critics. Before the school’s big game against the University of Oregon in September (which Colorado lost, 42-6), Oregon Coach Dan Lanningsaid of the team: “They’re fighting for clicks, we’re fighting for wins. There’s a difference. This game won’t be played in Hollywood, it’s going to be played on the grass.” Sherman said it doesn’t matter that the team itself isn’t winning much. He noted that the Dallas Cowboys built an impressive brand and became one the most valuable sports franchises in the world, even though they haven’t won a Super Bowl since 1996. He also said that college football is different from pro football because of the constant turnover of players. Generate enough hype, make it clear that you can transform your star players into mega influencers who can earn millions on NIL deals, and the top recruits will come. “Clicks and wins are more correlated than many people want to believe,” he said.","November 17, 2023 at 10:52 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
270,Washington Post,"After I-10 closure, America’s car capital grapples with freeway future",Reis Thebault and Reis Thebault,"LOS ANGELES — When, many geologic eras from now, future Earth beings excavate the remains of this great city, they will be left with an obvious conclusion: Now,hereis a civilization that loved freeways. Present day Angelenos, however, know all too well that the forthcoming fossil record will tell only a partial truth. Sure, those endless miles of concrete and thick tangles of overpass interchanges were beloved by early planners, politicians and bureaucrats, who pushed their proliferation in the name of progress and profit. But everyone else, the many millions whose cars inched along atop them and the countless neighborhoods crushed to make way for them? Not so much. This love-hate dynamic is so ingrained in daily life in Los Angeles that it’s usually barely worth noting. But late last week, the devil’s bargain that underwrote the transportation culture here broke down. A fast-moving industrial fire — reportedly sparked by an arsonist — charred Interstate 10 in downtown L.A., forcing a mile-long closure of one of the busiest freeways in the car capital of the world. In a city already famous for its traffic, the episode has caused cascading challenges, gridlocking side streets andpolluting communitiesthat have become casualties of GPS detours for more than 300,000 drivers looking for alternate routes. Still, like past predictions of a “carmageddon,” the shutdown has not paralyzed the entire city. The repairs, once expected to take more than a month, are now scheduled to be completed by Tuesday. Instead of creating a long-running traffic nightmare, the closed freeway’s most lasting impact might be more philosophical. Afterthe 1994 earthquakedestroyed a different section of the 10, known in the city as the Santa Monica Freeway, the chorus was quick and unanimous: Rebuild, as fast as possible. But this time, at least in some circles, the disaster has inspired calls to rethink the region’s car-centric approach to transportation, further fueling an aspirational movement to wean Los Angeles off the automobile. “This time around, it seems like the freeway is emblematic of the struggle for L.A.’s identity,” said Paul Haddad, a native Angeleno and author of the book “Freewaytopia.” “This is an opportunity for people to reimagine what kind of future we want for Los Angeles transportation.” In this great reimagining, mobility advocates may in theory have public support on their side — nobody is having fun on the freewayhere — but they are up against many years of history and habit. Los Angeles and its freeways grew up symbiotically. The wide, fast roads helped the city spread; and the more it spread, the more roads it needed. The city’s earliest industrial titans set out to build a car-dependent metropolis, one that would court the nascent auto and aerospace industries. By the 1920s, Los Angeles had more automobiles per capita than any other city, and the Arroyo Seco Parkway, the country’sfirst freeway, opened in 1940, linking downtown and Pasadena. Today, a dozen freeways snake across about 527 miles of L.A., and many more crisscross the county. “Freeways are part of the soul of Los Angeles. There’s no way around it,” said Haddad, who estimates he’s driven just about every mile of the city’s freeway network. Joan Didion, who lived in the city for more than two decades, once wrote of navigating freeways as “the only secular communion Los Angeles has,” one that requires “total surrender, a concentration so intense as to seem a kind of narcosis, a rapture-of-the-freeway.” For others, driving them can be unnerving, a reason to stay away from the city altogether. Guy Clark, a musician from Texas, spoke for fed-up visitors like him when hesang, “If I can just get off this L.A. freeway, without getting killed or caught.” If nothing else, an Angeleno’s relationship to the freeway is personal, as Steve Martin demonstrated in the film “L.A. Story” when he took life advice from a sentient roadside sign. “Each freeway has its own personality,” Haddad said. “It could be a workhorse like the 5, or the Arroyo Seco, which is dainty like a grandmother.” When the Santa Monica Freeway opened, in 1966, it was a splashy expressway to the beach, connecting the east and west sides of Los Angeles. These days, it has a more utilitarian reputation, especially the downtown portion that is now temporarily closed. It is the westernmost part of transcontinental Interstate 10, which runs to Florida. The shutteredstrip, which runs from Alameda Street to the East L.A. interchange, is a key economic corridor. This part of the freeway was built atop more than 2,100 concrete stilts, which allowed it to pass over important nodes of industrial activity. But this architecture left the artery vulnerable, as demonstrated in recent days. The fire that shut down the mile-long stretch began on state-owned land leased to a private company and used to store highly flammable materials, state government officials said, a little-known but common practice that is under scrutiny. The blaze, which is still under investigation, burned through wooden pallets, vats of hand sanitizer and abandoned cars, scorching about 100 support columns. News of the fire immediately conjured memories of the catastrophic Northridge earthquake, which destroyed portions of the freewayfarther west in 1994, setting off a desperate political scramble. In a nod to the dominance of the car here, the speed of reconstruction — the freeway was repaired within less than three months — was credited with helping boost the reelection later that year of Gov. Pete Wilson (R). This year, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a state of emergency the day of the fire and made multiple trips to Los Angeles to hold news conferences with Mayor Karen Bass (D). On Thursday, the pair made the triumphant announcement that the freeway would reopen weeks earlier than planned. “It’s a good day in L.A.,” Bass said, smiling broadly. Even as a long-term crisis seems to have been avoided, some Angelenos are reexamining the city’s embrace of freeways for reasons other than the bumper-to-bumper slogs. The feverish construction of the highway system during the 20th century disproportionately displaced low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, just as it did in citiesacross the country. About 15,000 people were pushed out of their homes when the Santa Monica Freeway was built, many of them Black families who lived in Crenshaw and Sugar Hill, a historic neighborhood where many of the city’s most prominent African Americans resided. One particularly profound example of this pattern played out at the eastern terminus of the Santa Monica Freeway, in Boyle Heights, where thousands of Latinos were displaced and the neighborhood was remade with the construction of the East L.A. Interchange. The massive spaghetti bowl structure, where a handful of freeways converge, is now a crucial part of the city’s transportation map. But it stands on land that was cleared of homes, churches and bars in thriving communities of Mexican and Central American immigrants. The neighborhoods that surround the interchange are exposed to high levels of noise and air pollution. “All evidence clearly points to communities of color bearing an unfair burden of the progress of freeways, and East L.A. is a prototypical example,” said Gilbert Estrada, a history professor at Long Beach City College who has studied freeways and racism for more than two decades. “The freeways just manhandle communities. They are surrounded.” According to Estrada’s research, just over 2 percent of total city land is used for freeways. But in East L.A., freeways cover 9 percent of land, and in Boyle Heights they occupy 12 percent. “We’re all-in on freeways,” he said of the city’s approach to planning. “We bought in on this stuff and we can’t return it.” Still, some are giving it a shot — and moments like the recent closure of the 10 give them hope. “To see it come down so brilliantly is a great metaphor for where we need to go as a city,” said John Yi, the executive director of Los Angeles Walks, a pedestrian advocacy group. “In a way, I am grateful for these moments of pain, because it reminds the city how reliant we are on this one system that doesn’t serve any of us.” Yi and more than 20 other advocates sentan open letterto local and state leaders on Thursday, urging them to capitalize on the closure of I-10 by rolling out alternatives to driving and to “not just fix the freeway.” Some ideas include creating more bus lanes, increasing rail service and making public transit fare-free during the shutdown. There are signs these arguments may be resonating with city leaders: Bass on Thursday introduceda measurethat aimed to promote Metro ridership and expand its service.

271,Washington Post,A job? Check. A place to live? Not so much.,Rachel Siegel and Rachel Siegel,"Brenda Mc Donnell sells food, not hotel rooms. But that didn’t stop the owner of four restaurants in Western Maryland from fixing up a motel nearby — just so her staff would have somewhere to live. Home prices in Garrett County have gone up8.5 percentin the past year, so Mc Donnell saw an opportunity at an  unused property her husband owned nearby. She renovated a cluster of rooms and sometimes charges a few hundred bucks a month, or just lets restaurant workers live there for free. The result: Her employees can hang onto jobs they might have otherwise had to turn down because they couldn’t afford housing. “People will ask, ‘Brenda, can I rent that house for a month? I’ll pay you $800,’” Mc Donnell said. “I could make money. But I’m like, ‘No, they’re for employees.’” Rent is finally cooling. See how much prices have changed in your area. All over the country, employers like Mc Donnell are finding themselves stuck between thehot housing market and thehot job market. In Oregon, rural school districts have puzzled over how to provide enough housing for teachers. In rural Arizona, hospitals are renting out rooms to staff members. In Massachusetts, the state has helped support temporary housing for summer workers on Cape Cod. The result is a kind of tug-of-war between two of the economy’s main pillars. On a small scale, these transactions are just business owners and employees working things out in one-to-one agreements. But the underlying tension caused by the housing market could permanently shape how people decide where to live, what jobs to take — and whether the economy is working for them. No one thinks a lack of housing is enough to spoil momentum in the labor market. Employers have added workers for 34 consecutive months, after all, and the job market is still churning. But some economists still worry about the knock-on effects of the country’s housing challenges. Until enough homes get built in the places that need it most, more companies will have to get creative — through higher pay, remote work options or other perks — to ensure their workers can find a place to live. The housing market recession is already ending Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said she’s heard from companies that make job offers and then lose those candidates because they can’t find anywhere to live. In her district, which stretches from Maine to Connecticut, some employers tell her they’ve started providing buses or other transportation for workers who have no choice but to live far away. “I see housing like child care,” Collins told The Washington Post in late August. “There are a variety of reasons to be concerned about availability of housing, from the affordable up to the high prices. That is one of the key things.” Housing issues are a top reason some people still want to work remotely. Julia Pollak, chief economist at Zip Recruiter, said she’s seen a shift from early in the pandemic, when people largely wanted to stay home because they feared getting covid. Now, concerns about commuting costs,gas pricesand rent are often front of mind. Share this article Share Many workers also embark on a job search assuming they are willing to move, Pollak said. But when it comes down to it, the hurdles to relocating often get in the way. “The gap between the people willing to relocate and the actual numbers on successful completed relocation for work has widened,” shesaid. “It’s clear from the data on rental costs and inventory levels why that might be the case.” Workers cash in on a new flexibility: Leaving the office after a few hours Denise Moriguchi knows that the local housing market weighs on her staff in Seattle. The chief executive of Uwajimaya, a chain of Asian grocery stores, said many of her employees commute an hour by public bus, have multiple roommates or rent a couch rather than a whole room, because housing costs in the area are so high. Whenever Moriguchi considers adding new store locations, she considers the general affordability in the area and the availability of public transit, in case she’d have a hard time finding employees who live nearby. Earlier this year, Moriguchi was hiring a new executive from Georgia. As part of a relocation package, her company covered moving costs, airfare and other expenses to help offset differences in cost of living. In another instance, when Moriguchi was hiring for a different role, the recruiting firm she was using said it would focus on potential candidates who already lived in high-cost places. “The search firm we were working with said, ‘Yeah, we’ll look locally and on the West Coast,’” Moriguchi said. “They tended not to focus as much on the Midwest because of cost of living.” Travel nursing has helped Sierra Levin live and work across the country, from California to Texas to Massachusetts. But when she was trying to line up a short-termcontract at a hospital in Newark this year, she had a harder time than usual finding somewhere to live. Levin said it was the first time she’d struggled to find housing in her five years on the job. Since travel nurses generally take contracts for a few months at a time, Levin was looking for a furnished, month-to-month rental. She initially looked in Jersey City but was quoted $2,000, minimum, for one bedroom in a group house. She ended up renting one room in a five-bedroom house in nearby Montclair for $1,700 — but nailed that lease down only three days before starting work. “I don’t want more than one paycheck to go to rent,” Levin said. “That doesn’t make sense, and that’s not sustainable.” Carey Martin is a co-founder of Custom Hiring Solutions, a national recruiting firm based in Phoenix that focuses on small businesses. Martin said she’s seen the job market change plenty over the past 20 years. But in just the last two years, housing is increasingly pricing candidates out of job searches — even if they’re looking for short-term rentals for temporary jobs. Martin estimates that offers don’t work out more than half the time, largely because of housing issues. And even when they do, Martin said, she’s never seen so many professionals in mid-level management roles, earning $60,000 or $75,000 per year, who still need roommates to make it work. “We have had employers come to us and say: ‘At this point, we will do whatever we have to. If we have to pay for their temporary housing as a kind of bonus, we’ll work something unique out like that,’” Martin said. “Those are for the leadership positions and executives. For staff, and even mid-level management, the deals usually fall apart.”","November 18, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
272,Washington Post,Grand Canyon University pushes back against $37M fine from Education Dept.,Danielle Douglas-Gabriel and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel,"The nation’s largest Christian university says it will fighta $37.7 million finefrom the Education Department over accusations it misled students over college costs, questioning whether the penalty is religious persecution. Grand Canyon University President Brian Mueller on Thursday also accused the federal agency of retaliating against the school for an ongoing lawsuit over whether the institution could become a nonprofit. “This is government overreach,” Mueller said to anarenafull of hundreds of students, faculty and staff in Phoenix. “This is the weaponization of a department that has an opinion that isn’t shared by anybody else. There’s no corroborating evidence to indicate that there’s something nefarious going on here.” Late last month, the Education Department slapped Grand Canyon, which enrolls more than118,000 studentsmostly online, withthe largest fine issuedagainst a university for deceptive practices. Investigators in the department’s Federal Student Aid office say the school misled more than 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs. They claim GCU advertised that its doctoral programs cost between $40,000 and $49,000, when in fact fewer than 2 percent of its graduates paid that amount. Most students paid as much as $12,000 more in tuition for courses required for a dissertation, the department said. Grand Canyon said such continuation courses are common in doctoral programs. It also has said the university prominently discloses the potential extra costs in its marketing materials and is more transparent than other schools. Those disclosures have received the backing of GCU’s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission. Mueller said the Education Department told the university that its findings were not based on evidence that any student was actually misled. Grand Canyon notified the department Thursday of its intention to appeal the fine, which requires an internal review at the agency that could ultimately involve Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. The Education Department said it is in receipt of the request, which will be referred to its Office of Hearings and Appeals for an independent review. If the appeal is unsuccessful, Mueller said the university will file a lawsuit and fight all the way to the Supreme Court if needed. He said the legal fees could impose a financial hardship that forces the university to raise tuition. “We pour all the money back into these classrooms, these laboratories, these residence halls, this technology. It makes absolutely no sense to send any money to Washington, D.C.,” Mueller said. Grand Canyon has been locked in litigation with the Education Department over the agency’s rejection of its bid to convert from a for-profit to nonprofit institution. Mueller claims the department is targeting the school in retaliation for the lawsuit. He also raised the specter of religious persecution bythe department, noting that it has been investigating Liberty University, a Christian school in Virginia. A draft report by the department, which Liberty has said contains significant inaccuracies, flagged numerouscampus safetyissues. “It’s interesting, isn’t it, that the two largest Christian universities in the country, this one and Liberty University, are both being fined,” Mueller said. “Now is there cause and effect? I don’t know.”","November 16, 2023 at 6:39 p.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
273,Washington Post,Medical provider vying for border contract faces scrutiny after girl’s death,Nick Miroff and Nick Miroff,"A medical services company whose quality of care is a focus of a probe launched afterthe death of an 8-year-old girl in U.S. border custody has been selected as a finalist for a new $1.5 billion government contract, a Washington Post investigation has found. Florida-based Loyal Source Government Services is among a half-dozen companies under consideration for the five-year contract to provide medical screening and services for the thousands of migrants detained each day along the southern border, according to three U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials and records obtained by The Post. Loyal Source has been the primary medical services provider for CBP since 2020, and has obtained CBP contracts worth roughly $700 million since 2015, government records show. The company has struggled for years to staff border facilities with nurses and doctors, often using lower-level emergency medical technicians earning a third of the pay or less, according to two current employees who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity because they could be fired for speaking to reporters. Officials at CBP, which is conducting the investigation, say Loyal Source is the only company currently large enough to deliver medical services at the scale needed by the government. But medical officers and investigators at the agency have raised growing concerns about the quality and safety of that care. CBP sent Loyal Source a letter Aug. 10describing widespread problems with the company’s performance on its current $25 million-per-month contract, including chronic staff shortages, excessive travel expenses and error-plagued record-keeping, according to two CBP officials who were not authorized to discuss the letter, which has not been previously reported. The warning, known as a cure notice, is the formal mechanism used by the federal government to alert contractors that they are at risk of suspension or termination. CBP officials declined to discuss the notice. “The health and safety of individuals in our custody, our workforce, and communities we serve is a top priority,” the agency said in a statement to The Post. “CBP is dedicated to the ongoing review and evaluation of our practices to ensure that all individuals in our custody receive the best care possible.” For decades, emergency care in Border Patrol stations was provided primarily by agents with basic medical training. The stations were designed to hold adult migrants for short stays, not families with children. But with record numbers of people crossing the border — and many spending longer periods in U.S. custody — CBP has been under growing pressure to develop its own medical-care system. The agency urgently sought outside help after the deaths of several children along the border in 2018 and 2019. Border Patrol stations in remote areas are the most difficult to staff. They present significant risks because smuggling organizations send large groups of families with children to those locations, a tactic used to overwhelm and distract U.S. agents. Migrants often arrive injured and dehydrated at those locations after walking long distances through rough terrain, the Loyal Source employees said. One employee who has EMT certification said he makes about $20 an hour, up from $16.75 when he started. He said he is often the only medical-care provider at stations in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona where 200 to 300 migrants sometimes arrive during a single shift. The agency also has employed certified nursing assistants with less training than EMTs, the employee said. “So many of them come from nursing homes having only worked in support roles, like changing bedsheets and things like that,” he said. Before child died in custody, CBP tried to replace medical contractor More than 2 million migrants were taken into Border Patrol custody during the 2023 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a historically high number for the second consecutive year. Record numbers of families with children have been crossing illegally, and the winter flu season creates added risk in crowded facilities where infections spread quickly. Loyal Source’sperformance came under greater scrutinyafter CBP began investigating the death of 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, who was held in U.S. custody for nine days after crossing the border illegally with her family in May. As Anadith, who was born in Panama, fell ill and her condition deteriorated, Loyal Source medical staff denied requests from her mother for urgent medical attention, according to CBP investigators and a court-appointed pediatrician who oversees care for migrant children in U.S. custody. The staff also mishandled records showing the girl had a heart condition and sickle cell anemia. Despite those findings and rare public criticism of the company’s performancefrom CBP, Loyal Source was added last month to the shortlist of companies vying for the new contract. A CBP advisory board did not recommend Loyal Source for the next round of consideration, but the agency’s procurement office overruled the board’s findings, according to the three CBP officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are prohibited from discussing the selection process. The contract selection was structured in a way that a company’s past performance could not be considered as a factor during the first phase, but it will become a part of the process in the second phase, the officials said. In a statement, CBP declined to respond to questions about the contract selection, citing “procurement sensitive information.” “CBP is intensely focused on ensuring that the procurement process is conducted correctly and with the utmost integrity and professionalism,” the statement said. CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, the agency’s internal affairs division, continues to review Loyal Source’s business practices and performance record, after assigning what is known as a “tiger team” of auditors, according to the three officials with knowledge of the probe. The investigators have recommended the suspension of Loyal Source’s current contract, two of the officials said. Brian Moore, the CEO of Loyal Source, declined requests for comment on the CBP investigation, the Aug. 10 cure notice and his company’s track record, referring inquiries to CBP. “Loyal Source is prohibited from responding to media inquiries regarding our CBP contract,” Moore wrote in an email. The $1.5 billion medical contract, which officials say will be among CBP’s largest ever, has become an albatross for the agency after more than a year ofadministrative delays and disputes. CBP officials said they are especially anxious about discussing the contract publicly because the selection process has already triggered so many procedural challenges. In September 2022, CBP tried to award the contract to another firm, Texas-based Vighter, but Loyal Source and other competitors filed protests to the Government Accountability Office alleging unfair treatment and procedural flaws. CBP amended its contract requirements after the protests, but Loyal Source filed additional challenges to the GAO, the federal entity that arbitrates contract disputes. The GAO denied Loyal Source’s protests in March, saying CBP had “acted reasonably and within its discretion.” GAO recordsshow Loyal Source and at least oneother companyfiled new protests Nov. 3. The notices do not indicate the basis for the challenges. In the meantime, CBP continues to rely on Loyal Source for medical services as part of a sole-source contract extension due to expire at the end of December. In Border Patrol stations staffed with EMTs or health aides, higher-paid doctors and nurses are available for phone consultations. Those providers, however, are often located in other states and don’t always respond to calls, the two current Loyal Source employees said. In recent months, Loyal Source managers have expressed alarm at high numbers of employees calling out sick and failing to report for shifts, warning that they will face termination, according to internal emails obtained by The Post. Group messages among Loyal Source employees show pleas for help from staff who say they are the sole medical provider on duty and need backup. A Loyal Source employee working in California said the company’s staffing shortages would improve if the company offered bonuses and better pay. “The solution to filling shifts at these stations in the middle of nowhere is not that hard,” the employee said. “Just pay $2 more per hour and I promise you the stations would be staffed.” Anadith Reyes Álvarez, whose parents are from Honduras, was diagnosed with influenza after five days in U.S. custody. She and her family were transferred to a Border Patrol station in Harlingen, Tex., that was designated as a medical isolation ward run by Loyal Source. Mabel Álvarez Benedicks, the girl’s mother, told reporters that Loyal Source medical staff refused more advanced care as her daughter grew sicker and begged for her life. “Only after [Anadith] lost consciousness and suffered an apparent cardiac arrest was an ambulance called,” wrote Paul Wise, the Stanford pediatrician appointed as an independent monitor for migrant juvenile care, in a report to the federal court system in July. Wise called the child’s death “clearly preventable” in his report. CBP investigators described “failures” by the Loyal Source staff and said the closed-circuit video system in the border station was not working at the time of the incident. CBP responded to Anadith’s death by banning several Loyal Source staff members from its border facilities. In June, the Department of Homeland Security reassigned CBP’s top medical officer and replaced him with Alexander Eastman, a senior DHS medical official. A DHS medical team that investigated the child’s death told CBP in June that the health-care system run by Loyal Source was unsafe and needed systemic changes. CBP officials said they have undertaken steps to ensure medically fragile people receive quality care. The agency “will continue to review procedures, practices, and equipment,” including prioritizing families for faster processing to minimize the amount of time children spend in U.S. custody, according to the statement. The GAO has 100 days to rule on the latest protests. Unless the GAO agrees to fast-track its rulings, CBP will have to wait until next year to announce the new contract, one official said, and Loyal Source will remain on the job.","November 19, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
274,Washington Post,India’s Mideast rethink: From a Palestine stamp to a ‘Modi-Bibi bromance’,Karishma Mehrotra and Karishma Mehrotra,"NEW DELHI — With war raging in Gaza, India’s embrace of Israel’s security concerns has underscored how dramatically the relationship between the two countries has developed since its chilly beginning. For most of independent India’s history, New Delhi had no diplomatic relations with Israel. Just over 40 years ago, India even issued a postage stamp depicting the Indian and Palestinian flags flying side by side and the words “Solidarity with the Palestinian people.” Today, Indian and Israeli flags are displayed together at rallies demonstrating solidarity with Israel after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. The two countries have developed significant military ties. And their leaders, Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu, share similar worldviews, including about the dominant role that their respective religions — Hinduism and Judaism — should play in their countries. Indian and Israeli media, using Netanyahu’s nickname, have dubbed their relationship the “Modi-Bibi bromance.” Along with many Western leaders, Modi immediately condemned the Hamas attack and later reiterated that the “people of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour.” This declaration reflects a wholesale change in New Delhi’s approach to the Middle East. India no longer keeps its friendship with Israel out of view and instead trumpets Israeli-style aspirations for muscular foreign and security policies. The “public acknowledgment” shows India’s growing “fascination with the Israeli model,” said Nicolas Blarel, a Leiden University professor who studies India’s relations in the Middle East. A year before Israel was established in 1948, Britain split its colony in the Indian subcontinent, creating India and Pakistan. At the time, Mohandas K. Gandhi and India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, were distraught over the decision to carve Pakistan out of British India as a separate Muslim country. They insisted that India be a secular country and balked at the Zionist movement’s campaign for the creation in the Middle East of another country based on a religion, Judaism. India became, in the 1980s, the first non-Arab country to recognize Palestine as a state, responding in part to the concerns of India’s large Muslim population, according to former diplomats. When Israel finally secured long-elusive recognition by India in 1992, this was viewed as a “prize” that would usher in wider recognition in the Global South. India was the last major non-Arab, non-Islamic country to initiate diplomatic ties. “The dispute used to be linked with ideas of decolonization, anti-imperialist,” said Navtej Sarna, who served as India’s ambassador to the United States and Israel. “But as India started looking more toward the West at the end of the Cold War, it started looking at Israel in a different way. … But we developed that relationship quietly.” As India engaged in border conflicts with Pakistan and China, New Delhi became increasingly grateful for an Israeli supply of reliable weapons, as did its “technology fetishism,” said Blarel. “Clearly, there is an interest in what Mossad and other intelligence services from Israel have been able to do to protect their territory.” Israel, meanwhile, found India to be a valuable customer for military and surveillance equipment. The United States had been concerned about Israel’s military relationship with China and pressured Israel to divert its military trade toward other countries, Blarel said. “The U.S. is very happy that India could step in,” he said. The military relationship ballooned, making India the top customer of weapons from Israel and a key co-producer. “The fact is that India had struggled with how to approach the establishment of the state of Israel at its inception,” said Arun K. Singh, a former Indian ambassador to Israel and the United States. “But the partnership has built up. Through successive governments, the relationship has sustained that trajectory.” After Modi became prime minister in 2014, he made public what had been discreet, said several former diplomats. “Till Modi, the political establishment was a little more cautious. Now, it is more upfront in acknowledging the nature of the relationship,” said a former diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely on political affairs. Much of the change, the diplomat said, came about because the “leadership feels less pressure to the sentiments in the left sections of the polity and the Muslim community.” In 2016, after Indian commandos carried out a raid inside Pakistan-controlled Kashmir in response to an attack by militants on an Indian army post, Modi trumpeted the action, saying: “Earlier, we used to hear of Israel having done something like this. But the country has seen that the Indian army is no less than anyone else.” Modi became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, in 2017 — he had previously traveled there when he was chief minister of Gujarat state — and made a stop at the grave of Theodor Herzl, Zionism’s founding father. He also walked along the beach with Netanyahu as cameras snapped photos. Since then, the economic relationship has continued to progress. At the Group of 20 summit  in New Delhi in September, the leaders signed on to a new “economic corridor” linking India and Israel with railway, pipeline and data components. Meanwhile, a consortium led by a company run by Gautam Adani, one of India’s wealthiest business tycoons with close connections to Modi, purchased Israel’s Haifa port. While India continues to support aid for Palestinian refugees, its United Nations vote in support of Palestinians is “no longer guaranteed,” said Blarel. He added, “India is now looking like an outlier in the Global South when it wants to be a spokesperson in calling out the double standards of the West.” It is ironic, said Blarel, that early Hindu-nationalist thinkers in India drew upon Nazi ideology, while contemporary supporters of Hindu nationalism extol the Zionist blueprint, which calls for a state that is both religious and democratic. “It’s difficult to square,” he said.","November 18, 2023 at 2:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
275,Washington Post,Russia pardons its most gruesome prisoners to join the military,Mary Ilyushina and Mary Ilyushina,"Vladislav Kanyus, a young man from Kemerovo in southwestern Siberia, brutally killed his ex-girlfriend Vera Pekhteleva, torturing, suffocating and stabbing her for hours. He was sentenced in July 2022 to 17 years after a high-profile trial that reignited a national conversation in Russia about the lack of protections against domestic violence and law enforcement indifference to such cases. But then Pekhteleva’s bereaved mother, Oksana, received a photo of Kanyus — not in prison but in a military uniform surrounded by other Russian soldiers. Her daughter’s murderer was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin in exchange for taking up arms in Ukraine. “I thought I was going crazy, I keep zooming into this photo and staring into his face in disbelief,” Oksana Pekhteleva said, described the shock it brought to her family. “You know what the human psyche is like, the first stage is denial.” To avoid calling another controversial mobilization and risk angering the public ahead of presidential elections next year, Russia’s military has relied increasingly on prison recruitment to bolster its ranks, a tactic pioneered by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the late Wagner Group mercenary boss. According to rights activists, the Russian Defense Ministry has enlisted as many as 100,000 people this year by scouring prison colonies and offering to chop off years from the sentences of people convicted of some of the country’s most gruesome crimes. Just days after the Kanyus pardon made headlines came news that a former police officer convicted for his role in the 2006 murder of Anna Politkovskaya, a prominent journalist, was also pardoned by Putin after serving six months of military duty in Ukraine. Jailed for 7 years, pacifist artist to Russian court: ‘I’m freer than you’ The ex-police officer, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 as one of five men charged with organizing Politkovskaya’s murder. (Who ordered the killing was never determined.) Politkovskaya’s work, uncovering Russian abuses during the Chechen wars, had resulted in numerous threats and attacks before she was shot to death in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building. Khadzhikurbanov’s lawyer told Russian media that his client recently signed another contract and will remain in the army. Kanyus was secretly pardoned in April. Vera Pekhteleva’s family was not informed but suspected that he was out of prison when they received the photo of him holding a weapon. By fall, Kanyus was posting photos of himself barbecuing on social media. About a week ago, Vera’s father got an official notice from the local prosecutor’s office informing them that Kanyus had indeed been pardoned and sent to the front line. The Kremlin has expressed no regret when questioned about Putin’s decision to free murderers to reinforce the Russian ranks in Ukraine. “Convicts, including those convicted of serious crimes, atone for crimes with blood on the battlefield, in assault brigades, under bullets, under shells,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. Alena Popova, a human rights activist who represents Pekhteleva’s family and has long lobbied for the introduction of a domestic abuse law in Russia’s criminal code, said she is concerned that freed convicts will bring a wave of violence back home, emboldened by their early release. Popova and her team said they are being flooded by calls and messages from people who have already come in contact with, or fear seeing, their abusers or the killers of their loved ones. Most cases most don’t generate headlines, she said, because people are afraid to speak out. Affected families fear repercussions because their abusers are fighting in what Putin has described as a “war for Russia’s future.” Any criticism of those taking part in hostilities could be viewed by the authorities as criticism of the war or of the military — which is now illegal in wartime Russia. Cops in the trenches: Ukrainian police key to fight against Russia Some of the most prominent rights activists in Russia, such as Popova and organizations such as Nasiliu.net (No To Violence), have been labeled foreign agents, a designation that puts anyone in contact with them at risk and further scares off women who might seek help. “All this is preventing us from shedding light on how massive this problem really is,” Popova said. “These people are coming back from the war with post-traumatic stress disorders — their hands had blood on them before and then they went to Ukraine and killed more people there — and they see that the entire system is backing them so they feel an absolute sense of impunity.” “Just before you reached out to me, I had a message from a young woman whose friend saw a rapist who long stalked her on the street, and took a handful of pills,” she added. “And this is just one case.” Families of victims have virtually no recourse to overturn the pardons, said Ilya Politkovsky, Anna Politkovskaya’s son. In astatementpublished by Novaya Gazeta, the newspaper where their mother worked, Politkovsky and his sister, Vera Politkovskaya, said they viewed Khadzhikurbanov’s pardon as “an outrage against the memory of a person killed for her convictions and professional duty.” “If I am being honest, we suspected this may happen,” Politkovsky told The Washington Post. “When this whole prison recruitment just started, I had a feeling that Khadzhikurbanov would really want to go to war.” “I think it’s unfair and illegal,” he said. “But, unfortunately, we are powerless and cannot change anything in this regard.” Pekhteleva’s family has filed a request to launch an investigation into the actions of their local prosecutor’s office, which recommended Kanyus for pardon and did not inform the family about his whereabouts. The family had petitioned to be notified of all of Kanyus’s movements during trial, a measure permitted by Russian law for the safety of crime victims. “We have been so humiliated by all this and no one wants to bear the responsibility,” Oksana Pekhteleva said. “There is such a flagrant violation of our law. … Why does our state treat us in such an outrageous way?” The fast track to freedom via the trenches in Ukraine, made possible by the Russian judicial and penitentiary systems, stands in stark contrast to the severe punishments being meted out against antiwar activists for minor infractions. Putin, eyeing reelection, signs law to allow voting in occupied Ukraine On Thursday, for example, Alexandra Skochilenko, a pacifist artist from St. Petersburg, wassentencedto seven years for replacing a few supermarket price tags with antiwar messages. Alexei Gorinov, a member of a Moscow municipal council who was the first person sentenced under a law penalizing the spread of “false information” about the Russian military after the invasion of Ukraine, recently had another case brought against him even though he is already incarcerated. In a statement, Gorinov’s supporters said that he was being accused of justifying terrorism, because he had made positive statements about an explosion that damaged the Crimean Bridge — Putin’s prized infrastructure project connecting Russia to Crimea, the illegally annexed peninsula. Kanyus, who never admitted his guilt in court, spent less than half a year in prison for the brutal murder. Five police officers received suspended sentences for negligence after neighbors said they tried for three hours to get help as they heard Vera Pekhteleva’s cries, but there was no response. By the time a neighbor broke the door open with a crowbar, she was already dead. “I feel like he will still get what’s coming to him, as there is also the judgment and punishment of our Lord,” Oksana Pekhteleva said. “I am not afraid of him but I am afraid that one day he may seduce some other girl, and if he was once capable of doing what he did and got away with it, he may torture her just like he did to my child.” The latest:The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipatedcounteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.

The vote to go ahead with the pilot program followed hours of emotionally charged debate about the church’s pastoral responsibilities toward gay people. The synod’s vote on Wednesday follows the House of Bishops’ agreement last month to commend “Prayers of Love and Faith,” a collection of prayers and readings for same-sex couples, for use in existing church services. The bishops also approved the prayers as the basis for stand-alone services. Two days of debate began with synod members — bishops, clergy and lay representatives — considering a motion put forward by the bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, the third-most senior bishop in the Church of England, in which she highlighted the uncertainty and tensions in the church over the issue and especially over the content of prayers for same-sex blessings. Thirteen amendments were offered to her motion, from those who wanted to recognize further the distress the issue had caused to gay people to those who wanted to abandon the work on same-sex blessings altogether. On Wednesday, the synod voted to accept an amendment from Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, to test stand-alone services, a significant move that some synod members pointed out might affect the “optics” surrounding the blessings, suggesting that they are weddings in all but name. The Croft amendment passed the House of Laity by just one vote. Support for the prayers for same-sex blessings came from the Church of England’s leaders, the archbishops of Canterbury and York, at the start of the special session of the General Synod. But tensions remain so strong that the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, told the synod on Tuesday that the disagreements “appeared to be stretching us to breaking point.” But he also said that “there should be no place for homophobia in our church.” Those who opposed the experiment with the prayers for same-sex blessings pointed out that once they had been tried, they would be hard to retract. “Trial services could never be withdrawn,” said the bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner. That would be too divisive, he said, while saying the idea of accommodating same-sex couples needed more study. “Like all doctrine, the doctrine of marriage is practical, but it is more than that,” he said. “It shows that what we do now is linked to eternal reality. How we use our bodies matters — they are temples of the Holy Spirit. This is more than devotion. The rationale for using these prayers needs far more elucidation.” The vote is not binding across the rest of the Anglican Communion, but it will be noted with interest, especially among those who have been highly critical of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby for being too tolerant of gay believers. Meanwhile, it was received with relief by Church of England members who back reform, many of whom feared that other amendments to Mullally’s motion would delay or even halt progress on the decision made by a synod in February to press ahead with prayers of blessing. Continuing conflict between conservative and liberal groups had already kept that decision from being implemented. Mullally, acknowledging that “we are in a period of uncertainty, and that many in the church on all sides feel pain at this time,” said the current synod should encourage the House of Bishops to continue its implementation. Getting the prayers to be permanently authorized will be a harder task, as that will require a two-thirds majority in synod. They received 52 percent of the vote Wednesday. Mullally and the bishop of Winchester, Philip Mounstephen, who have been co-chairing the Living in Love and Faith steering group, said in a statement: “The truth is — and as we have seen again today — that the Church of England is not of one mind on questions of sexuality and marriage. “Yet we must also reflect on all that we have heard from Synod — from across the whole spectrum — and redouble our efforts to find a space where we can live with our current disagreements because we believe that is what God is calling us to do.” Several speakers during the lengthy debates described their own experiences of being gay in the Church of England. “I realized what it means to be queer, the way you love beyond gender, the shame I’d absorbed about me, but Jesus showed me how to be ourselves,” said the Rev. Chantal Noppen, from the Diocese of Durham, telling the gathering: “We need to make progress.” Paul Ronson, who said he had been a church organist for 45 years, said: “We’ve all had enough. This has gone on long enough. Nothing can separate me from the love of God, I say to those who say I am going to hell.” The prayers to be tested for same-sex couples are below: A Prayer of Dedication God of grace, whose beauty, ever ancient, ever new, sings through all creation: enfold your servants N and N with your encouragement, hope, and love. Fill them with the grace to rejoice always in their love for one another, and to follow the Way of holiness and hope revealed in your Son Jesus Christ. All Amen. A Prayer of Thanksgiving Gracious God, from love we are made and to love we shall return. May our love for one another kindle flames of joy and hope. May the light and warmth of your grace inspire us to follow the Way of Jesus Christ, and serve you in your Kingdom, now and for ever. All Amen. —Religion News Service","November 17, 2023 at 11:43 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
277,Washington Post,Tolkien’s biggest fan? Italy’s Giorgia Meloni opens new exhibit.,Anthony Faiola and Stefano Pitrelli and Anthony Faiola and Stefano Pitrelli,"ROME — In a major speech to bolster support for Ukraine among political conservatives, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni quoted an unlikely source: Faramir, son of Denethor, who battled the orc hordes at Osgiliath. “I do not love the bright sword for its sharp edge, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for its glory,” Meloni, referencing J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, told an April conference in London. “I only love that which I defend.” Italy’s first female prime minister — and its most far right since World War II — has channeled Daenerys Targaryen from “Game of Thrones,” posing atop a smoke-spewing dragon at a 2018 comic convention in Rome. During last year’s election campaign, she briefly posted an image of herself next to an Iron Throne alongside the caption: “A mass invasion of foreigners? Not today.” Her far-right brethren from the Brothers of Italy party retreat each year to Atreyu, a summerfest named after the dragon-riding warrior in “The Never Ending Story.” Who gets to curate ‘David’? In Italy, the culture wars get a nationalist edge. Yet for Meloni and a horde of fantasy-loving politicians in Italy’s far right, nothing is more precious than the works of Tolkien, in whose writing they see themselves as a ragtag fellowship battling the Lidless Eye of the European left. Italy’s post-fascist far-right hosted “Hobbit Camps” for young conservatives as far back as the 1970s. In her autobiography, Meloni concedes to a lifelong adoration of Tolkien’s works, including dressing as the hobbit Samwise Gamgee with other politically aspirant youth. Now, Meloni’s government has transformed her greatest literary passion into a massive new Tolkien exhibition at Rome’s National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art. Commemorating 50 years after the British author’s death and costing a reported 250,000 euros ($271,210), the show was inaugurated Wednesday by Meloni and puts illustrations of orcs, elves and dragons in rooms adjacent to works by Marcel Duchamp and Jackson Pollock. Tolkien rejected attempts to interpret his books as real-world allegories. But nationalists in Italy and beyond see his black-and-white tale of “good” in the west and “evil” in the east as laden with Christian themes and traditional values. Thus, the exhibit has opened a new front in Italy’s culture wars, with liberal critics decrying the right’s appropriation of a beloved fantasy author and arguing that his sub-themes of environmentalism and personal distaste for totalitarianism make him anything but a far-right icon. But Italian progressives, known more for exalting the erudite works of Umberto Eco and Italo Calvino, are also looking down at what they see as the anti-intellectualism of a right-wing prime minister entranced by what some of them dismiss as high school literature. “The problem is not Tolkien or the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, but the fact that this is being put through a political lens and used as a tool for revenge by right-wing culture,” said Matteo Orfini, a national lawmaker from the opposition Democratic Party. He added, “I mean, I loved the book, too … when I was 15.” Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, rising far-right star, to get White House welcome This week, a satirical show, “Blob,” blasted out an AI-generated imageof Meloni as an elf. Il Manifesto, a left-wing outlet,declared the exhibitionan example of right-wing “hegemony in the name of the hobbits.” Rome’s La Repubblica called the exhibit’s opening evening “a regime’s parade,” referencing the sheer volume of right-wing ministers, allies, friends and party officials who attended the inauguration. Corriere della Sera, meanwhile,heralded her arrivalat the exhibit dressed in white, “like Galadriel, the tough elven lady from the Lord of the Rings.” Nicola Procaccini, a member of the European Parliament from Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, as well as a friend of the prime minister and fellow Tolkien fan, dismissed the left’s criticism as elitism. “It’s the typical snobbery of a left that deems simple stories not sophisticated enough to be appreciated,” he said. “That also goes for the New Testament. Parables are simple stories meant to convey high concepts. Now I don’t think Tolkien wanted to write a sort of New Testament … but his worldview was very spiritual, and that’s reflected in his works.” At the opening Wednesday, Meloni appeared to chide the press when asked about the show, first laughing, then saying “I don’t think you’re interested.” Inside, her culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, personally escorted conservative cabinet members through rooms holding an exact re-creation of Tolkien’s study and a hologram in which Gandalf, Frodo and company appeared to drift across a map of Middle Earth on green platforms. At a listening booth, eventgoers could hear dialogue spoken by Pino Insegno, voice of the character Aragorn in the Italian-dubbed version of Lord of the Rings. Insegno was the master of ceremonies at Meloni’s closing campaign rally last year, where he introduced her with the words: “Sons of Rohan, my brothers, people of Rome … the day of defeat may come, but it is not this day!” In various rooms, board games based on “Lo Hobbit” were encased in glass, along with a model of a thatched home in the mythical Shire and a framed sketch from an Italian Disney comic showing Frodo as Donald Duck. Elaborate duplicates of costumes from the Peter Jackson films held court alongside fantasy fest-like renderings of rearing dragons and roaring orcs. The exhibit also cites a variety of Tolkien fans — including former president Barack Obama,Pope Francisand Ringo Starr — and its only overtly political gesture appeared to be its mere existence. That, said Giuseppe Pezzini, a University of Oxford fellow and Tolkien expert hired by the curators to serve as the exhibition’s consultant, was by design. “My job was to make everything open and nonpolitical and scientific,” said Pezzini, adding that he identifies as left-wing. “That was my specific task.” A post shared by Stefano Pitrelli (@stefanopitrelli) Still, the event’s opening nevertheless appeared to be leveraged as something of a political moment. A gaggle of young men from the National Youth movement of Meloni’s far-right party — invited to the event by the Culture Ministry — roamed the exhibit, checking out the renderings of orcs and wizards and a Lord of the Rings pinball machine. “I am convinced that there are some extremely educational and formative aspects to the Lord of the Rings,” said Andrea Paramano, 21, of the youth contingent. “Loyalty toward friends, respect of traditions, and the theme of the journey — which is not necessarily physical, but also internal, formative.” After the first Italian translation of Lord of the Rings in the 1970s, the books were adopted as a new and wholesome frame for a post-fascist right in Italy seeking to redefine itself after the dark days of Benito Mussolini. Unlike conservatives in the United States and Britain, the Italian “new right” also held a deep distrust of the free market and consumer culture — something they saw rejected in a cautionary tale of One Ring to Rule Them All. At one Hobbit-themed camp in 1980 hosted by the Italian right wing, conservatives-in-training gorged on panini at a mock Prancing Pony (a tavern in the books) and grooved to the sounds of the band Compagnia dell’Anello, or Fellowship of the Ring. “We saw our own struggle in Tolkien’s work,” said Annalisa Terranova, 61, political editor of Secolo d’Italia, a right-wing Italian newspaper. “We were a new generation forming a sort of small fellowship, a bulwark against communism. We saw our battle for freedom against the shadow of Marxism and materialism.” ” Meloni embraced that tradition, using an early internet handle in which she described herself as the “little dragon of the Italian undernet.” In 2008, she appeared in a magazine alongside an image of the wizard Gandalf astride his steed, Shadowfax. In her autobiography, “I am Giorgia,” she writes of her politically active, conservative friends meeting each week to a “horn call” echoing “the mighty horn of Boromir from the Lord of the Rings.” Giorgia Meloni, grande appassionata di fantasy, ha visitato il #Romics ed è salita sopra un enorme drago esposto alla... Historians of Tolkien, however, dismiss his adoption by the far right as political appropriation. “I don’t see Tolkien’s characters in a fight against the left,” said Riccardo Capoferro, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome who has studied Tolkien. “That’s a very vague understanding of Tolkien as a writer and thinker.”","November 17, 2023 at 1:25 p.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
278,Washington Post,"Christopher Nolan talks streaming, actors and ‘Oppenheimer’",Olivia McCormack and Olivia McCormack,"According to director Christopher Nolan,there is a single characteristic that ties together all of the unique actors he has worked with on projects that include the psychological thriller “Inception” and his latest explosive biopic “Oppenheimer”: intelligence. “Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh. I mean, these are some of our greatest actors and they each find their own way to, as I say, shed their own skin and connect with the character they’re playing,” he said, namechecking just a few of the actors in his latest film’s extraordinarily vast cast. “They’re just very, very smart people who have a sense of the narrative.” During an hour-long interview with Post writer Jada Yuan — who wrote abehind-the-scenes bookon the “Oppenheimer” film and whosegrandmother Chien-Shiung Wuworked on the Manhattan Project — Nolan discussed how his actors took on the harrowing task of telling Oppenheimer’s story, the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike and whether his next project will be a John F. Kennedy biopic. Sharp. Witty. Thoughtful. Sign up for the Style Memo newsletter. “I think that the labor unrest we’ve just been through was a very necessary corrective in the streaming era because the studios had shifted the economics of how they distribute their material without adjusting the deals accordingly. And so it needed to happen,” he said, referring to the recent actors and writers strikes. “The key thing is to get principles in place. You can always build on what’s been achieved contractually at the next round of negotiations ... So I think these are excellent deals.” With the popularity of streaming-only content, there has also been growing concern about what will happen to works that find themselves hauled off the only places they can be viewed. “There is a danger, these days, that if things only exist in the streaming version they do get taken down, they come and go,” said Nolan, whomade newsearlier in the week for joking that he put such care into the physical release of “Oppenheimer” on Blu-ray to ensure that “no evil streaming service can come steal it from you.” In his conversation with Yuan, he explained, “It was a joke when I said it. But nothing’s a joke when it’s transcribed onto the internet,” before diving into the importance of owning media to preserve art.

279,Washington Post,‘The Crown’ gives the story of Diana’s death some surprising twists,Ashley Fetters Maloy and Ashley Fetters Maloy,"Imelda Staunton’s most stirring moment yet as Queen Elizabeth II comes late in a sixth-season episodeevocatively titled “Aftermath.” The music is haunting and somber in the wake of Princess Diana’s death in a Paris car crash. A television camera is seen adjusting its focus onto the queen as she prepares to make an address.With just a facial expression, Staunton expertly maps the royal matriarch’s stiff-upper-lip tendencies onto the personal and societal gravity of the situation at hand. It may undercut the moment for some viewers when Staunton then delivers a speech whose text has been available to read, word for word,on the royal family’s website for years. The care that “The Crown” takes in retelling 20th-century British history has long been one of its strengths. But in the first episodes of its final season, as its timeline finally rolls into a fateful stretch of 1997 that many viewers already remember with grim, intense clarity, the show seems more inconveniently beholden to history — perhaps even burdened by it — than ever before. The beats of the story told in these episodes are so TV famous, the images so recently and vividly seared into the collective memory, that the show’s window of artistic license seems to winnow ever narrower, leaving it little choice but to meticulously re-create them. So it’s in the private chambers just on the outskirts of the well-known story — settings where the public record had no business being or going at the time — where this four-episode arc of “The Crown” does its most interesting work. Season 6, which has six more episodes coming Dec. 14, opens in the summer of 1997 with several key players doing their best to move forward with dignity after the messy separation and divorce that marred the ’90s for the monarchy. Prince Charles (a dynamic Dominic West), now enjoying his hard-won happily ever after with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), plays nice with his sons’ mother, earnestly commending her charity work and devotion to motherhood. Elizabeth, meanwhile, reluctantly extends a hand of acceptance toward Camilla and thus modernity. Diana (Elizabeth Debicki), love-starved and feisty as ever, nevertheless puts on a brave face for the sake of Princes William and Harry (Rufus Kampa and Fflyn Edwards, respectively), who make an effort to be good sports even as paparazzi swarm them relentlessly and their parents’ new paramours invade their lives. The show’s costume and set designers dazzle with their ability to whip up imagery instantly recognizable from paparazzi photos and posthumous hagiography: the neon-green swim ensemble Diana famously wore on vacation with her sons and her new love interest, Dodi Fayed, in St. Tropez; the Repossi engagement ring Fayed purchased for Diana in Paris; Diana in a gray suit in the service elevator at the Ritz hotel; Diana in the black blazer, white pants and gold earrings she wore for dinner the night of the accident; the ambulances in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel; William and Harry walking in a loose, slow W formation alongside Charles, Prince Philip and Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, behind her casket during the funeral procession. Peter Morgan’s script handles the pressure to be authoritative only slightly less gracefully. Sure, a monologue from Diana about her charity work with land-mine survivors slows down the show’s deliberate march toward the inevitable. But a conversation between Fayed and Diana on vacation manages to include a succinct and relatively unobtrusive explanation of the lawsuit Fayed’s ex-fiancée has filed against him in the wake of their engagement’s dissolution. Sharp. Witty. Thoughtful. Sign up for the Style Memo newsletter. Given these faithful, careful representations, it’s surprising when “The Crown” imbues the most infamous event in its historical purview with a wholly invented circumstance. (Spoilers to come.) As they did in real life, Fayed (Khalid Abdalla) and Diana spend a few unexpected hours in their hotel suite at the Ritz in Paris after photographers and onlookers ruin their dinner plans. In the show’s version of events, Fayed uses that time to propose to Diana, an offer she gently turns down. An honest, affectionate conversation ensues, in which both parties acknowledge that the person who most wants them to marry is Fayed’s father. They decide together to make serious changes in their lives, for the better, as soon as they’re home from Paris the next day. It’s even stranger when, in the hours after her death, Diana visits Prince Charles and later the queen in their quiet, solitary hours as figments of their imaginations. She comforts Charles and nudges Elizabeth toward responding to the grief-stricken British public in the way Diana herself might. Fayed appears, similarly, to comfort and reckon with his father. Stranger still, it all works. “The Crown” takes a risk in imagining Diana and Fayed’s final interactions in that hotel room, and it pays off with a satisfying, devastating narrative about adults doing their best to finally grow up, to get a handle on their chaotic lives and their worst tendencies, just before everything spins tragically out of control. And the queen’s speech, comforting the nation after the loss of the People’s Princess? There’s simply no way to know whether the real Elizabeth felt guided or guilted by Diana into making such a gesture — and it’s jarring, yes, to see Debicki’s Diana pop back on-screen so casually after her dramatic demise. But the visit certainly raises the stakes — and makes for better television — moments later, when the show’s Elizabeth utters the same words the real queen did, acknowledging her less-than-beloved daughter-in-law’s wisdom and humanity before Britain and the world: “I admired and respected her.” The Crown(10 episodes) returns Thursday on Netflix with four episodes. The remaining six will stream Dec. 14.","November 16, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
280,Washington Post,‘Wish’ could’ve been great. Are new ideas too much to wish for?,Michael O'Sullivan and Michael O'Sullivan,"Sing along, kids, you know the words:When you wish upon a staaar… … Disney might sue for copyright infringement. Oops, is that not how it goes? Forgive my cynicism, but there’s something vaguely commercial, something faintly corporate, about the Mouse House’s new animated feature “Wish,” which, like nearly all Disney-branded content, opens with the musical strains of the instantly recognizable melody “When You Wish Upon a Star,” from “Pinocchio” — excuse me, from Disney’s “Pinocchio”; there areother versions— playing under the animated trademark of a castle. It’s not just the plot of the story, which in celebration of the studio’s 100th anniversary revolves entirely around the theme of wishes coming true. It’s in the songs (by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice), which include the lyrics, “When it comes to the universe, we’re all shareholders.” You’ll walk out of the theater humming that one, whether you like it or not. At times, the film feels less like an homage to a beloved legacy than a 1½-hour piece of advertainment. The tale begins in another castle, this one in the island kingdom of Rosas, a cosmopolitan Mediterranean melting pot whose Moorish architecture evokes the Iberian peninsula, populated by people of many skin tones, and with a culture that blends the influence of Islamic Africa with Spain and beyond. “Hola! Shalom! Salam!” shouts the film’s heroine, 17-year-old Asha (voice of Ariana De Bose), as she introduces us to her home. (The multiculti medieval production design, which includes a freckled, Afro-Latina protagonist — don’t say princess — with long braids, is the coolest thing about the film, said to take place in the 13th century.) Rosas is a special place, ruled by the sorcerer-king Magnifico (Chris Pine), who at first seems to be a benevolent despot. Magnifico has the power to grant wishes, which he does once a month in a special public ceremony. But he also has the power to withhold wishes, which he also does if he unilaterally deems a wish dangerous or unhealthy. Those wishes, depicted as glowing glass orbs — like floating Christmas ornaments — go into a kind of cold storage, never to be returned to their makers. Boo, hiss. When Asha, who has applied for the job of the sorcerer’s (cough, cough) apprentice, finds out, she takes it upon herself to retrieve her compatriots’ wishes, or at least the wish of her (cough, cough) 100-year-old grandfather (Victor Garber), a musician who dreams of nothing less than inspiring a new generation with his art. This mission is undertaken with the help of a magical anthropomorphic wishing star that falls from the heavens, beeping, whizzing and giggling, in the process giving Asha’s animal sidekick, an adorable baby goat in pajamas (Alan Tudyk), the gift of human speech. At one point, Valentino says, “I dream of a utopian metropolis where all mammals are equal and wear clothes!” It’s a meta-joke, and it’s kind of funny — half groan-worthy and half wink-wink witty. But it’s also pretty darn close to the dictionary definition of an animated Disney film. Which is also kind of what “Wish” feels like at times: not a movie made by filmmakers with an original vision, but one assembled by focus group, with an eye more on fan service than on fresh ideas. (It’s directed by Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn, from a script by Jennifer Lee, Allison Moore and Buck. Buck and Lee, of course, are the creative forces behind the juggernaut Frozen franchise.) “Wish” isn’t bad, but also it isn’t great. Or great enough for a centennial, at any rate. Is there a villainous villain? Spunky teen heroine? Cute talking animal (shades of Djali in “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”)? C-suite-approved corporate branding? Check, check, check and check. It all feels familiar, which is another word for comforting. And “Wish,” however recycled it may be, is at least that: warm, funny-ish and with its heart in the right place. It’s churlish to complain about something so silly. But Disney has a reputation to uphold: the “wonderful world” and all that. When blowing out the candles on this cake, however, it feels like someone ran out of breath shy of 100, making this one “Wish” that, sadly, doesn’t come true. PG.At area theaters.

281,Washington Post,In the galleries: A dazzling show of mammoth and minuscule prints,,"Among the creatures rendered on huge sheets of paper at Pyramid Atlantic Art Center are a large deer and a nearly life-size bear, but no big tuna. That’s because Big Tuna is not an image but a machine: It’s the nickname for the press on which the massive prints, some eight feet tall, were made. There are also smaller works in the exhibition, as indicated by its name, “Big and Little Inks.” Sharp. Witty. Thoughtful. Sign up for the Style Memo newsletter. Big Ink is a mobile print workshopthat has hauled Big Tuna coast to coast since 2012. The press produced the show’s largest pieces, all of which are vertically oriented black-and-white woodblocks. These include Gretchen Woodman’s exquisite picture of a deer, reaching toward a branch to grab one last apple as a rabbit supervises, and Ralph Robinson’s robust bear, defined by horizontal lines as if it’s a screenshot from a low-definition video. A few of the jumbo prints use their size to conjure an immersive sense of place. Matt De Leo places the viewer at sea, gazing across choppy waters at the refuge offered by a lighthouse. Even more detailed is Cait Giunta and Ned Roche's immaculate rendering of an old-fashioned office door from the inside, so the word “private” is displayed backward. It's a vivid evocation of interior space, and of a lost era. Supplementing the huge woodblocks are nearly 100 prints that scale from little to tiny. Of the smaller pieces most akin to the large prints, the standouts include Daniella Napolitano’s elegant “Baby Javelina” — a piglike wild ungulate — and Millie Whipplesmith Plank’s portrayal of three birds nestled in what appears to be barbed wire. Other little prints employ various techniques and often use color. One of the most vibrant is Ryan Kalentkowski’s watercolor-painted woodcut of a bird framed by what the title calls a “strawberry moon.” Such pictures may not require a Big Tuna to make, but their expressiveness is vast.

Texts and symbols characterize much of the work in “Sensorial Africana Superrealities: Five Contemporary Diaspora Artists,” a multimedia show at IA&A at Hillyer. All the contributors, three of whom were born in the United States, attended or now work at Howard University. The most prominent artwork is British-Nigerian Raimi Gbadamosi’s set of three hanging flags, striped in the red, green and black established as Pan-African colors by Marcus Garvey in 1920. Just as direct, if more cryptic, is Elka Stevens’s quilt, a traditional African American craft object given a modernist vibe with its array of stark black-and-white icons. Much busier are collage-drawings by Raul Moarquech Ferrera-Balanquet, who is also the show’s curator. The Cuban-born artist incorporates printed matter in which such words as “Cuba” and “libre” (“free”) are prominent. The phrase Black Lives Matter features in a piece by Reginald Pointer, but he works with ceramics rather than paper. His intriguing creations include two-part blocks in which faces interlock and a smoky-surfaced globe whose two round portals offer partial views of the interior. Akili Ron Anderson’s vigorous paintings are nearly abstract, but with shapes and details that evoke the human body. The swirling forms of one picture center on an eye, a universal symbol of awareness and perception that in this arrangement seems to focus on another symbol. The painting is hung so that the orb peers at those red-green-and-black banners across the room.

United by technique but distinguished by varied designs, the paintings in Dan Treado’s “Double Platinum” feature such motifs as concentric circles, overlapping dots and abstracted patterns suggestive of microscopic life. All the entries in the Addison/Ripley Fine Art show are painstakingly executed with multiple layers of thinned oil or acrylic paint to fashion surfaces that appear silky and almost machine tooled. Except, that is, two playfully lumpy sculptures made of wads of brightly colored bubble gum. Treado is not a representational painter, yet he’s skilled at illusionistic flourishes. His target-like pictures, made on round birch panels, have a sense of depth and motion that’s nearly hypnotic. (They’re from a series titled “You Are Getting Sleepy.”) Some of the other paintings feature blobby shapes whose graduated colors look to be shifting and reflective and that appear to be floating above the other imagery, even though the pictures are in fact perfectly flat. As the gum sculptures reveal, Treado isn’t solemn about his art. The show’s seven-foot-wide centerpiece, which contrasts three black-and-white panels with two that pulse with fluorescent forms, is called “Ex-Lion Tamer Moves in With His Mother.” That winking title is akin to Treado’s painting style, which employs meticulous processes to yield playful effects.

All the works in Donna Cameron’s show at Washington Printmakers Gallery are prints, but they incorporate vestiges of other art forms. Mostly derived from photographs, the collages in “Confluence of Energies” sometimes feature sprocket holes like those that edge 35, 16 and 8mm film. The artist, who divides her time between Brooklyn and Arlington, Va., holds a patent for cinematic paper emulsion, which recycles fibers into film stock. Some of the artworks, printed on paper, slate or aluminum, echo Cameron’sexperimental short films, a selection of which are available on You Tube. “World Trade Alphabet” shares the title, but not the imagery or format, of a nine-minute abstract film. Rather than horizontal, like a typical movie, Cameron’s prints tend to be strongly vertical. The blurred, overlapped details can be architectural, but several predominantly green prints depict ferns that reach toward the sun. The interspersed rows of standing sprocket holes suggest both organic stalks and man-made columns. Unlike in Cameron’s films, the images in these prints don’t move, but their repeated upright lines give them a sense of propulsion.

Greenbelt — the crunchy Maryland suburb admired in progressive circles as one of the nation’s longest-running co-op communities — is about to welcome back its creator, having beenselected as the new home of the FBI. The FBI? In a town with aco-op supermarketwhere directors meet each month to debate cashier wages, seasonal wine rotations and solar panels? Where locals catch bluegrass, open mic poetry and drag story hour at the New Deal Cafe? “Yes, we’ve got this sort of blue collar, union kind of cooperative legacy going back from the very beginning,” said Greenbelt Mayor Emmett Jordan, admitting that the earliest residents of his town may not have been G-man types. “But there’ll be new jobs for residents at all levels,” he said. “So it’s kind of hard to not be happy, not to welcome this proposal.” Greenbelt was meant to be President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s prototype for America’s utopian community, where families had green space and community resources for as little as $18 a month. There were apartments, rowhouses and some free-standing homes among the 885 units finished by 1937. When Roosevelt took office in 1933 amid the wreckage of the Great Depression, more than a million Americans were homeless, cities were cluttered with shantytowns and density swelled as unhoused families doubled and tripled up. The Resettlement Administration was created to address the crisis at the urging of agricultural economist Rexford G. Tugwell, who said the United States needed to urban-plan its way out of the housing problem. Tugwell “drove Roosevelt out here, actually, and said: ‘Look at this beautiful land. Let’s build a city here. Let’s build a small city and show the world how we can combine the best of both city and country living,’” said Megan Searing Young, director of the Greenbelt Museum. The government began ad campaigns with posters that asked: “Which Playground for Your Child? Greenbelt or Gutter?” The construction was part of the New Deal plan, hiring unemployed men to build the entire city from blueprints. The builders created a series of “super blocks,” with houses facing a collective green space. The sidewalks weren’t along the road but inside the space, Young said. The backs of the homes became the service areas, where milk was delivered and laundry was hung, but only during approved hours. And that was the rub for some. It was a collective with strict rules and standards. Though the homes were built by Black and White workers, only applications — 5,000 for the 885 units — from White married couples were accepted. The government’s housing managers carefully screened for income and compatibility, social engineering to ensure harmony in the new utopia whose manager reported, after its first year, had “not a shrewish housewife anywhere along the crescent.” “America’s most famous test-tube city, Greenbelt, Md. — often referred to by its neighbors as Utopia — is 1-year-old this month,” wrote Christine Sadler in an Oct. 9, 1938, article in The Washington Post. “It was last October that the first carefully selected families moved into the meticulously planned community 12 miles from the National Capital, with the Government as their landlord, friend and adviser,” Sadler wrote. The planners told Sadler that, psychologically, the town was thriving. “We think it is because everybody knows everybody else’s salary. All economic inhibitions are thus removed and there is no keeping up with the Joneses,” Otis Kline Fulmer, a managerial assistant at Greenbelt, told Sadler. “The results show up in an increased zest for life, community co-operation and happy faces,” Fulmer said. Just one family moved out in the first year (reportedly over a dog issue), and “only four Greenbelters were arrested in the year and all the arrests were for speeding,” he said. The nursery school, cafe, movie theater, grocery store and even the newspaper were run as cooperatives. Kids organized their own Gum Drop Cooperative, with 92 children buying in at 10 cents a share. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was beloved in the town andvisited often. Within the first year, Greenbelt had a pinochle club, bridge club, rifle club, camera club, bowling club, Scouts and American Legion, among other groups. The new residents happily called themselves “joiners.” But early on, some on Capitol Hill chafed at becoming landlords. “A national scandal” is what Sen. Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia called Greenbelt, which he nicknamed “Tugwelltown” in a July 5, 1937, Washington Post story. Greenbelt was costing taxpayers $16,182 a unitto build, while the average American home was constructed for just $4,000, Byrd said. Before the project even broke ground, an editorial in The Post called it “Tugwell’s Folly.” Soon Tugwell was being called “Rex the Red,” and Greenbelt was derided as a “communist boondoggle.” Only three of Tugwell’s green utopias were built; the others were in Greendale, Wis., and Greenhills, Ohio. “Of the three,” Young said, “we always like to say Greenbelt was the most fully realized plan.” Construction of other greenbelt cities stalled, and in the post-World War II United States, Levittown — the sprawling, car-centric model of American living — took over as the suburban template. This hit hard in 1949 and 1950, when the government divested from Greendale and Greenhills, selling off the land and homes. The same fate befell Greenbelt in 1953, “ringing down the curtain on one of the most publicized experiments of the early New Deal,” The Post’s Harrison P. Hagemeyer wrote. The town’snewspaper, continuously published as the Greenbelt Cooperator since 1937, changed its name to the Greenbelt News Review after the town was sold to the Greenbelt Veteran Housing Corp. Unlike in other greenbelt cities, the art-deco homes and the co-ops remain. And their legend lives on. “I’ve been working in co-ops for 30 years, and I was bragging when I landed a job here, in co-op land,” said Dan Gillotte, who recently became manager of the Greenbelt Co-op Supermarket.“There’s something really special about a place that still lives by the co-op ideals.” Jordan, the mayor, said that even as other housing developments, a shopping mall and now the FBI expand Greenbelt’s population, the original core of the 1937 New Deal utopia won’t change much. “It’s pretty much part of our DNA,” Jordan said, noting that Takoma Park — the Maryland suburb with the hippiest reputation — actually spun its co-op off Greenbelt’s. “That spirit of cooperation is alive and well in Greenbelt.”","November 18, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
283,Washington Post,Va.’s mental health system failed him. Could he fix it before the next tragedy?,Jenna Portnoy and Justin Jouvenal and Jenna Portnoy and Justin Jouvenal,"State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville) tugged on his earlobe, pointing to scar tissue doctors wanted to remove to mend the damage from an attack that left him physically wounded but gave his life new purpose. His son, Austin “Gus” Deeds, stabbed him with a knife while in the throes of a mental health crisis 10 years ago Sunday, shortly before the 24-year-old took his own life. A day earlier, a Virginia mental health worker had failed to find an emergency treatment bed for Gus. It was the worst moment of the Virginia lawmaker’s life, but he decided against surgery to remove the scarsthat snaked across his face. He didn’t want to smooth them over. He wanted the world to see them. “The scars to the extent that they remind people I’ve been through something, they will have an idea of the things that drive me,” Deeds said in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month in his Charlottesville office. “That’s okay, maybe it will get people to vote for the things I want them to vote for.” Deeds harnessed his national profile and a moral authority almost singular in American politics to try to transform Virginia’s mental health system into a model for the nation, after years of underfunding and neglect. Deeds has leaned on his charm, relationships in the legislature and has been unafraid to wield his own tragedy to bring attention to mental health in jail, to make it easier for youths to get treatment and to equalize disparities in care between poorer areas and the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs.  He’s the first to admit too many people still wait too long for inpatient emergency beds and community-based treatment in a system that is vastly inequitable and hobbled by a historic workforce shortage. Experts say lasting reform requires huge sums of money, time and political will, which are tough to come by in a purple state where governors have only four years to achieve their agenda. Deeds believes it’s possible. He has to. For Gus. A decade later, an answer has taken shape to the question at the heart of his mission: Has he — and Virginia — done enough to stave off the type of tragedy that tore his family apart? A new calling Siobhan Deeds said she had an intuition to call her husband on Nov. 19, 2013. When he picked up, he was running. He said just a few shocking words: Gus had stabbed him. “I love you,” Creigh Deeds said. Then he hung up. Moments earlier, Creigh Deeds was feeding the horses on his Bath County, Va., farm when Gus thrust a knife into his father’s back. Gus inflicted 13 wounds in all before Creigh Deeds escaped, bleeding and gravely wounded. A cousin on a hunting trip later found the lawmaker, who was flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center and rushed into surgery. Policediscovered Gus nearby, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Siobhan Deeds said she had seen a change in Gus in the months before the attack, ever since he stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder at William & Mary and moved home. The day before, Creigh Deeds obtained an emergency custody order for Gus, so he could get mental health treatment. But an evaluator couldn’t find a psychiatric bed before the six-hour hold lapsed and Gus was sent home with his father. Creigh Deeds woke up in the hospital days later with a tube down his throat and a question: “Gus?” After he was told his son had died, he lay in bed and resolved to fix a mental health system that had failed his family. “I was hurting. I was sad. I was mad,” Creigh Deeds said. “But I knew that I had an opportunity to do something.” Less than two months later, he was back in Richmond. Uneven results Deeds said he was still crying most days, but he set to work. He won passage for bills that patched holes the tragedy revealed. The most important extended the time evaluators had to find a bed for a person in crisis, created an online registry to find open psychiatric beds and required that state hospitals accept individuals in crisis when a private bed was not available. It became known as the “bed of last resort” law. But Deeds said he was told at the time by members of the House of Delegates that they would not support a broader package of mental health reforms. It was a nearsighted dynamic that he said has played out again and again in the state: “we address the crisis and we move on.” Still, Deeds managed to get approval for a panel of lawmakers to study mental health reforms. The Deeds Commission, as it became informally known and later the Behavioral Health Commission, would drive reforms in the state in the years that followed. The commission has helped get additional funding for housing those with mental illness, worked to make it easier to obtain counseling through Medicaid and pushed for changes to facilitate telemedicine, among a host of other changes. Deeds said one of the most important overhauls they have pursued was a program to greatly expand services and increase the quality of care at the40 community service boardsthat provide public mental health care across the state. It is dubbed STEP-VA. But mental health experts, politicians and the state’s own measures show the transformational change Deeds hoped for has remained elusive, despite real improvements that have bolstered the system. They said the state has chronically underfunded overhauls, failed to create enough community-based care that could address mental health issues before a crisis and improperly implemented fixes, which have sometimes created new problems. A nationwide shortage of workers and a surging need have also battered the system. Mental Health Americaranked Virginia 34th among statesin access to mental health care in 2023. Share this article Share State figures show admissions to Virginia’s psychiatric hospitalsspiked 68 percentbetween 2012 and 2021, driven in part by the bed of last resort law, private hospitals taking a smaller proportion of people court-ordered to treatmentand a mental health crisis created by the pandemic. The huge demand has strained Virginia’s hospital system, leaving many facilities at or over capacity in recent years and forcing those in crisis to sometimes wait hours — or even days — in emergency rooms for beds to open up. Anna Mendez, executive director of the Haven, a day shelter and homelessness services provider in Charlottesville, said the bed of last resort law “changed where the crisis point is in the system” without improving it. Instead of being sent home without care like Gus was, those in psychological crisis are being held in emergency rooms, minded by police officers. The solution, she says, is more robust community-based mental health services. “Mental health care has to be accessible in the community in order for it to really be mental health care and not emergency care, and the bed of last resort wasn’t designed to make that happen,” Mendez said. Deeds and other lawmakers say the state is still catching up from years of underfunding, despite allocatinghundreds of millions of new dollars in recent years. One analysis found the state needs to investa whopping $300 million more a yearjust to meet its goals for crisis care. A lack of money has delayed and hamstrung STEP-VA, leaving some services unimplemented and others anemic six years after its launch, according to a Behavioral Health Commission reportand other programs. Meanwhile, almost 70 percent of localities in the state have a shortage of behavioral health workers and61 percent of the state’s psychiatrists are nearing retirement age, a problem that was exacerbated by the pandemic, according to the Virginia Health Care Foundation. That shortfall was brought into sharp focus during the summer of 2021, when the state was forced to shutter five of eight state hospitals to new admissions for weeks because of a massive workforce shortage that caused unsafe conditions for patients and staff. Tragedies that echoed Deeds’s own have underscored what the state has left to do. A mentally ill manwasted away for weeksand died in a jail cell waiting for a psychiatric bed to open in 2015. In 2018, the police shooting ofan unarmed Richmond high school teacherin a psychiatric crisis stirred outrage. In March,a man diedafter sheriff’s deputies and staff piled on him at a state mental hospital. They have been charged with his killing. The deaths spurred calls for reform, but Lisa Dailey, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, said the incidents show ongoing issues exposed by Deeds’s tragedy have yet to be fully solved. “I’m still hearing a lot of anecdotal stories from family members who are desperately trying to make the system be responsive and are trying to get their loved ones into treatment,” Dailey said. “They are experiencing a lot of the same problems, which always makes me think of Creigh Deeds.” In December, Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R)declared Virginia’s mental health-care system in crisiswhile unveiling a new $230 million plan to address issues. ‘The need is huge’ Deeds said those tragedies weigh on him as well as the burden of being the face of mental health reform in the state. The national attention the tragedy brought him has made Deeds’s office a kind of crisis hotline. Soon after Gus’s death, a suicidal man phoned the office. He explained to Deeds’s legislative aide, Tracy Eppard, that if a hospital turned him away he was convinced he would take his own life and “would never see his family again.” Eppard made calls to get help. A police officer eventually found the man on the street and took him to a hospital. Later, Eppard received an email from a state agency that he was all right. “You helped save a life today,” it read. Eppard broke down crying. Deeds’s office was getting dozens of calls for help weekly. Ten years later, the number has dwindled, but they are still coming. “The need is huge,” Deeds said in his Charlottesville office on a recent day. “The need is not going away.” Deeds said he is proud of the work he has done over the last decade, but would not label his quest a success — and he might not be able to in his lifetime. By his estimation, Virginia has made progress on mental health reforms, “but we still have a lot to do.” He gives Virginia’s mental health system a middling C+. “We don’t do enough, well enough everywhere,” Deeds said. Deeds said he has no plans to mark the 10th anniversary of the tragedy — he lives it every day. After Gus’s death, Deeds said he pored over his son’s journal to understand his mental illness, but now he mostly thinks about Gus as a little boy. He pulled out his debit card, which features a portrait of his children from happier times in the late ’90s. Gus loved music, majored in the trombone and was on the dean’s list at William & Mary despite a serious mental illness. Time has not healed his wounds, but he said he is able to come to grips with the tragedy “a little better.” On a recent rainy day, Deeds hit play on a song that Gus composed as a student at William & Mary. The quirky bluegrass jaunt about the death of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt begins with a swell of angelic voices and a trombone. Deeds fell into a reverie at his desk and the wide grin of a proud father spread across his face. Despite working to reform Virginia’s mental health system for years, Deeds has never been to therapy for his own tragedy. He said his counseling has been throwing himself into overhauling Virginia’s mental health system. He said he thinks the state has done enough to make the type of tragedy that befell Gus “less likely,” but a host of new challenges and thorny problems have crept up since 2013 that have taxed the mental health system in fresh ways. On Monday, he brought the Behavioral Health Commission to order. It was the last meeting before the anniversary of the tragedy, but Deeds made no mention of it. He went directly into a presentation about mental health in schools. There was more to be done. “I think you have no choice but to try to be optimistic, even though the odds might be stacked against you sometimes,” Deeds said at his office. “You have to keep working.”","November 18, 2023 at 8:00 a.m. EST",18.0,11.0,2023.0
284,Washington Post,D.C. says teens need financial literacy. This is how it could look.,Lauren Lumpkin and Lauren Lumpkin,"D.C.'s top education official has unveiled a set of financial literacy standards, detailing what leaders think the city’s high-schoolers should learn about budgeting, saving and investing before they graduate. The recommendations, proposed by the state superintendent of education, are yet another revamp of what D.C.'s 98,000 schoolchildren are expected to learn. Within the last year, the state board of education has adoptednew social studies standardsand guidance formenstrual healtheducation. The financial literacy standards are designed for high schools and span lessons in five major topic areas. They are based on guidance developed by the Council for Economic Education and Jump$tart — which advocate for personal finance education — as well as input from teachers, students and financial literacy experts, according to officials. Many communities in D.C. have long asked that schools provide comprehensive financial education for their children. Christina Grant, the superintendent of education, said it “empowers” students to plan for their futures. “As our students embark on their post-high-school journeys, whether pursuing higher education or entering the workforce, a solid grounding in financial literacy is an important bedrock for navigating the complexities of making smart financial decisions,” she said. The Council for Economic Education estimates that23 statesrequire students to take a personal finance course to graduate. Studies have shownthat high school graduates who received instruction in personal finance had lower loan-default rates and higher credit scores than those from neighboring states without such classes. Officials will acceptpublic feedbackon the standards through Jan. 10, meaning they will probably undergo more changes before the school board determines whether to introduce them to classrooms for the 2024-2025 school year. But, for now, these are topic-level summaries of what students can expect. The complete set of suggested standards can be found on the Office of the State Superintendent of Education’swebsite. Students will explore different employment, benefits and compensation models. They will compare wages across careers and understand the factors that can affect how much money a person earns. Teens will learn about the purpose of taxation — and how and when to complete their taxes. Kids will be taught how to budget and make informed purchasing choices. They will also unpack the “historical, political, economic and geographic factors” that affect access to certain goods and services, such as medical care and housing. Students will unpack generational wealth and how its presence or absence can affect a person’s life. They will compare different types of savings accounts and discuss retirement planning. Students will also explore how inflation and deflation can shape their savings, and they will analyze the financial risks associated with services such as stock-trading apps and cryptocurrency accounts. In this section, teens will gain an understanding of the different ways to invest money. They will discuss the barriers to saving for retirement, how to manage investments and why companies issue stock. This section of the standards is dedicated to making sure students have a grasp of the risks and benefits of borrowing money. They will explore factors such as down payments and interest rates, understand credit scores and compare different methods of paying for college. Students will also be asked to consider the reasons and risks for services such as payday loans, check cashing services and instant tax refunds. Students will analyze different types of insurance, the factors that affect premiums — such as co-payments and deductibles — and compare plans. They can expect discussions about private versus government insurance and how people determine the kind of insurance they need.","November 19, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
285,Washington Post,Getting actually nervous before my virtual doctor’s appointment,John Kelly and John Kelly,"On the list of things I don’t like about myself is my dweeby adherence to rules. I’ve been that way since I was little. I’ve never run at a swimming pool, for example. It says it right there on the sign: “No running.” I’ve always been that guy who says, “Maybe we shouldn’t break into the cemetery and drink beer while leaning against the headstones.” Part of it — most of it, I guess — is that I don’t want to get caught. As a child I craved the approval of adults, which is a way of saying I feared their disapproval. While other kids were off egging houses I stayed behind, imagining my father putting his hand on my shoulder and saying, “Johnny, I thought you were better than that.” A lot of people prize rule-breaking and risk-taking. Rule-breakers and risk-takers are the people who move us ahead as a society. Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I’d egged the occasional house, stolen the occasional car, torched the occasional liquor store. I probably would have invented Apple or something. Even as an adult, I’m too eager to please figures of authority. Take doctors, for example. Or, more accurately for our purposes today, physician assistants. A couple of weeks ago I had a bad cold, my nose a phlegm volcano, my chest wracked with a barking cough. I get one of these every few years and often — not every time — some part of the viral infection refuses to leave. I develop a chronic cough that I suffer with for a few months before going to the doctor, who prescribes a course of steroids that miraculously cures it. The last few times, rather than wait three months, I’ve gone to the doctor sooner. I know what’s coming. I know what fixes it. Why should I suffer? Last week, after a few bad days, my body seemed on the mend. In fact, by the time you read this, I might be just fine. But I’m going away for Thanksgiving — out of the country, in fact — and so I thought I would prophylactically request some Prednisone and promise to take them only if I was still coughing a week later. I don’t mind the new medicine, where you communicate with your doctor through email. Saves a lot of time. But this time my doctor wasn’t so sure. Better, he said, for him to see me in person than simply dash off a prescription. And if I couldn’t come in for an office appointment in my waning days in the country, I could schedule a Zoom consultation. I don’t mind Zoom consultations, either. In the future, we’llneversee our doctors. We’ll have i Pads with dongles that can be inserted in various orifices to check our vitals. So I went online and booked a virtual appointment with a PA. And I broke the rules. You see, the appointment software said this PA was licensed to workonlyin the District and couldonlydo Zoom consultations with patients who werephysically locatedin Washington. I live in Maryland. How would they even know? After I booked the appointment I got an email from the PA. She was looking forward to helping me, she wrote, and she just wanted to reiterate that I had to be physically located in D.C. Again, I wondered: How would she know? Would my phone give me away? Had a tracking chip been inserted when I got the shingles vaccine? As the appointment drew closer, I started to get nervous. I’d repeatedly confirmed that I’d be in Washington for my virtual appointment. If they found out I wasn’t, would white-shirted goons kick down my door? Would the PA be arrested for practicing without a license? Would I never get my sweet, sweet steroids? And so, it embarrasses me to admit, I decided to get in my car and drive 1.8 miles from my Silver Spring home and across the DC/MD border. I thought: Wouldn’t it be ironic if I were injured in a car crash on the way to the “doctor”? I parked my car in front of somebody’s house on North Portal Drive NW and had the video call, my dog,Archie, looking on from the back seat. In the end, the physician assistant declined to prescribe the steroids. From my description of my symptoms, it sounded to her like my cold was waning. She said Flonase, Zyrtec and warm tea with honey should do the trick. She did prescribe an albuterol inhaler in case I got wheezy in a foreign land. I’ll be sure to follow the instructions on it.","November 19, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0

288,Washington Post,Biden picks Vanderbilt physician to lead National Cancer Institute,Dan Diamond and Dan Diamond,"President Bidenon Friday named W. Kimryn Rathmellto be the next director of the National Cancer Institute, where the prominent researcher will help oversee several White House-backed initiatives intended to reduce cancer deaths and accelerateclinical breakthroughs. Rathmell, an expert in kidney cancer, is the chair of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The Stanford University-trained physician and scientist has been a member of the National Cancer Institute’s board of scientific advisers since 2018, providing guidance to the institute’s leaders on its scientific research and operations. Rathmell’s new role as head of the cancer institute, which the White House said would begin in December, does not require Senate confirmation. As director of the National Cancer Institute, Rathmell will play a central role in carrying out Biden’s “cancer moonshot” initiative, the president’sstated goalto “end cancer as we know it” by better coordinating efforts across the federal government and the private sector, improving access to cancer screening and taking other steps intended to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent by 2047. Biden has also pledged that the moonshot will help improve the patient experience for those touched by the disease. “Dr. Rathmell is the talented and visionary leader the National Cancer Institute needs to drive us toward ending cancer as we know it,” Biden said in a statement Friday, adding that she “embodies the promise of the Biden Cancer Moonshot.” The National Cancer Institute “is critical to the success of the cancer moonshot,” said Danielle Carnival, who serves as the White House’s cancer moonshot coordinator. “We don’t have all the tools today to prevent, detect and treat cancer to reach those goals. And NCI is central in driving that progress and that innovation forward.” Rathmell did not respond to a request for comment. She succeeds Monica M. Bertagnolli, whom the Senate last weekconfirmedas director of the National Institutes of Health. In an interview, Bertagnolli said she believes that Rathmell is well-positioned to run the $7.3 billion cancer institute, the largest of the 27 institutes and centers that constitute NIH. As a board member, Rathmell helped develop and roll out the cancer institute’s April 2023national cancer plan, which detailed eight goals to prevent cancer and save lives, Bertagnolli said. “Now, she will be the one leading its execution as she steps into this job,” the NIH director added. Several experts noted that the National Cancer Institute has largely escaped the political battles that have ensnared NIH,the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand other public health agencies following thecoronaviruspandemic, as Republicans have alleged that federal health leaders failed to appropriately respond to the virus and have opened multiple investigations into the agencies’ operations. “We’ve not seen that [politicization] come across in the cancer world yet. It’s just too important,” said Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society. “We must ensurethat these breakthroughs actually get to people, and that will take a bipartisan strategy,” she added, calling on Rathmell to focus on improving access to quality cancer care, and to address “intractable cancers,” such as solving the rise in early onset colorectal cancer. “There’s still a lot of work to do,” said Lynn M. Schuchter, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, who listed challenges facing the cancer institute that include securing appropriate levels of funding, reaching more cancer patients and encouraging younger doctors to pursue becoming physician-scientists like Rathmell. Beverly S. Mitchell, a hematologist who previously led Stanford’s cancer institute and mentored Rathmell earlier in her career, touted Rathmell’s work to understand the molecular basis of kidney cancer and develop therapeutic approaches to treat it. The National Cancer Institute “stands for the very best in terms of both fundamental research, which we have to have if we’re going to push knowledge forward, and also applying it to clinical problems,” said Mitchell, adding that Rathmell’s experience working in research labs andat the patient bedside made her an “excellent match” for both parts of the role. Rathmell waselectedlast year to the National Academy of Medicine, a nonprofit organization established to provide the government with independent advice on medical policy from top experts, in recognition of her work on kidney cancer and professional mentorship of other physicians. “She is anamazingly accomplished physician and scientist,” said Carnival, the White House cancer moonshot coordinator, who praised Rathmell for “having one foot in clinical practice and one in genetics and molecular biology.”","November 17, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
289,Washington Post,Amazon removes 7 eye-drop products after FDA warning,Julian Mark and Julian Mark,"Amazon is removing seven eye-drop products from its e-commerce site after the Food and Drug Administration warned the company that the products were unapproved, the company announced Wednesday. In a Nov. 13 letterto Amazon chief executive Andrew Jassy, the FDA said that the unapproved products were “especially concerning from a public health perspective” because they are administered through the eyes and can bypass the body’s natural defenses. Amazon said in a statement that the products cited by the FDA “have been investigated and are in the process of being removed.” “Safety is a top priority at Amazon. We require all products offered in our store to comply with applicable laws and regulations,” the company said. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Interim Washington Post chief executive Patty Stonesifer sits on Amazon’s board.) The FDA listed these products: Is it still safe to use eyedrops? Answers about recent safety warnings. Less than a month ago, the FDA issued a warning that26 eye-drop productsrisked causing vision loss or blindness. CVS Health, Rite Aid and Target subsequently removed the products from their shelves and online stores. Previously this year, an outbreak of serious bacterial infections, resulting in at least 14 cases of permanent vision loss and four deaths, prompted two voluntary eye-care product recalls. Millions of Americans use eye drops for conditions such as glaucoma and allergies, and medical experts say most of the products are safe.

290,Washington Post,"The terrifying, true tale of ‘zombie ants,’ and what it teaches",Marlene Cimons and Marlene Cimons,"The lancet liver fluke has a cunning — some might say horrifying — way of ensuring its survival. It turns ants into zombies. That’s how researchers who study this tiny parasitic flatworm often describe the first stage of its complicated life cycle, one that exploits ants, grazing animals such as cows, deer and sheep, and snails to secure its next generation. “The lancet liver fluke is the poster child of parasite manipulation of host behavior,” said Brian Lund Fredensborg, a parasite ecologist and associate professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, who with former graduate student Simone Nordstrand Gasque, recently published astudyon the role of environmental factors in switching the ants’ zombielike behavior back to normal. The lancet liver fluke and other parasites are organisms that live on — or in — host organisms and depend on their hosts for sustenance. Although the study in the journal Behavioral Ecology is not directly applicable to humans, parasites generally exact a huge disease burden globally, and growing insights about parasitic behavior could increase scientists’ knowledge about their level of sophistication, especially when it comes to interacting with their hosts. “Knowing more about them could enhance our understanding of how other behavior-manipulating parasites work, maybe including some that infect humans,” Fredensborg said. The lancet liver flukerarely infects humans, and it does not affect the human brain, he added. Here’s how the lancet liver fluke’s story unfolds: An ant eats some flukes, and a lone self-sacrificing fluke — the worm dies in the process — migrates to the ant’s brain,infecting andessentially hijacking it. Hundreds of others invade the insect’s abdomen where they temporarily hide in a capsule they create that protects them from the ant’s stomach acid. The fluke in the brain heads to the ant’s suboesophageal ganglion, part of its central nervous system, and causes the infected insect to climb to the top of a blade of grass in the cool of dawn or dusk, clamp its jaws around the blade and stay there. (The researchers refer to the ant’s actions as “a reversible and radical behavioral change.”) When cattle, sheep or deer come to graze, they eat the ants along with the grass, and the worms settle into the larger animal’s liver. There, the wormslay eggs, which arelater excreted in the hostanimal’s feces. The feces, in turn, are eaten by snails, the fluke’s final destination. Larval flukes reproduce inside the snails, multiplying by the thousands. Eventually the snails cough them out in a ball of mucous, drawing ants. The bugs feast upon the fluke-infested slime, and the cycle starts all over again. “Changing the behavior of your host is a smart way for a parasite to increase the chance of reaching the next host in the life cycle,” Fredensborg says. “It is particularly common where a parasite needs one host to be eaten by the next. Parasites in nature influence who eats what and how much in a subtle way, but with important ramifications to how ecosystems function. The big question is how parasites manage to take control over host behavior.” Some scientists speculate that the process involves manipulating certain brain chemicals. Fredensborg cites one human example,toxoplasma gondii, a parasite found in undercooked meat and cat feces.Researchsuggests it may affect the function of dopamine and promote thedevelopment of schizophrenia. Dopamine, which is produced in the brain, is important for many body functions — movement, for example — and is implicated in several mental health and neurological diseases. Fredensborg stresses, however, that the workings of these parasites are quite different. “The behavior changes themselves are not similar between the host Toxoplasmaand ants infected with the lancet liver fluke, but the underlying mechanisms may be,” Fredensborg says. “Both lodge themselves in the brain, and in a location suited to manipulating a specific set of behaviors. In Toxoplasma,we know that dopamine is involved. In the lancet liver fluke we do not yet know what neuromodulators are involved, but dopamine is one of the main suspects because it induces novelty seeking and biting behavior.” Scientists have discovered what may be the first ‘vampire’ virus Wondering if they could tinker with the infected ants’ behavior, Fredensborg and Gasque combed the Bidstrup Forests near Roskilde, Denmark, tagging ants for study — not an easy task. “Simone became a true master at finding and tagging the infected ants in the forest, but it was definitely a challenge in the beginning to place a droplet of glue and the tag on the behind of ants without sticking the tag or the ant to your own finger,” Fredensborg says. The scientists discovered that air temperature mattered. At dawn and dusk, when it was cool and when most animals like to graze, the ants were more likely to remain attached to the top of the blade and be eaten. When it got hotter, they let go and crawled back down. “We joked about having found the ants’ ‘zombie switch,’” Fredensborg says. The lancet liver fluke isn’t the only worm that induces behavior attractive to predators, Fredensborg says.Microphallus papillorobustusmigrates to the brain of amphipods — small aquatic crustaceans — causing them to seek light and move upward to the water’s surface, where they swim erratically, cling to vegetation — and are then eaten by ducks. Euhaplorchis californiensislodges in the brains of killifish, prompting erratic behavior that draws herons.Fasciola hepaticais common in livestock, including in the United States, but rarely found in humans, although people can pick it up from tainted watercress or drinking water, Fredensborg says. “This research shows that natural selection has fine-tuned this takeover of the host to synchronize it with the activity patterns of the next host in the parasite’s life cycle,” says Robert Poulin, evolutionary ecologist and professor of zoology at the University of Otago in New Zealand, who was not involved in the study. “Cool temperature is the trigger for the parasite to assume control and get the ant to climb up a grass blade at the time when a grazing animal is most likely to be feeding, whereas warm temperatures cause the parasite to release its control of the ant and allow it to resume normal behavior and avoid overheating.” Poulin, who supervised Fredensborg’s doctoral research years ago, characterized the worm’s actions as “a conditional manipulation” driven by external temperatures. “I cannot think of another example like this one, although this may just be because we have not looked hard enough,” Poulin says. “Who said that parasites were simple and degenerate creatures? They are amazing.” The findings suggest that the environment can be engineered to return the ants back to normal. “Inducing a reversible radical change of behavior — flipping the switch — is probably unique to the lancet liver fluke,” Fredensborg says. “However, our hope is that this ability may help us characterize how parasites change host behavior by comparing the neurochemistry of ‘switched on’ with ‘switched off,’” and drawing a link between infection of the host, its brain changes and subsequent behavior.","November 19, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
291,Washington Post,"Don Walsh, Navy officer who reached ocean’s deepest spot, dies at 92",Brian Murphy and Brian Murphy,"The depth gauge counted off the descent through the inky ocean darkness: 29,000 feet, 30,000 feet, 31,000 feet. At nearly 32,400 feet into the Pacific’s Mariana Trench, a muffled bang jolted the bathyscaph Trieste. The two men on board froze in dread. The water pressure at this depth was nearing eight tons per square inch.Any breach in the structure would be the end. Another moment passed. Nothing more. What they didn’t know at the time was that one layer of acrylic glass in a viewing port had cracked because of a shifting metal fixture. The rest held. “We decided to proceed,” recalled Don Walsh, then a Navy lieutenant, who joined Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccardon the mission. Deeper still: 33,000 feet, 35,000 feet. Nearly five hours after leaving the surface on Jan. 23, 1960, the Trieste sensors detected the seabed: the deepest point in all the oceans, known as the Challenger Deep. The descent stopped at about 35,800 feet. The craft’s lights lit up the silty flats at more than 6.7 miles down. They were the first humans to set eyes on it. “It was really mare incognita,” said retired Navy Capt. Walsh, who died Nov. 12 at 92. Capt. Walsh and Piccard spent 20 minutes at the ocean floor, taking measurements and peering through the super-fortified viewing holes in the Trieste. What they saw opened new frontiers in deep-sea marine biology. They reported spotting a fish, shrimp and jellyfish at depths below 30,000 feet. The observations were the first eyewitness clues to the range of life that could survive in the most extreme depths. The voyage also was an audacious stress test for deep-sea exploration. No one was really sure how the Trieste — nearly 60 feet long — would hold up. Its steel hull was held together by a special epoxy, an innovation designed to better withstand the intense water pressure. The Navy kept the entire project, code-named Nekton, under a cloak of secrecy. One reason was the ingrained wariness of the Cold War, when fears of Soviet spying surrounded any new technology. The other motivation was that Navy officials didn’t want to report a failure to the public if the mission ended in disaster. While the Triestewas being outfitted at the Navy Electronics Laboratory in San Diego, Capt. Walsh was asked to brief a visiting admiral on the craft’s design and use of epoxy bond. “He fixed me with an admiral’s ‘evil eye’ and said, ‘Lieutenant Walsh, the Navy does not glue its ships together!’” Capt. Walshwrotein an April 2014 article in Scientific American. “Perhaps,” Capt. Walsh added, “but ours was glued.” Pollution reaches even the ocean's deepest spot Capt. Walsh first heard of the Trieste after the Navy purchased the craft in 1958. The Navy sought volunteers to train with Piccard, who designed the vessel with his father. Capt. Walsh stepped forward. “There was an opportunity to pioneer,” hesaidin a 2010 interview. “I wasn’t sure what I was going to be doing, but I knew I’d be at sea. It wasn’t until later they told us what they had in store.” His deepest dive in a submarine until that point was 300 feet. To make the craft ready, every reinforcement and modification had to be devised by Navy engineers and Piccard, who died in 2008. No one had attempted anything like this before. “Cameras, lights, samplers, sensors, instrument sensors — all of that we had to design and build, or have built,” Capt. Walshsaidin an interview with USNI News. “So we were writing the book for deep ocean operations.” Test dives were done in 1959, each progressively deeper. They learned along the way. Some outside instruments failed under the water pressure. The Trieste, however, held up nicely. On Jan. 15, 1960, in a final run, they dove to 23,000 feet in the Pacific near Guam. The Trieste was towed by the USS Lewis to a spot above the Challenger Deep, about 200 miles southwest of Guam. When Capt. Walsh and Piccard — the “hydronauts” — inspected the Trieste at sunrise on dive day, they were dismayed. Seawater has slashed into the vessel. Equipment was tossed about. “The tow from Guam,” wrote Piccard, “had taken a terrific toll.” Still, there were no malfunctions in the electrical systems and electromagnets, used to control ballast release. “I made the decision,” recalled Capt. Walsh. “We would dive.” The 350-pound hatch was bolted shut. The pair squeezed into a square chamber with 38-inch sides and a five-foot-eight cap. At 36,000 feet, Piccard dumped ballast to slow the descent to six inches per second. The craft was already a mile deeper than Mount Everest’s summit. As the bottom neared, Capt. Walsh counted down via underwater acoustic link to the tug USS Wandank, whose communications call sign was “Pittsburgh.” “Thirty … 20 … 10,” said Capt. Walsh, according to Navy records. The Trieste’s depth gauge registered more than 35,800 feet. (The device’s calibration was slightly off, and the depth was later determined to be 35,797 feet.) “Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, this is Trieste, we are on the bottom of the Challenger Deep at six-three hundred fathoms. Over,” Capt. Walsh said. “Trieste, Trieste, this is Pittsburgh,” came the reply from Lt. Larry Shumaker. “I hear you faint but clear.” As the Trieste left the bottom, Piccard and Capt. Walsh celebrated by waving Swiss and American flags and eating their own provisions: bars of chocolate. Donald Walsh was born on Nov. 2, 1931, in Berkeley, Calif. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his mother, who did a variety of jobs including working at the local telephone company. He enlisted in the Navy in 1948 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1954. He became a submarine officer, commanding the USS Bashaw. After the Challenger Deep mission, he was awarded the Legion of Merit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He retired from the Navy in 1975 with a master’s degree in political science from San Diego State University, where he studied while in military service. He then earned a doctorate in physical oceanography from Texas A&M University, and taught the subject at the University of Southern California from 1975 to1983. He consulted on several films, including“Raise the Titanic”(1980) and“The Hunt for Red October”(1990). In 2001, he visited the wreck of the Titanic on the commercial MIR-2 submersible. The vessel touched down on the deck of the Titanic while the crew had lunch. In 2010, he was awarded the National Geographic Society’s highest honor, the Hubbard Medal. Two years later, he was part of the support team for film director James Cameron’ssolo mission into Challenger Deep. (The Trieste’s Challenger Deep depth mark was surpassed in 2019 by missions led by explorer Victor Vescovo, reaching 35,843 feet.) Capt. Walsh died at his home in Myrtle Point, Ore., said his daughter Elizabeth. No cause was given. Besides his daughter, survivors include his wife of 61 years, Joan Walsh, and son Kelly, who reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep in June 2020 — more than 60 years after his father’s voyage — in a dive with Vescovo. There still remains a lot to be explored, Capt. Walsh often reminded audiences. He said that robotic vehicles may do the “heavy lifting” in many deep-sea missions. “But there will also be a need for putting humans down there to make direct observations,” hetold National Geographic. “We’ve only adequately studied 8 percent of the world oceans,” he said. “I’d suggest there’s a lot of work left to do, whether it’s the deepest part of the ocean or anywhere else.”","November 17, 2023 at 6:45 p.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
292,Washington Post,"Crushing at Florida State, heaving for Washington and the radio tells all",Chuck Culpepper and Chuck Culpepper,"On a lonely nighttime interstate with its usual plump trucks and dead deer, the magic radio told its Saturday stories to anyone afflicted with college football curiosity.An injury at No. 4 Florida Statecounted as lousy even by the standards of injury lousiness. No. 7 Texas tried to wrestle through a good Iowa State in Ames to show it can win every which way. No. 25 Kansas and No. 21 Kansas State staged their joint palpitation. No. 9 Missouri faced fourth and 17 while trailing Florida 31-30. And No. 5 Washington … As Washington began its fourth quarter at No. 11 Oregon State ahead by a sliver at 22-17, Huskies play-by-play man Tony Castricone lent the moment a beautiful framing: 15 minutes to a chance at 11-0, 15 minutes to reserve a berth in the Pac-12 championship game, 15 minutes to preserve ironclad national-title ambition. That’s all. How does anyone, let alone a bunch of anyones under 25, remember how to function in such heaviness? College football winners and losers: Once again, No. 5 Washington finds a way All of it quaked around the dial in the hyperventilation of November, when college football fates get cemented and when, routinely yet bizarrely, a 13-member committee sitting near the airport in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex assesses it all to make a rankings list due for national evaluation come Tuesday night. How will that committee factor in the nauseating injury to Florida State quarterback Jordan Travis? That leg injury in the first quarter against North Alabama, which had happened just before the car radio revved up, not only saddened Travis’s admiring teammates and the admiring crowd in Tallahassee but also sent Travis to the hospital as another jolt in his long, exemplary, six-season climb past the urge to quit and into this golden season. “I’d rather not even talk about that right now,” Florida State running back Lawrance Toafili told reporters. After the Seminoles slipped past North Alabama to reach 11-0 and as they head for Gainesville and their dear chum Florida next week with veteran backup Tate Rodemaker, the committee faces a decision redolent of 2014. That’s when Ohio State had lost starting quarterback Braxton Miller in the preseason and second-string quarterback J.T. Barrett in the Michigan game Nov. 29 and had to proceed with third-string Cardale Jones. The committee nodded at Ohio State anyway after its 59-0 win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game, Jones turned out to be a football comet, and the Buckeyes wentall the way to the confetti rain shower. Now, in parsing all the accomplishments and capabilities, the committee might use rationale to dock Florida State to the dreaded No. 5 — it’s a four-team playoff, arranged at last Dec. 3 — while boosting Washington to No. 4 (when it belongs actually at either No. 2 or No. 1). Florida State lost more than a quarterback with 207 completions in 324 attempts for 2,755 yards, 20 touchdowns and only two interceptions; it lost a core principle. It lost a grand concept. It lost one of the most objectively admirable players going, whereupon Travis, of course, cheered on teammates from the hospital. “You know, it’s hard to see any player go down,” Coach Mike Norvell told reporters, “but obviously Jordan’s so important to this team, not just as a quarterback but who he is, what he stands for.” He soon said: “It was emotional. It was emotional for everybody.” Jordan Travis’s gruesome leg injury deals a blow to Florida State At least the value of low expectations might help out for the Florida visit and an ACC championship game tangle Dec. 2 with No. 10 Louisville, which reached a look-here 10-1 after going to Miami, trailing 28-23 after three quarters and winning, 38-31, after which cornerback Quincy Riley told reporters in Miami Gardens, Fla., “Nobody expected us to be here,” a routine statement from an athlete that, for once, came across as unarguable. 🗣️ GOING TO THE ACC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME#Go Cardspic.twitter.com/X6Ca Ex8kn X Well, Missouri (9-2) converted that fourth and 17 from its 33-yard line when Brady Cookzinged one deep down the middleto a waiting Luther Burden III for 27 yards. Missouri won, 33-31, ona 30-yard field goal with five seconds left by Harrison Mevis, that throwback to those old glory days when kickers weren’t so damned svelte and when they apparently ate some of the things we all shouldn’t eat. And Texas (10-1)scrapped through, 26-16, in Ames, Iowa, to show us something fresh and considerable: its versatility. And Kansas State (8-3) let the goal posts stay upright at Kansaswith its tingling 31-27 win, keeping afloat a wish for a Big 12 title-game rematch with Texas, which it carted into overtime in Austin. And the magic radio told of Georgia Tech players going over to greet Georgia Tech students aftera 31-22 win over Syracusebrought meaningful bowl eligibility just before a visit from No. 1 Georgia, which looks like pure heaven and pure hell yet again. And in the daytime Coach Jerry Kill’s New Mexico State (9-3) had scoredan upset rompits players will never forget, 31-10 at Auburn. And No. 17 Arizona (8-3), among the wonders of the season, hadclobbered No. 22 Utah, 42-18, for a fifth straight impressive win. And Appalachian State, that curious collector of thrilling games, hadupended unbeaten James Madison, 26-23,in overtime at the gorgeous Harrisonburg, Va., campus that had spent the Saturday with that ESPN “College Game Day” stoking. And now Washington, one of the delights of the season, tried the fine art of hanging on — for one of the best road wins anybody has snared all year. The Huskies never scored after halftime as their 22-10 lead withered steadily. The terrific Beavers (8-3) built their drives as if beholden to their mascot, with painstaking, incremental construction. One of them, in the third quarter, took 16 plays, 78 yards and 9:56 of clock. “That one, you see just the wear and tear in the eyes [of the defenders],” said Kalen De Boer, the fantastic Washington coach, to reporters in Corvallis, Ore. “You know [that] in the fourth quarter, those are the things that can come back to haunt you.” The Huskies’ defense might have heaved. The Heisman Trophy campaign of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. might have suffered after his 13 for 28 for 162 yards in the rain. But this strange game isn’t about those things in the end, and so here came the Beavers again, and here dug in the Huskies, almost visible clear from Tennessee through a magic radio under a crescent moon. Here came the hidden plays that define a season. On first down from the Washington 15-yard line, that score still teetering at 22-17, Huskies defensive lineman Tuli Letuligasenoa stalled the Beavers’ outstanding running back, Damien Martinez, for a two-yard loss. The Huskies hurried Oregon State quarterback DJ Uiagalelei into two incompletions, with Bralen Trice notching the hurry on the third down. The Beavers had to settle for a 35-yard field goal from Atticus Sappington, one of the better kicker names ever. The score stood 22-20. The Washington offense short-circuited again. It had run only 13 plays all second half. Here came one more Oregon State possession, budging Beaver-like up the field from the 5-yard line to the 41. The season-long dreams quivered. The Huskies tried to hang on. Then they did, on a fourth down from the Oregon State 47, and then Penixthrewa clinching 19-yard, third-down, back-shoulder pass to brilliant wide receiver Rome Odunze, and the Seattle hopes kept soaring, and a Pac-12 title-game doozy with Oregon kept looming, and Castricone finally said, after finding so many words this season, “This team is indescribable!” Thank goodness for satellite radio.

293,Washington Post,No. 20 Maryland gets a boost from its bench to deny upset-minded Syracuse,Kareem Copeland and Kareem Copeland,"Bri Mc Daniel sprinted down the sideline as the horn sounded inside Xfinity Center on Sunday afternoon. Red braids swung behind her as she screamed and stomped toward her teammates after No. 20 Maryland held on for an 83-81 victory over Syracuse. Coach Brenda Frese had emphasized the need for bench help after her Terrapins suffered ugly road losses to top-10 foes South Carolinaand Connecticutby a combined 70 points over the past week. On Sunday, she got it — from Mc Daniel and Allie Kubek. “Just coming in ready to disrupt,” Mc Daniel said of the final play. “Be the person that my team [can] depend on. I wanted to make a play and made it.” In a game that had 21 lead changes and required Maryland to respond after an 11-point second quarter, the Terps found themselves with a two-point lead with 10 seconds left and needing one last stop. Syracuse guard Alaina Rice dribbled right, looking for a teammate. She reversed course and went back left as Maryland defenders swarmed. The play got frantic as the seconds ticked off and the long arms of Terps guard Lavender Briggs blocked any passing lanes. Rice picked up the ball, and that spelled doom for the Orange: Mc Daniel slid over, stole it away and began to sprint up the court. Denied a program-defining moment, the Terps can’t chase down Michigan It wasn’t pretty, but the Terps finally found some help for starters Shyanne Sellers, Jakia Brown-Turner and Brinae Alexander. As Maryland (2-2) struggled early, Kubek was a shining light. The Elkton, Md., native, a redshirt junior, transferred from Towson before last season but was lost for the year after she tore her left ACL in a September practice. On Sunday, she played a season-high 29 minutes and kept the Terps afloat in the first quarter. First came a spinning jumper in the paint, then a pair of free throws before she cut through the key for a layup. She closed the quarter with a three-pointer that gave Maryland a 24-18 lead. “Coming off the bench, we know that we need that spark,” said Kubek, who finished with a season-high 23 points and eight rebounds. “Bri got a lot of assists for me personally, so thanks, Bri. I don’t really think about my knee as much anymore. It’s kind of just playing at this point. ... I felt good today.” The second quarter was ugly for Maryland. Frese pointed to fatigue as her Terps shot 4 for 20 (20 percent) to head into halftime trailing 38-35. But Kubek and Mc Daniel took charge in the third, when they combined for eight points as the Terps rallied to take a 51-49 lead. Then Kubek hit three layups and Mc Daniel added three assists and a steal during an 8-0 run late in the quarter. Mc Daniel handled backup point guard duties while also boosting the Terps’ energy with her defense. Frese pressed on defense more than she had in previous games, and that also seemed to energize the Terps in the second half. Mc Daniel, a sophomore from Chicago, finished with a season-high 12 points to go with a career-high five assists. Sellers did a bit of everything on her way to 19 points, eight rebounds, five steals and three assists. Briggs added 10 points and six rebounds. “You need to be able to show that resiliency and that bounce-back,” Frese said of responding to the lopsided road losses. “Really, really important today for us to kind of fight through that fatigue to be able to pull this game out.” Maryland misfires again and again in drubbing by No. 21 Villanova Even after a Maryland run early in the fourth quarter extended the Terps’ lead to eight, Syracuse (3-1) never rolled over, and a Rice three-pointer with 23 seconds remaining cut the Orange’s deficit to 83-81. After a Brown-Turner turnover, Syracuse Coach Felisha Legette-Jack drew up a play for a three-pointer, but Maryland never gave Rice a chance to find a shooter. All five Syracuse starters scored in double figures. Guard Georgia Woolley led the way with 21 points to go with eight rebounds. “I love my team, love the fight that we came here with,” Legette-Jack said. “... We don’t play opponents. We play for our story. We can’t quit on our story.” The next chapter of the Terps’ story is the Cancún Challenge in Mexico, where they will face No. 24 Washington State on Thanksgiving, Green Bay on Friday and Massachusetts on Saturday.","November 19, 2023 at 5:29 p.m. EST",19.0,11.0,2023.0
294,Washington Post,"College football winners and losers: Once again, No. 5 Washington finds a way",,"Michael Penix Jr. wasn’t afforded the chance to take many arrows out of his quiver in the second half Saturday. The quarterback of No. 5 Washington made his last opportunity count, and in doing so ensured the Huskies remained undefeated and would play in the Pac-12 title game. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don’t miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news.Arrow Right With 1:58 to go, Penix zipped a third-down pass to Rome Odunze for 19 yards to seal the Huskies’ 22-20 victory at No. 11 Oregon State, overcoming a cold, soggy night and a methodical, patient opponent to remain firmly in the playoff picture. Buckner: In the Michigan sign-stealing dramedy, laughter is the only answer It wasn’t the first time the Penix-to-Odunze connection was crisp in Corvallis. The two connected on a pair of touchdown passes in the first half as Washington (11-0, 8-0 Pac-12) built a 22-10 lead. Oregon State (8-3, 5-3) figured out the best way to slow the Huskies down was to keep them off the field. The Beavers bled nearly 10 minutes of clock in the third quarter on a 16-play touchdown drive capped by Damien Martinez’s second touchdown run of the night. And a 10-play, 50-yard fourth-quarter drive covered 4 minutes, 42 seconds and netted a field goal to bring Oregon State within two. Meanwhile, Washington ran six plays in the third quarter and was forced to punt after a couple first downs when it got the ball back after the Beavers closed within 22-20. But as they have done repeatedly during Pac-12 play — against Oregon in a classic, against Arizona State in a battle for survival on an off night, against Southern California in a back-and-forth game devoid of defense — the Huskies won the one or two moments that mattered most. Forcing the Beavers into a fourth-down incompletion near midfield with 2:08 to go ended another lengthy possession that was closing in on six minutes. Penix’s throw to Odunze, after which he turned to his signature pantomime of shooting an arrow to savor the moment, clinched the outcome. After taking a knee three times, Penix and the Huskies made their escape. (One wonders what a Seattle athlete of a slightly earlier era, former Mariners closer Fernando Rodney, would think of their shared celebration). Oregon State’s ever-so-slim playoff hopes are done with the loss, as are its hopes of claiming a Pac-12 title in the face of 10 schools defecting to other leagues next season and leaving the Beavers and Washington State with a pile of money but an uncertain future. It wasn’t as if the Beavers could have hoped to contain Penix much better in the final 30 minutes. Washington managed only 69 yards and three first downs in the second half. But its lefty quarterback had a chance to shoot his shot, and he took full advantage of it. Navy honors its seniors, then pitches a shutout against East Carolina Two more victories — over Washington State in the annual showdown for the Apple Cup, and against either Oregon or Arizona in the Pac-12 title game — will provide the Huskies their greatest shot yet: A playoff berth to cap an already memorable season.

295,Washington Post,IBM pulls ads from X as Musk amplifies antisemitism,Will Oremus and Naomi Nix and Will Oremus and Naomi Nix,"IBM said Thursday it will stop advertising on X, formerly Twitter, after a report from a media watchdog organization found that its ads had appeared on the Elon Musk-owned social media site alongside pro-Nazi tweets. “IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” the company said in a statement. The report from the left-leaning nonprofit Media Matters for America, released Thursday, identified IBM as one of several blue-chip companies whose ads had appeared next to tweets that included endorsements of National Socialism, memes portraying Nazism as a spiritual awakening, and Adolf Hitler quotes presented in an inspirational style. The pullback by IBM is the latest blow to X chief executive Linda Yaccarino’s push to lure back advertisers who have fled the site since Musk bought it a little more than a year ago. While Musk has succeeded in his bid to loosen the site’s restrictions on speech, slashing staff who used to moderate offensive content, its business has suffered, with a financial outlook thatinsiders have called dire. The move from IBM came a day after Musk tweeted his agreement with an antisemitic conspiracy theory on the site, drawing fresh criticism from some civil rights leaders. Musk was replying to an X user who said a rise in online antisemitism was actually the fault of Jews for supporting “hordes of minorities” and promoting “hatred against whites.” The user said they have no sympathy for Jews who face hateful comments such as “Hitler was right.” Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth,” helping to amplify the user’s tweet to his vast online following. In a subsequent tweet, Musk went on to criticize the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that combats antisemitism and extremism, saying it “unjustly attacks the majority of the West” for anti-Jewish hate rather than “the minority groups who are their primary threat.” ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt fired back at Musk in a tweet Thursday, saying: “At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.” ADL is one of a coalition of 60 advocacy groups that have called for major advertisers to boycott the platform until Musk agrees to invest in enforcing the platform’s old content moderation rules. Musk and X did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. Without mentioning Musk’s tweet directly,Yaccarino published a tweet Thursday that appeared aimed at controlling the damage. “X’s point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board,” she wrote. Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, said of IBM’s decision to pull its ads, “Better late than never.” He added, “They’ve been a significant buyer. They’re one of the heavy spenders who not only never pulled their ads, but never even suggested” that they were concerned about Musk’s policies. Carusone said his organization’s research shows X can’t keep its own promises to let advertisers control the content they advertise alongside. “The extremism, the antisemitism, the white supremacy — it has tipped over to the point that you cannot insulate yourself from it.” Civil rights groups and other advocates have taken issue with a wide range of changes that Musk has implemented including the company’s decision to dismantle its old system of verifying high-profile figures in favor of a subscription service. Musk has also reinstated once-booted account users, rolled back the company’s rules against covid-19 misinformation and gutted teams that were in charge of keeping the platform free of toxic content. At stake is both X’s advertising business, which Yaccarino has been struggling to revive, and Musk’s increasingly influential role on the global stage. Musk had been scheduled to speak at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week in San Francisco, but his appearance was canceled Thursday. A spokesperson for APEC did not respond to a request for comment on whether Musk’s tweets had led to the cancellation. Meanwhile, rising hate speech and extremist content on X has put mainstream news outlets and civil rights groups in a tough position. Many of those groups still see the platform as a critical forum to share and comment on the news, even as they evaluate or criticize Musk’s attempts to turn X into a free speech haven. While Elon Musk’s “misguided decisions” have made “the platform more toxic and frankly a cesspool,” it’s still more popular than its competitors, said Free Press Senior Counsel Nora Benavidez, whose group helped organize the advertiser boycott against X. “I think it’s going to take time though, to see a full migration away from Twitter and we need creators and others to take up those alternative platforms.” The New York Times, which has been the subject of fierce criticism by Musk, nevertheless plans to host him at its annual Dealbook conference later this month. The Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The ADL also remains a presence on X, even though Musk has sparred with it and even threatened to sue it, claiming the organization spearheaded an advertiser boycott that has dented X’s business — a claim the ADL has denied. The organization plans to continue to advertise on the site, spokesperson Jake Hyman said Thursday. “ADL needs our message to be where the antisemites and extremists are and those who may be influenced by them,” Hyman said. “Twitter/X remains a major social media platform with a massive general audience, the majority of whom do not wish to be exposed to hateful content, including those who are looking for ways to help protect themselves and others from that content.” Thursday evening, a group of 164 Jewish leadersreiterated their callfor large advertisers including Disney, Apple and Amazon to stop “funding X through their ad spend,” and called on Apple and Google to remove it from their app stores. “None of this is surprising: Musk has been spreading antisemitism now for years,” the religious leaders wrote. “What is surprising is how many tech companies and leaders are still willing to do business with him.”","November 16, 2023 at 8:49 p.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0
296,Washington Post,L.A. schools settle with student barred from promoting plant-based milk,Laura Reiley and Laura Reiley,"The Los Angeles Unified School District hassettled a lawsuit brought bya former student who said the district curbed her free speech rights by limiting her ability to criticize the consumption of cow’s milk at school. Marielle Williamson, a 2023 Eagle Rock High School graduate, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit medical ethics organization, had sued the school system and the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this year after she was told she could not share literature alleging that the dairy industry harms human health, animals and the environment. Animal rights groups expressed hope that it could be a blow to cow’s milk being the default beverage option in American schools. As part of the settlement, the school district said it will support giving free soy milk to students who request it. Williamson said she was grateful both sides were able to reach an agreement that enshrines the free speech rights of students. “The changes ensure that other students who want to speak openly about dairy have the ability to do so,” she said. “I’m also excited that these permanent changes will create an improved system that focuses on what is better for both student health and student voices.” At issue for Williamson was her school’s policy against providing plant-based alternatives to milk at lunch without a doctor’s note. She had requested an alternative, but not on the basis of a medical disability. Rather, she was taking an ethical stance on the use of animal dairy. She chose to protest this decision by distributing literature sharing her views promoting nondairy milk at her high school. But she was told by administrators that it wasn’t allowed unless she also extolled the virtues of cow’s dairy. Milk shake-up: High school student sues school district over dairy flap “By compelling Marielle to simultaneously distribute the dairy misinformation that she seeks to refute, District Defendants have violated Marielle’s free speech rights,” her lawyers argued in the suit filed in May. “More than that, [the defendants] have laid bare the extent to which [USDA] treats dairy as sacrosanct, both as a matter of law and policy.” In the settlement notice, the district acknowledged that setting up tables and displays to express students’ personal views during noninstructional time is protected free speech, and that even criticism of dairy is protected by First Amendment laws. “Los Angeles Unified takes pride in empowering students to amplify their voice on issues they find important,” Shannon Haber, a Los Angeles Unified spokeswoman, said in a statement about the settlement. “Our Food Services Program follows USDA guidelines and we continue to support our students with nutritious meals and healthy alternatives for those who have specific dietary requests and requirements.” Williamson said she is hopeful that the settlement with the school district is predictive of a similar positive outcome with the USDA, which was also named in the lawsuit. USDA declined to comment on the settlement but said it “remains committed to ensuring that its child nutrition programs, including school meals, are powerful tools to ensure that children, regardless of race, ethnicity or background, have access to nutritious and affordable food.” By law, “fluid milk,” or cow’s milk, must be offered at every school lunch and breakfast served under the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program. Federal lawsays that any school participating in USDA’s school lunch program “shall not directly or indirectly restrict the sale or marketing of fluid milk products by the school (or by a person approved by the school) at any time or any place.” The USDA interprets that language to mean that cafeteria displays, printed material and layout may not promote beverages other than dairy milk in a way that may detract from dairy milk sales. Even water may not be offered on the lunch linein a waythat might interfere with a student taking milk. Moooove over: How single-celled yeasts are doing the work of 1,500-pound cows Critics have decried USDA guidelines requiring milk to be served with public school lunches, in part because so many Americans are lactose intolerant or sensitive. Because many people don’t seek a medical diagnosis for these symptoms, compulsory dairy in school meals could be seen as punitive or culturally insensitive, critics say. In 2018, the American Medical Associationpassed a resolutionencouraging the USDA to “recognize that lactose intolerance is a common and normal condition among many Americans, especially African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans,” and called for legislation to modify the National School Lunch Act to eliminate the need for a doctor’s note for a child to receive cow’s milk alternatives in school. Approximately75 percentof the LAUSD student population is Latino/Hispanic. The USDA reimburses schools for every meal served, and cow’s milk is included. Lactose-free and nondairy options are sometimes offered, but typicallyare more expensive andan added cost that comes out of schools’ budgets. As part of the settlement, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine agreed to make a donation to subsidize the price of soy milk, which is pricier than cow’s milk.","November 17, 2023 at 9:56 a.m. EST",17.0,11.0,2023.0
297,Washington Post,UAW workers at General Motors ratify contract with record wage gains,Jeanne Whalen and Lauren Kaori Gurley and Jeanne Whalen and Lauren Kaori Gurley,"United Auto Workers at General Motors on Thursday approved a contract with record wage gains and other worker-friendly provisions, marking one of the starkest wins yet in a year of victories for the labor movement. A ratification vote at Ford also looks very likely to pass, while a third at Jeep-maker Stellantis is likewise trending in that direction. Those results will be known within days. More than 54 percent of 35,000 UAW workers at GM who cast ballots approved the contract, a unionvote trackershowed. The UAW did not immediately offer comment. GM declined to comment until the union formally announces the results. The contracts offer larger wage increases than UAW workers have received in the past 22 years combined. Base wages for the highest-paid workers will grow by 25 percent over the 4½ year contract to more than $40 an hour. Cost of living adjustments will boost that wage further, to more than $42 an hour. The contract also eliminateslower wage tiersthat left newer workers with worse pay, a move that will dramatically raise their earnings. The lowest-paid temp workers hired this year at $16.67 will get a 158 percent raise to more than $42 an hour by the end of the contract, including cost of living adjustments, the union said. That focus on lifting the lowest-paid workers has been a common theme across new labor contracts signed this year, from UPS workers to Hollywood actors, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University. “The labor movement in general had intense focus on trying to raise the lowest-paid workers,” Wheaton said. “At UPS it was not about the drivers, it was about the people who load the trucks and move the boxes and work in the warehouse. At SAG-AFTRA it wasn’t about getting Tom Cruise more money. It was about the 80 percent of the members who do not make $35,000 a year and therefore do not qualify for the SAG-AFTRA health insurance benefit.” With the new contracts “it’s overwhelmingly much more equal,” he said. That larger benefit for the lowest paid was also what made the GM vote close. Five of GM’s largest plants voted the deal down in the past few days, with some veteran workers voicing opposition about receiving a lower raise relative to others. Some workers said they were also disappointed that the union failed in its aim to reinstate defined-benefit pensions and retiree health care for all workers. But the contract does boost the company’s contributions to 401(k) accounts to equal 10 percent of a workers’ wages. It also offers more paid time off and gives workers the right to strike over any plant closures during the life of the contract — a right the UAW views as important to protecting jobs. Marc Robinson, a former General Motors economist and strategist, said he was surprised that so many UAW members voted against “such a rich contract” but chalked it up to newly elected union president Shawn Fainpublicly making very bold demands throughout the contract fight and setting high standards for what workers could win. “[The union] probably got a better deal than usual because the companies weren’t used to Fain’s strategy, but it came with the risk of raising members’ expectations,” Robinson said. “The close vote reflects the extraordinarily high expectations.” How a brash, little-known union leader won record gains for autoworkers The contract comes after a long period of worker wagesnot keeping upwith inflation, and after the union gave up some of its benefits around the time of the Great Recession, when the automakers were struggling to survive. The union managed to claw back many of those perks in the new deals, including restoring regular cost of living wage adjustments to offset inflation. Another reason for the challenging vote among GM workers is that it’s possible that leaders of UAW locals might not have effectively sold the deal to union members, Robinson said. The division could reflect the fact that “there is no unanimity within the UAW,” he said, noting that Fain only narrowly unseated his predecessor in a runoff election seven months ago. The deal also appears to offer UAW workers some protection in the industry’s conversion to electric vehicles. Workers haveworriedthat wages and job security will be lower in the industry’s new battery and EV factories. The GM agreement includes language wrapping some of these new factories into the union’s main contracts with the automaker. What exactly that will mean for wages of those in battery plants is not yet clear, however. The negotiations were at times extremely acrimonious, with the automakers balking at Fain’s brash style and big demands. Fain regularly railed against “corporate greed” and “the billionaire class” during Facebook Live addresses to his members, and called out the automaker CEOs for earning lucrative pay packages of more than $20 million a year. The big contract gains are spilling over to benefit non-unionized autoworkers, too. Toyota, Honda and Hyundai have given their U.S. employees double-digit pay increases in recent days, in what analysts see as an attempt to prevent their factories from unionizing. Fain has vowed to unionize as many automakers beyond the Big Three as possible, saying that this will be the UAW’s focus once the Big Three contracts are ratified. Jacob Tomek has worked for General Motors at the Lansing Redistribution Center for a year and said he is optimistic about the contract, calling those who voted against it “selfish or misinformed.” His wages will go up to $25.10 an hour from $17 an hour with the new contract. Tomek has just bought a house and plans on using his increased salary to pay it off. “If I were to go around and ask every UAW member to come up with a contract they thought was fair, they’d each come up with different contracts,"" he said. Heather Wilder, a UAW member at the Lansing Redistribution Plant, voted against the agreement, saying that the new contract leaves retirees in the dust. The new contract would raise her wages by $5 to $36 an hour, but she wanted to see improvements to health-care and retiree benefits. Wilder said there won’t be any tension at the plant despite the close vote. When employees “start collecting their salary and raise,” life will carry on until the next contract, she said.","November 16, 2023 at 6:51 p.m. EST",16.0,11.0,2023.0

""And I look what Iran is doing in the region and everywhere it's implanted itself, everywhere it controls its proxies....They've brought misery and bloodshed to those countries."" ""The crazed, murderous glee of murdering human beings, beheading human beings, burning human beings, massacring human beings. That's what Iran stands for,"" he added. Netanyahu said that he also recognized ""resolve and courage"" coming from Americans on the topic of fighting terrorism, despite pro-Hamas sentiment in parts of the U.S. ""But some [Americans] are misguided and some are woefully misguided by a media that broadcasts essentially Hamas claims...They're saying blame Israel, not Hamas,"" the Israeli leader explained. ""Blame the allies, not the new Nazis. Blame America in this case and not bin Laden for the casualties [of the War on Terror].""

""Today, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said something utterly preposterous,"" Netanyahu said in a video on X on Sunday. ""It denied that it was Hamas that carried out the horrible massacre at the nature festival near Gaza. It actually accused Israel of carrying out that massacre. This is a complete reversal of truth"" Netanyahu criticized Mahmood Abbas, who also goes by Abu Mazin, of denying both the Holocaust and the anti-Israeli attacks by Hamas. ""My goal is that the day after we destroy Hamas, any future civil administration in Gaza does not deny the massacre, does not educate its children to become terrorists, does not pay for terrorists and does not tell its children that their ultimate goal in life is to see the destruction and dissolution of the State of Israel,"" Netanyahu's statement added. ""That's not acceptable and that is not the way to achieve peace.""   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have released new video reportedly showing hostages being taken into Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza on October 7. The CCTV video appears to show a group of men taking an injured man into the hospital. The group, which included armed men, appeared to run through the hospital's lobby. Another shot of the footage shows a bleeding man in a stretcher being taken into a different room. The group of men huddled around him. ""In the documentation exposed with the assistance of the ISA, Hamas terrorists can be seen on Saturday, October 7th, forcibly transporting hostages, a Nepalese civilian and a Thai civilian, who were kidnapped from Israeli territory,"" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said on X. ""These findings prove that the Hamas terrorist organization used the Shifa Hospital complex on the day of the massacre as terrorist infrastructure."" ""These findings add to previous evidence presented regarding Hamas’ use of the hospital area as infrastructure for its terrorist activities in a systematic and ongoing manner,"" he added.  Source: IDF via X  In a social media post on Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces(IDF) honored a fallen soldier who donated his organs to save the lives of others.

Israeli Defense Forces are responding to continued missile launches by Hezbollah terrorists into northern Israel on Sunday. The Israeli militaryhas launched attacks on Hezbollah sites in Lebanon throughout the weekend. The Iran-backed terrorist group has continued to ramp up its attacks, launching rockets and anti-tank missiles at a growing pace. The U.S. has sought to deter Iran and its proxies from joining the war against Israel, but with little success. In a social media post on X, the IDF said that a Hezbollah military compound, a military post and other infrastructure were targeted. ""Several anti-tank missiles and mortar shell launches toward northern Israel were identified,"" the IDF's statement said. ""The launches were not intercepted according to protocol."" ""Interceptors were launched toward a suspicious target. The IDF is striking the origins of the fire,"" the statement added. Fox News Digital's Andrea Vacchiano contributed to this report.  United Nations slammed for silence over Hamas rapes, mutilation and murder of Israeli women  Women’s rights groups and officials in Israel who have been working tirelessly for the past six weeks to document cases of rape and gender-basedatrocities carried out by Hamas terroristsduring their mass, brutal terror attack in Israel on Oct. 7., say the United Nations is ignoring them. They have also shared much of this evidence, some of it horrifyingly graphic and all of it extremely intimate, with the United Nations and groups that protect and empower women. The response: Silence. ""We’ve sent letters and shared graphic documentation,"" Sarah Weiss Maudi, a senior diplomat and legal adviser in Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Fox News Digital. ""Their silence is so deafening that it’s sickening."" Fox News' Ruth Marks Eglash contributed to this report   Israeli Defense Forcesrevealed footage of an extensive tunnel they say stretches underneath Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital on Sunday. The footage comes after weeks of Israeli and U.S. intelligence stating that Hamas had placed its headquarters in tunnels underneath the hospital complex. ""IDF and ISA forces revealed a significant 55-meter-long terrorist tunnel, 10 meters underneath the Shifa Hospital complex during an intelligence-based operation,"" the IDF wrote in a statement. ""The tunnel entrance contains various defense mechanisms, such as a blast-proof door and a firing hole, in an attempt by Hamas to block Israeli forces from entering. ""For weeks we've been telling the world about Hamas' cynical use of the residents of the Gaza and patients of Shifa Hospital as human shields,"" the statement continued.  Top Democrat champions hostage deal ahead of Thanksgiving, though staunchly rejects ceasefire  Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., championed news of a possible deal to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas ahead of Thanksgiving, but rejected calls for a cease-fire in Gaza. Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear that there is a difference between acease-fire in Gaza and humanitarian pauses. ""Well, let's draw a distinction here,"" Coons told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream, ""between a cease-fire – some folks are calling for a cease-fire and protests across Europe and in our country, by which they mean Israel should stop fighting Hamas, should end their campaign in Gaza – or a pause that has been negotiated between Israel and Hamas to allow the release of hostages, Israeli and American and other nationality hostages, and allow them food and fuel and medicine to get into Gaza. A negotiated brief pause in the fighting, I think would be a good thing, and I would strongly support. A cease-fire, meaning an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas. I don't support and neither does the president."" ""News of a potential hostage deal, Shannon, is great news just before Thanksgiving for the 10 American families whose loved ones are being held hostage and the more than 230 others. I've met with those families, Shannon, in Tel Aviv, and in Washington, and it's heartbreaking to be with parents who don't know how their children are doing and who believe they are being held in tunnels… beneath Gaza,"" he said. ""This is a good development today."" The Washington Post first reported Saturday that the United States, Israel and Hamas had reached a tentative agreement to release an initial 50 or more hostages in smaller groups every 24 hours. The release could begin within the next several days, according to reports. Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report   Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says Israel is doing everything it canto avoid civilian casualties in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Christie made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' The 2024 Republican presidential candidate said he is ""absolutely"" confident that the Israeli Defense Forces are following international law in the conflict as well.   Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reacted to polling that shows 73% of Americans are worried about an Islamic terrorist attack on U.S. soilon ‘FOX News Sunday.’ Pompeo said the best way to prevent an attack in the U.S.--and to protect civilians in Gaza--is for Israel to speedily defeat Hamas in Gaza. The former Trump administration official stated that if Hamas is not destroyed, more attacks like the October 7 massacre are a certainty.  Netanyahu war cabinet stifles revolt from far right over sending Gazans fuel without hostage deal  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly trying to quell anuprising from far-right membersof his government over his concession to send about two trucks of fuel per day into Gaza before securing the release of hundreds of hostages still held by Hamas. Nentanyhu, facing mounting pressure from President Biden and the West, reportedly agreed on Friday to send 60,000 liters of fuel, or about two trucks per day, into Gaza in order to prevent the sewer system from collapsing and deter further humanitarian crises, according to Politico. That represents just about 3.5% of the amount of fuel allowed into Gaza before the war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a right-wing leader, has deemed allowing fuel into Gaza ""a grave mistake."" He argued Netanyahu's war cabinet, which consists of three people, including the prime minister himself, should be expanded so that all seven parties in the coalition government have a seat. Without daily fuel deliveries, some argue the sewer system in Gaza would break down and risk the spread of infectious disease, endangering both civilians and Israeli troops. ""If plague were to break out, we’d have to stop the war,"" National Security Council chairman Tzachi Hanegbi told reporters Friday. But Itamar Ben Gvir, the ministeroverseeing Israel’s police,contended that ""so long as our hostages don’t even get a visit from the Red Cross, there’s no sense in giving the enemy humanitarian gifts,"" according to Politico. Allowing fuel, Gvir said, ""broadcasts weakness, gives oxygen to the enemy and allows [Hamas Gaza leader Yahya] Sinwar to sit comfortably in his air-conditioned bunker, watch the news and continue to manipulate Israeli society and the families of the abductees."" Fox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report  White House responds to Pentagon doubts over Biden's actions to 'deter' Iran  The White House National Security Council pushed back on reports of division within the Defense Department of President Biden's efforts to deter Iran from widening Israel's war against Hamas on Sunday. The Washington Post reported on grumblings at the Pentagon over the appearent ineffectiveness of U.S. policy toward Iran. Iran's proxy terrorist groups have attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria roughly 60 times since October 17, leading many to question what exactly Biden is deterring. “There’s no clear definition of what we are trying to deter,” one defense official told the Post. “Are we trying to deter future Iranian attacks like this? Well, that’s clearly not working.” Watson responded in a Sunday statement, arguing that Biden has taken significant actions todeter Iran from joining the warin Israel. ""President Biden has shown he will never hesitate to take action to protect U.S. forces. He has directed the U.S. military to conduct precision air strikes in response to recent attacks against U.S. forces who are in Iraq and Syria to help defeat ISIS, and he is fully prepared to take further measures as needed at any given moment to protect our people,"" she said. Fox News' Sarah Tobianski contributed to this report   Evangelical leader Franklin Graham met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. Graham, the president of Samaritan's Purse, joined Fox News on Sunday to discuss his visit. He was the firstevangelical leader to visit Israelsince war broke out on October 7. Graham said he spent time praying with Netanyahu during the visit and said the leader is ""laser focused"" on ending the conflict and freeing the hostages.  US believes 'vast majority' of Hamas hostages are 'most likely' alive  The U.S. believes the vast majority of hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 are still alive. Deputy National Security Adviser John Finer made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's 'This Week.' He said hostage negotiations between the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Hamaswere ongoing and extremely sensitive. Finer said that while the U.S. could not confirm the condition of the hostages, at least a large majority of them are still believed to be alive. ""The United States government does not speak directly with them. But we do believe that a significant number and most likely the majority and even the vast majority of hostages are alive,"" Finer said. ""We are certainly operating under that assumption, and we are going to work to get as many of them out. Certainly, including, by the way, a number of Americans who we believe are held hostage as we can. But we do not have perfect clarity. We are not on the ground.""   Israeli officials warnedof a ""grave incidient"" after Iran-backed terrorists in Yemen hijacked an international cargo vessel in the Red Sea on Sunday. The Houthi terrorist group had claimed to have captured an ""Israeli"" ship, but Israel says none of the crew on board are Israeli. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office says the ship is owned by a British company and operated by a Japanese company. ""The hijacking of a cargo ship by the Houthis near Yemen in the southern Red Sea is a very grave incident of global consequence.The ship departed Turkey on its way to India, staffed by civilians of various nationalities, not including Israelis. It is not an Israeli ship,"" The IDF said in a statement. Israel says the ship's crew includes 25 crew members of various nationalities, including Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Filipinos and Mexicans. ""We strongly condemn the Iranian attack against an international ship,"" the PM's office said.

LA Times editorial board demands Biden admin push for a 'cease-fire' in the Israel-Hamas war  The Los Angeles Times editorial board is arguing for acease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war,following weeks of fighting after Hamas launched the October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel. The editorial board claimed that it ""has become impossible to distinguish between Israel’s decidedly non-surgical operation against Hamas militants in Gaza and the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians."" ""It is time for a cease-fire,"" the board wrote. ""It is time for the Biden administration to assert strong and sustained pressure on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to stop attacks that have reportedly already killed more than 11,000 Gazans. The world cannot stand by to witness more slaughter of civilians."" ""Remaining mindful of America’s mistakes, it is incumbent upon the Biden administration now to avoid complicity with Israel’s,"" the board wrote. ""We are past the time to excuse the horror in Gaza. Biden has to press Netanyahu hard to stop the mass, indiscriminate killing. That starts with a call for a cease-fire."" The board conceded that while Hamas is a ""radical militant organization"" that also is in control of the Gaza government, ""Hamas’ atrocities do not justify atrocities in kind."" Fox News' Jeffrey Clark contributed to this report  Musk says X users calling for 'genocide of any group' face suspension after antisemitism allegations  Tech billionaire Elon Musk promised to suspend anyone advocating for the ""genocide of any group"" from his X platform after being accused ofamplifying an antisemitic tropeearlier in the week. ""At risk of stating the obvious, anyone advocating the genocide of *any* group will be suspended from this platform,"" Musk wrote in a post on X. ""As I said earlier this week,‘decolonization’,‘from the river to the sea’ and similar euphemisms necessarily imply genocide. Clear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will result in suspension,"" Musk wrote. Musk faced some backlash earlier in the week over an exchange on X. Charles Weber, who identifies himself as a Jewish conservative, wrote to his 14,800 followers, ""To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right’: You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces…"" Fox Business' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report  Over a million Palestinians in Gaza are displaced, why are Arab countries not opening their doors?  At a summit of leaders from more than 50 Arab and Muslim states held last weekend in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,Israel’s military responsein Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre was fiercely condemned. But what was missing from the gathering’s final statement was any immediate solution for the 2.3 million civilians of the Palestinian enclave, more than half of whom are now internally displaced after nearly six weeks of fighting. While the final resolution called for an immediate end to ""the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza"" and made offers of humanitarian and financial aid to the Palestinians, not one country came forward with a viable solution, even temporarily, for the 1.5 million civilians who, according to the latest U.N. figures, are now internally displaced in the southern section of the Strip. As the death toll in Gaza rises, thousands of civilians continue to flee the conflict and head southward, where the Israeli military has said it is safer and where truckloads of food, water, and medicine arrive daily via the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. The U.N. estimates 250,000 fled in the past week alone. Some have questioned why nearby Arab countries, who have provided temporary shelter in the past to civilians from other regional conflicts, appear unwilling to even discusssheltering the refugees from Gaza. ""Arab states have historically been divided with regard to their stance on the Palestinian people and numerous other significant issues,"" Ahed Al-Hindi, a senior fellow at the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital. ""Although these states project solidarity with the Palestinian people, they hold divergent views on the most effective course of action."" Fox News' Ruth Marks Eglash contributed to this report  Israeli forces uncover explosives laboratory in overnight West Bank raid  Israeli secuirity and special forces conducted multiple overnight raids in the West Bank on Sunday, arresting 38 people and interrogating dozens more. The raids targeted alleged terrorist activity in the Jenin and Balata refugee camps. The IDF says it confiscated 10 firearms and located ""a number of warehouses containing improvised explosive devices,"" as well as a labratory for making explosives, according to spokesman Daniel Hagari. ""Since the beginning of the war, approximately 1,800 wanted persons have been arrested throughout the Judea and Samaria Division and the Bekaa and Valleys Division, approximately 1,100 of whom are affiliated with Hamas,"" Israeli forces said in a statement. Israel has conducteda slew of operations in the West Bank in tandem with its war against Hamas in Gaza.    Israeli president marks 'terrifying surge of antisemitism' in global message to Jews  Israeli President Isaac Herzog made a global message to Jews on Sunday,warning them of increasing antisemitism,but nevertheless stating that Israel ""is thriving in spite of it all."" Herzog's statement came on the heels of his virtual appearance at the March for Israel in Washington, D.C. last week, where tens of thousands of pro-Israel demonstrators gathered. “This is not only a war between Israel and Hamas. Israel may be fighting on the ground, but it is fighting the battle of the entire civilized world. We are determined to stand up to this evil,"" Herzog said. “In the wake of the massacres, we have seen a terrifying surge of antisemitism throughout the world. This fact has exposed the close link between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment."" ""Sisters and brothers, outside my window here in Jerusalem, I see an Israel that is thriving in spite of it all. As I speak, our sons and daughters in uniform are on the frontlines fighting to protect us. Israelis of every background are showing up for each other in remarkable ways. Jewish communities across the world are mobilizing with unprecedented energy. I receive offers of support and solidarity from every corner of the globe. Kol Yisrael Areyvim Ze La Ze. Israel is here for you, and you are here for Israel,"" he added.  AIDS conspiracies to antisemitism: Inside Bin Laden's deranged letter picking up new support online  Usama bin Laden, the Islamic jihadist who organized the 9/11 attacks against Americans over 20 years ago, has been back in the headlines this week after his""Letter to America"" picked up attentionon social media amid Israel's war against Hamas. But those promoting it appear to be glossing over the deranged conspiracy theories and threats that the terror honcho pushes in the diatribe. The two-decades-old piece of jihadist propaganda was wiped from The Guardian’s website earlier this week due to a surge in attention — ""without full context"" — it was getting after some influencers on Tik Tok began talking about it. Some users said it changed their worldviews. Others went as far as to say they realized bin Laden ""was right."" Part of bin Laden's letter blamed America for supporting the ""Israeli oppression of the Palestinians"" and ""the occupation"" in the Holy Land. After the trend gained some traction on Tik Tok, with 274 videos posted under the hashtag from Tuesday to Wednesday, a compilation of videos was uploaded again to X and gained over 35 million views, surpassing the 1.85 million views originally gained on Tik Tok. Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report  Democrat Socialist members of Congress have not condemned violent anti-Israel protest targeting DNC  Members of Congress belonging to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have not condemned the violentanti-Israel protestthat targeted the headquarters of their own party in Washington, D.C., this week. The offices of representatives Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Greg Casar, D-Texas; and Cori Bush, D-Mo., did not respond to Fox News Digital's multiple requests for comment concerning the violence that erupted Wednesday when pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war rioted outside the Democratic National Committee (DNC). None have released a public statement addressing the violence, other than Bush sharing a statement on X from left-wing group If Not Now Movement blasting House Speaker Mike Johnson for his criticism of the protest. U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) responded to what they said were 150 people ""illegally and violently protesting"" near the DNC headquarters building in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The ensuing clash led to a number of injuries to police and protesters and led to the evacuation of multiple Democratic members of Congress and candidates attending a reception inside the building at the time. USCP confirmed on X that six officers were injured during the clash, which included injuries ranging from minor cuts and pepper spray burns and punches from protesters.

303,Fox News,'THE GAP IS GONE'NBC correspondent sounds alarm on more bad poll results for Biden,Hanna Panreck,"NBC political correspondent Steve Kornacki sounded the alarm on NBC's latest poll showing Donald Trump beating Joe Biden for the first time in the poll's history. NBC political correspondent Steve Kornacki sounded the alarm on a new NBC poll that showed former President Trump beating President Biden in a hypothetical general match-up for the first time in the NBC poll'shistory. Trump came out ahead of Biden in another general election match-up poll at 46%, with 44% supporting the president. Kornacki pointed to additional poll results and said that Biden has long had an advantage over Trump in ""likability,"" but according to NBC's latest results, was now tied. ""The gap is gone. Thirty-six percent positive on both and actually Biden, one point more negative than Trump. That's been a significant advantage for Biden, our poll says that advantage, at least for now, may be gone,"" Kornacki said. Kornacki also highlighted Biden's approval rating in the NBC poll, which he said was the lowest the president has ever measured in their polling. Just 40% of registered voters approve of Biden's job performance, the poll found. An NBC poll released on Sunday showed Donald Trump ahead of President Biden in a 2024 general election match-up.(Left:  (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images), Right: (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)) MEDIA IN A TIZZY AFTER POLL SHOWS TRUMP LEADING BIDEN IN KEY STATES: ‘THE HISSY FITS ARE ALREADY INCREDIBLE’ Among Independents, only 30% of registered voters approved of Biden's job performance. ""If you take a look here by party, I think it’s significant for two reasons: one, Independents, obviously, more than two to one disapprove. You don’t want to be there as an incumbent president. But I think equally significant, no surprise, 7% of Republicans approve of Joe Biden, job performance, but three times as many Democrats, 21%, that’s more than one in five, say they disapprove. You need much more unified support in your own party if you're going to have a successful reelection campaign,"" Kornacki said. He also revealed that younger voters, 18-24, were leaning towards Donald Trump. The poll found that 46% of voters ages 18-24 preferred Trump, and 42% said they preferred Biden. ""The youngest voters in the 2020 election were Biden +28,"" Kornacki noted. ""This could be a massive sea change.""

Voters were also sour on Biden's handling of foreign policy, the poll found, as just 33% approve of Biden's foreign policy job performance. ""These numbers surprised our own pollsters, Steve,"" NBC's Kristen Welker said, explaining the results. ""With one saying he cannot remember a time when a foreign entanglement that didn't involve U.S. troops had the capacity to transform the electorate. That's not the case in this poll.""

Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and Never Back Down Communications director Erin Perrine join ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss how endorsements will benefit the respective De Santis and Trump campaigns. Texas Gov.Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced in a social media post on Sunday that he is ""proud to endorse"" former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination. ""Today, I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President,""Abbott said in a poston X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Now more than ever, America needs a President who will secure the border and prioritize national security. President Trump is the clear choice to get the job done."" The former president joined the governor in Edinburg, Texas on Sunday for Abbott’s annual pre-Thanksgiving tradition of serving tamales to Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and Texas National Guardsmen deployed along the southern border under the governor’s Operation Lone Star program. TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT TO ENDORSE TRUMP FOR 2024 GOP NOMINATION WHEN THEY TEAM UP SUNDAY NEAR US-MEXICO BORDER The visit is intended to spotlight the combustible issue of illegal immigration and border security. The border has been a major issue for Republican voters and GOP leaders and politicians for two and a half years, leading to harsh criticism of President Biden’s administration’s handling of the crisis and a surge in border crossings by migrants. Trump pledged to launch the largest mass deportation effort in American history if he is re-elected and would reinstate travel bans and his 2019 ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers aiming to enter the U.S. at the southern border to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their cases.

He overwhelmingly won the renomination in March 2022 before defeating his Democratic challenger, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke last November to secure a third term as governor. Abbott was grateful for Trump's early endorsement last cycle, according to those in the governor's political orbit, and he's now apparently returning the favor.

308,Fox News,OUTKICKJim Harbaugh faces shocking punishment in 2024,Unknown," You are here: by David Hookstead November 19, 2023, 9:47 amupdated November 19, 2023, 1:41 pm5Comments Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh might not be on the sidelines next year if he chooses to stay in Ann Arbor. The Wolverinesare 11-0 going into the Ohio State game, but the team has been without Harbaugh for the past two games as he serves athree-game suspensionhanded down by the Big Ten. The B1G suspended Harbaughon game days for Connor Stalions (known as CIA Stalions to some) running a massive cheating operation to steal signs in violation of NCAA rules. While the Big Ten’s investigation of Harbaugh and Michigan is likely closed for good, the NCAA’s investigation is not at all. The NCAA was previously investigating Harbaugh for recruiting violations during the COVID period – which resulted in Michigan suspending the team’s head coach three games to start the year – and it’s also diving into the sign stealing scheme. The NCAA reportedly might be ready to absolutely hammer Harbaugh, according to Bruce Feldman. “It would not be surprising if Jim Harbaugh, if he’s still the coach at Michigan, could be suspended for the bulk of the 2024 season, I’m told,” Feldman reported Saturday. You can listen to Feldman’s full report below, and send me your thoughts to David.Hookstead@outkick.com. ""It would not be surprising if Jim Harbaugh could be suspended for the bulk of the 2024 season, I'm told.""@Bruce Feldman CFBbreaks down the Harbaugh suspension and his future at Michigan ⬇️pic.twitter.com/7b1A8t7UIf Bruce Feldman is one of the best college football reporters in America. If he says something, there’s reason to believe it’s absolutely credible and correct. The man is a star in the college football field. That’s why this report should make Michigan fans unbelievably nervous. If Harbaugh is facing a suspension for the “bulk” of the 2024 season, then there’s almost no chance he returns. Why would he? Why would anyone choose to stay in college football and deal with a massive suspension if the NFL is waiting? Jim Harbaugh will almost certainly get several interviews for head coaching positions. While most coaches who leave college for the NFL fail, Harbaugh has already been a very solid NFL coach. Harbaugh still has to sit out the Ohio State game, and then he’ll be eligible to return for any bowl game or College Football Playoff spot. If there’s more punishment coming down the pipeline, then prepare for serious conversations about Harbaugh leaving. It would be insane for him to stay in Ann Arbor if he can’t coach for the “bulk” of next year. Let me know what you think Harbaugh should do at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. college football Jim Harbaugh Michigan Michigan Wolverines NFL David Hookstead is a reporter for Out Kick covering a variety of topics with a focus on football and culture. He also hosts of the podcast American Joyridethat is accessible on Outkick where he interviews American heroes and outlines their unique stories. Before joining Out Kick, Hookstead worked for the Daily Caller for seven years covering similar topics. Hookstead is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Certain high-profile “celebrities” in sports, politics, entertainment simply have a “Reverse IT Factor”.  It makes them easily unlikeable for anyone not with “their team / party”.  It can be their physical appearance, their style of communicating, or a combination of factors …. Jim Harbaugh bears that burden … perhaps well-deserved, maybe not … but he bears it nonetheless.  …. Donald Trump (and Nancy Pelosi) might be the quintessential example.  “Coach K” was another example.  Such personalities are very unsympathetic. No one outside of his partisans is going to feel sorry for whatever retribution awaits him. “Harbaugh has already been a very solid NFL coach.” He may be considered by many to be a solid coach in the NFL, but there are a few caveats to that. The team he inherited in San Francisco was completely loaded. They hadn’t had a winning record in 8 years and had been selecting near the top of the draft. The coaches had been terrible… bozo Jed York had most recently hired Jim Tomsula and Mike Singletary. Any competent coach could have taken the talent that Singletary/Tomsula left behind to a greater height. Harbaugh did. His last season was 8-8, though. Second, he couldn’t play well with his co-workers in the front office. He blew up his relationships and pulled an unsuccessful power play that resulted in him leaving to Michigan. Third, the word is the NFL doesn’t want to be seen as a safe haven from coaches who are fleeing penalties at the NCAA level. They’re supposedly going to enforce any multigame suspension the NCAA hands down. Yeah, Harbaugh will get a new gig in the NFL but he’s not all that and please don’t let him wind up with my team! Not that it matters, but Harbaugh has never won a championship at any level. Head coach, college coach, pro player, college player, all the way back to high school. It would be ironic to say the least if, worst-case scenario, he wins the championship game with Michigan only to have it vacated later by the NCAA. That would be overly tragic even for some of the haters. Michigan already sees him as both a conquering hero and now a martyr as well. Unless he stands to lose an incredible amount of money, why wouldn’t he just ride out a suspension, focus tons of time and energy on recruiting and shmoozing boosters and potential NIL partners? He would come back stronger than ever and the fans would go nuts for him. Seems simple to me. Good analysis (aka common sense).If Harbaugh were offered a mega package such as top-level salary along with multiple hats including GM and VP, he would probably make the jump. Similar to Mike Holmgren going to the Seahawks as head coach, GM, and executive vice president. Right now only Belichick, Pete Carroll, and Ron Rivera have GM powers. Make Jim Harbaugh feel like he’s one of the top dogs (like he wanted from SF but didn’t get) and he may just bail on Michigan… especially if NCAA is kicking him in the b*lls.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.44% for the week ending Nov. 16, according to Freddie Mac's latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey. That's a decrease from theprevious weekwhen it averaged 7.5%. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.61%. The average rate for a 15-year mortgage was 6.76%, down from 6.81% last week and up from 5.98% last year. This downward trend in rates comes after October inflationfigures showed no movement from the previous month, largely thanks to a dip in gas prices, according to the Consumer Price Index(CPI) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Month-to-month, prices remained the same asin September. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.2% in October, down from 3.7% growth last month. Economists had expected prices to increase 0.1% month-over-month and 3.3% year-over-year. Shelter costs, which have been a significant contributor to the overall price increases in the economy, continued its slow deceleration in October, rising 0.3% month over month and 6.7% year over year. ""For the third straight week, mortgage rates trended down, as new data indicates that inflationary pressures are receding,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's Chief Economist. ""The combination of continued economic strength, lower inflation and lower mortgage rates should likely bring more potential homebuyers into the market.""

BUY A HOME IN THESE STATES TO GET STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at arecent International Monetary Fund (IMF) panelthat the progress made on moderating inflation has been gratifying but that there was still a long way to go to achieve its 2% target rate. At its November meeting, the Fed maintained the short-term policy rate within a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. However, all signs point to the Fed being done with raising interest rates, according to Realtor.com Economist Jiayi Xu. October's inflation figures, paired with a slowdown in retail sales and slowing jobs market data, are all signs of a cooling economy and that the Fed's monetary policy is working, Xu said. ""While Chair Powell would not rule out the possibility of another rate hike in December after the November Fed meeting, the Federal Reserve remains committed to being data dependent,"" Xu said in a statement. ""Recent incoming data, such as that from this week, is making a rate hike far less likely. Mortgage rates are likely to continue dropping, as they have in recent weeks."" If you want to take advantage of interest rates before they potentially go up, you could consider shopping for the right mortgage or refinancing your existing one.Visit Credible to speak with a mortgage expertand get your questions answered. MANY AMERICANS PREPARING FOR A RECESSION DESPITE SIGNS THAT SAY OTHERWISE: SURVEY The drop in mortgage rates is positive, but they remain at nearly multi-decade highs, according to Xu. These higher financing rates have pushed buyers to consider larger down payments as they look to hedge higher monthly mortgage loan payments. Down payments rose by 14.7% in the third quarter of 2023 and the median down payment amount was $30,000, according to a Realtor.comreport. The typical down payment as a dollar amount increased in all but 11 states. Washington D.C., followed by Alaska, Montana, Connecticut and Rhode Island, saw the most considerable down payment growth in 2023. Down payments as a share of purchase price fell in 4 states: Idaho, Arizona, Texas and Utah. ""Elevated mortgage rates have raised the cost of financing a typical listed home with a 20% down payment by over $166 (or 7.4%) when compared to last year,"" Xu said. ""To maintain the same monthly payment as one year ago, a buyer would need to increase the down payment to 25.5%, requiring an upfront payment of more than $23,300.""

Argentinians have elected as their next president Javier Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist whose sensational rhetoric has drawn comparisons to former U.S.President Donald Trump. Partial election results showed Milei had 55.8% and Massa 44.2%, with 95% of the votes tallies. Should that margin hold, it would be wider than predicted by all polls and the widest since Argentina's returnto democracy in 1983. Presidential candidate of the Liberty Advances coalition Javier Milei raises his fist after voting in the presidential runoff election in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) On the campaign trail, Milei, with his wild hair and inflammatory rhetoric, pledged economic shock therapy and to slash the size of the state. He’s also indicated he would move the Argentine embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem– paralleling another move by the Trump administration. Milei’s victory comes amid a nationwide wave of deep discontent and rising poverty. His opponent, Economy Minister Sergio Massa of the Peronist party, conceded defeat and congratulated Milei. Argentina's Economy Minister Sergio Massa waves to supporters after conceding defeat to opposition candidate Javier Milei in the presidential runoff election in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.(AP Photo/Gustavo Garello) Argentine has been dealing with crippling inflation – above 140% – and poverty has worsened while Massa Massa's campaign cautioned Argentinians that his libertarian opponent's plan to eliminate key ministries and otherwise sharply curtail the state would threaten public services, including health and education, and welfare programs many rely on. Massa also drew attention to his opponent's often aggressive rhetoric and openly questioned his mental acuity. PINK FLOYD'S ROGER WATERS DENIED HOTEL RESERVATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA AFTER ANTISEMITISM ACCUSATIONS Milei accused Massa and his allies of running a ""campaign of fear"" and he walked back some of his most controversial proposals, such as loosening gun control. In his final campaign ad, Milei looks at the camera and assures voters he has no plans to privatize education or health care. Supporters of presidential candidate Javier Milei gather outside his campaign headquarter after Economy Minister Sergio Massa, candidate of the Peronist party, conceded defeat in the presidential runoff election in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix) Milei's rhetoric resonated widely with Argentines angered by their struggle to make ends meet. The election forced many to decide which of the two they considered to be the least bad choice. Underscoring the bitter division this campaign has brought to the fore, Milei received both jeers and cheers on Friday night at the legendary Colón Theater in Buenos Aires.

311,Fox News,"Media Obama lieutenant brushes off Biden's R-rated insult, says president's age is a problem",Hanna Panreck,"Former Obama adviser David Axelrod spoke on CNN about the backlash he received for suggesting Biden should consider dropping out before the 2024 election. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod doubled down after President Biden reportedlycalled him a ""pr---""and argued that the president has a ""real problem"" if he thinks he can ""cheat nature."" New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd defended Axelrod in a column published on Sunday, criticizing Biden for engaging in ""petty feuds."" ""I don’t care about them thinking I’m a prick — that’s fine,"" Axelrod told Dowd. ""I hope they don’t think the polls are wrong, because they’re not."" Axelrod, who Dowd noted has defended Biden in the past, told Dowd that Biden thinks he can ""cheat nature,"" drawing a comparison to Hillary Clinton. President Biden has reportedly called David Axelrod a ""prick"" in private, according to Politico's Jonathan Martin.(Left: Chris Kleponis/CNP/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Right:  (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)) DAVID AXELROD WARNS BIDEN'S 'AGE ISSUE' IS CONSISTENT CONCERN AMONG VOTERS: 'ONE THING YOU CAN'T REVERSE' ""I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse,"" Axelrod said. ""He thinks he can cheat nature here and it’s really risky. They’ve got a real problem if they’re counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too."" Politico columnist Jonathan Martin wrote in early November that Biden called Axelrod a ""pr---"" in private. ""The president’s flash of anger indicates that he may be in denial, surrounded by enablers who are sugarcoating a grim political forecast,"" Dowd wrote. Dowd said the president shouldn't have a ""chip on his shoulder,"" and noted Axelrod received a ton of messages from others who agreed with his assessment of the latest polling.

He needs to gather the sharpest minds in his party and hear what they have to say, not engage in petty feuds,"" Dowd wrote. Axelrod urged the president to consider whether it might be ""wise"" to drop out of the race following a poll that showed Biden trailing Donald Trump in several key battleground states. Axelrod reacted to Martin's reporting during an appearance on CNN. ""Listen, I understand he was irritated because I raised concerns that many, many Democrats had. And again, you know, my feeling is either get out or get going.

All rights reserved.FAQ-New Privacy Policy Ken Rusk, 'Blue Collar Cash' author and former construction worker, discusses survey data indicating employers value blue collar workers' experience and skills more than a college education. Employers don't value college degrees as much as originally thought,recent survey datashows, and the disdain is behind a restored appreciation for blue-collar job-seekers that bring skill and experience over education. The study,known as the Freedom Economy Index (FEI), a joint project of job recruiting service Red Balloon and Public Square, surveyed opinions from 70,000 small businesses between Oct. 25 and Oct. 30, with 905 respondents, a 3% margin of error and a 95% confidence level. When asked about the ""return on investment"" of higher education, a whopping 67% of participating employers responded ""strongly no"" when asked if they believed institutions of higher education were ""graduating students with relevant skills that today's business community needs."" JOB EXPERT PUSHES BACK ON CULTURAL ‘STIGMA’ HAVING A ‘DISTURBING’ IMPACT ON SKILLED WORK, GENERATIONAL HANDOFF An additional 24.4% responded with ""somewhat no"" while the remaining 8.7% responded either ""somewhat yes,"" ""strongly yes,"" or ""other."" ""This doesn't surprise me at all,"" former construction worker and ""Blue Collar Cash"" author Ken Rusk said Sunday on ""FOX & Friends Weekend."" College graduates, once favored in the job market, are now seemingly less valuable than their blue-collar counterparts.(i Stock / i Stock) ""Colleges used to be a place where you would get a degree, and that would only enhance an effective human being, an already effective human being. Now we're seeing colleges attach these degrees to people that literally can't come out and do some of the life skills that we need."" Some who participated in the survey echoed that sentiment. ""The talent shortage will just get worse because high schools and colleges produce no talent,"" one employer said. SKILLED TRADE WORKERS NEEDED TO HELP ‘GET A LOT MORE DONE’: JOHN CATANEO Survey data showed employers prefer skilled workers over those with a college education and no experience.(i Stock / i Stock) Another called for skills to be taught in high school, while a third responded to the survey question with ""Absolutely not,"" calling advanced education a ""waste"" from the perspective of a former college graduate. Rusk said job-seekers with college degrees pose a challenge in another way. ""They've [graduates] kind of been hoodwinked a little bit to think that the degree is the thing that's going to carry the day completely,"" he said. ""You have to remember that it's something that you're supposed to use to enhance the skills that you already have, and that's what we're seeing now. They're relying way too much on that piece of paper or that degree, rather than getting some of the experiences that they need [and] that these companies really want."" The survey also asked employers if they are more or less likely to consider a job-seeker with a four-year degree. AS GEN Z OPTS OUT OF BLUE-COLLAR WORK IN AMERICA, EXPERT SHARES BENEFITS OF LEARNING A TRADE Technical companies are having a hard time replacing older trade workers who are retiring. There haven't been enough young people training to fill open roles. Only 10% of participants said a college degree would make a potential job-seeker more hirable. On the other hand, 41.5% said the degree makes ""no difference,"" while over 40% said a college degree would make them less likely to hire a prospective applicant. ""Let's use this to apply the law of supply and demand in our favor here, where supply is low and demand is high. That's where the money goes,"" Rusk said, stressing the importance oflearning a tradein today's labor market. ""You can get a degree, or you can get a certificate in a lot of these trades for a tenth or a fifth of what you're paying for college.

315,Fox News,FIRST ON FOXU.S.Homeowner who defended family in driveway shoot-out stripped of gun permit,Emma Colton,"A Los Angeles homeowner who used a firearm to fend off apparent would-be robbers at his home talks to the NRA in a video exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital. FIRST ON FOX:ALos Angeles homeownerwho used a firearm to fend off apparent would-be robbers at his home said his concealed carry permit was taken away just days after the residential-neighborhood shoot-out. ""After successfully defending my home and my family and my 5-month-old child, California has now decided to suspend my Second Amendment [rights],"" L.A. resident and married father of one Vince Ricci said in a video for the NRA that was exclusively shared with Fox News Digital. Ricci told Fox News Digital that the sheriff's office called him Thursday morning to inform him his concealed carry permit was ""revoked,"" and he said it was due to him ""yelling"" at Los Angeles police officers when they visited his home to investigate the shooting three days after the incident. Ricci previously railed that the LAPD – the department investigating the case – carried out ""sloppy police"" work, including allegedly not picking up the casings scattered near his home as evidence. ""We recognize that this incident was extremely traumatic and startling for the Ricci family and we hope the individuals responsible for this crime are arrested and held accountable,"" the sheriff's office told Fox News Digital on Saturday evening. ARMED HOMEOWNER WHO DEFENDED HOME IN SHOOT-OUT UNLOADS ON LIBERAL POLITICIANS: 'NOT GONNA CARE' Vince Ricci is shown at a shooting range.(NRA ) The sheriff's office told Fox News Digital Saturday evening that the Department of Justice establishes guidelines for CCW permits and that the sheriff's office follows the parameters established by the agency. ""The CCW permit may be immediately reinstated as long as the permit holder has also followed all required CCW policies (i.e. proper notifications, use of properly documented weapon, etc.),"" the sheriff's office said. ""The DOJ has been notified and there are avenues for Mr. Ricci to re-apply for his permit. We have been in contact with the Ricci family and have been providing information to them about CCW protocols and guidelines in an effort to ensure their Second Amendment rights are protected."" The sheriff's office stressed that it ""respects the rights of individuals to exercise their Second Amendment rights"" and processes thousands of CCW permits and renewals each year. A gunfight broke out on Ricci’s front door on Nov. 4 just after the homeowner returned to his gated Los Angeles house after hitting the gym. Two armed men jumped his fence and tried to force their way in the house as Ricci was about to unlock his front door. Ricci’s wife, 5-month-old daughter and the family’s nanny were inside. Obtaining a concealed carry permit in Californiahas historically been difficult compared to other states, with Ricci previously telling Fox News Digital it took months for his permit to process. Ricci, however, used his firearm on his private property. California law allows legal U.S. residents over the age of 18 to carry firearms on private property and residences without a permit or license. Ricci said in the NRA videothat the shooting is a clear self-defense case, noting he was confronted by two men ""pointing guns at my chest"" as he tried to make his way into the home. A suspect first approaches the L.A. homeowner while pointing a gun.(LAPD) ""My situation is unique because it happened at my front door, all on camera. But this happens time and time again all over the country … People sweep it under the rug because it doesn't behoove their political agenda. The fact is, evil will always exist,"" he said. ARMED WOMAN TURNS TABLES, FATALLY SHOOTS DAUGHTER'S EX-BOYFRIEND WHO HELD HUSBAND AT GUNPOINT: POLICE The L.A. homeowner fires his gun at two suspects who were shooting at him on his property.(LAPD) In an interview with Fox News Digital last week, Ricci said that this wasn’t the first time he’s been targeted by criminals. His home was broken into in June, and his car was broken into just months before that. He said agroup of criminalswere targeting other homes in his neighborhood, that they were driving a Dodge Charger with no license plate and had broken into his neighbor’s house the night prior to the shoot-out. The LAPD previously provided Fox News Digital with the department's press release on the attempted robbery and said detectives are investigating and calling on members to come forward with any tips on the case. The NRA told Fox News Digital the organization is ""proud to have Vince as a fellow NRA member"" and called the revocation of his CCW ""reprehensible."" ""His decisive actions to protect his wife and daughter embody the core principles that NRA members fight for every day,"" NRA spokesperson Billy Mc Laughlin said in a statement. ""It's reprehensible that California is shredding his Second Amendment rightsafter he defended his family. Governor [Gavin] Newsom and [Los Angeles County District Attorney George] Gascon's pro-criminal policies have transformed Los Angeles and the wider state into what resembles a war zone.

316,Fox News,Politics Older Americans are losing billions of dollars as dangerous new scam emerges,Jamie Joseph,"AI expert Marva Bailer tells Fox News Digital how the open availability of artificial intelligence can have negative impacts and talks potential federal legislation to control it. Older Americans reportedly lost $1.1 billion to fraud in 2022, according to the annual Senate Committee on Aging report released this month, and most of the scams utilized AI technologyto clone the voices of people they knew and other AI-generated ploys. During a Thursday committee hearing on AI scams, committee chairman Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., published the group’s annual fraud book highlighting the top scams last year. It found that from January 2020 to June 2021, the FBI found ""individuals reportedly lost $13 million to grandparent and person-in-need scams."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, also a member of the committee, said the $1.1 billion figure in total losses is ""almost surely an underestimate,"" since it does not factor in the instances of victims who don't report scams due to embarrassment. Casey said in a statement that ""federal action"" is needed to put up guardrails to protect consumers from AI-generated scams. There are currently very little regulations on AI capacities, which witnessesurged lawmakersto crack down on through legislation. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The Open AI logo is seen on a mobile phone in front of a computer screen displaying output from Chat GPT.(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) ""Any consumer, no matter their age, gender, or background, can fall victim to these ultra-convincing scams, and the stories we heard today from individuals across the country are heartbreaking,"" he said. ""As a parent and grandparent, I relate to the fear and concern these victims must feel."" The top 10 categories of scams reported in the fraud book were financial impersonation and fraud, robocalls, computer scams, catfishing on dating profiles, identity theft and others. The most prominent scams used AI technology to mimic people’s voices who then make calls to the victims, family members or loved ones, asking for money. Several testimonies from witnesses in the hearing said they received calls that sounded exactly like their loved one was in danger, was injured or was being held hostage. Tahir Ekin, Ph D, director of the Texas State Center for Analytics and Data Science, who was present at the hearing, testified this deliberate strategy of impersonation catapults ""their believability and emotional appeal."" US MILITARY NEEDS AI VEHICLES, WEAPON SYSTEMS TO BE 'SUPERIOR' GLOBAL FORCE: EXPERTS ""Prioritizing the enhancement of data and AI literacy among older Americans, and actively involving them in prevention and detection efforts, stands as a cornerstone,"" he said. One older couple, featured in a video testimony in the hearing, received a call from who they thought was their daughter. She sounded distressed and asked for help. ""My daughter was, she was crying on the phone, profusely crying and saying, ‘mom, mom, mom,’ and of course my wife was saying, ‘Le Ann, Le Ann, what is the matter?’, and she repeated it again, ‘mom, mom, mom’ and it sounded exactly like her,"" Terry Holtzapple, one of the victims, said. Gary Schildhorn, a Philadelphia-based attorney and another targeted victim of an AI voice clone scam, also testified at the hearing. He almost sent $9,000 to the scammer until he confirmed with his daughter-in-law it was an extortion attempt. The scammer, posing as an attorney, called Schildhorn requesting funds to bail his son out of jail for causing a car accident and failing a breathalyzer test.

""I sat motionless in my car just trying to process these events. How did they get my son’s voice? The only conclusion I can come up with is that they used artificial intelligence, or AI, to clone his voice… it is manifestly apparent that this technology… provide[s] a riskless avenue for fraudsters to prey on us."" Since no money was sent, however, law enforcement told Schildhorn that no crime had been committed and no further action was taken. ""With crypto and AI, law enforcement does not have a remedy,"" Schildhorn said during the hearing. ""There needs to be some legislation to allow these people to be identified… so that there’s a remedy for the harm that’s being caused. Currently, there’s no remedy,"" he said. According to the Federal Trade Commission, elderly Americans are more likely to fall prey to online scams than younger people. Jamie Joseph is a writer who covers politics.

317,Fox News,Media One of the world's most prominent Indigenous icons may not be Indigenous after all,Kendall Tietz,"In a tweet on Super Tuesday, Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard referred to rival Elizabeth Warren as a 'fake Indigenous woman of color.' One of Canada’s most prominent Indigenous icons might not be Indigenous after all, according tomedia reports. Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was considered the first Indigenous person to win an Oscar, has always claimed to be a Cree Indian born in Canada who was then adopted by an American couple and raised near Boston. The singer-songwriter is known for her appearance on Sesame Street, was commemorated on Canadian postage stamps and performed for Queen Elizabeth II. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) News conducted an investigation into Sainte-Marie based on public records and interviews, including with estranged family members of the singer-songwriter. The 82-year-old icon has said she was born on the Piapot First Nation in Saskatchewan and adoptedas an infant by a White family in Massachusetts, but a birth certificate says she was born Beverly Jean Santamaria to parents of Italian and English ancestry in the U.S. The investigation documented contradictory statements that Sainte-Marie has made about her Indigenous past, including articles from early in her career in which she was described as being from different native groups. Singer Buffy Sainte-Marie performs onstage during Hardly Strictly Bluegrass at Golden Gate Park on October 2, 2016 in San Francisco, California.(Getty Images) ELIZABETH WARREN MOCKED FOR ‘INDIGENOUS PEOPLE’S DAY' TWEET: ‘YOU JUST MIGHT WANT TO SIT THIS ONE OUT’ But, Heidi St. Marie, the daughter of Sainte-Marie’s older brother, told CBC that the family didn't believe Sainte-Marie was Indigenous. ""She wasn’t born in Canada.… She’s clearly born in the United States,"" St. Marie said. ""She’s clearly not Indigenous or Native American."" ""Nobody except for Buffy ever talked about Buffy being adopted,"" she said. CBC said her claim is supported by documents obtained by the news organization, including Sainte-Marie’s birth certificate which says she was born a White female in Stoneham, Massachusetts, to Albert and Winifred Santamaria in 1941. In defense of her heritage, Sainte-Marie posted avideo statementto Facebook, where she said she is ""a proud member of the Native community with deep roots in Canada."" Musician Buffy Sainte-Marie interviewed for her appearance on the BBC television series 'The Old Grey Whistle Test', October 1971.(Getty Images) In 2022, PBS reported that ""she was taken from her family against their will"" as a part of a practice in Canada known as the Sixties Scoop. ""In Canada, we had something that, sometimes, a little bit later referred to as the ‘Big Scoop’ where Native children were removed from the home,"" Sainte-Marie said in a 2018 interview with NPR. ""They’re assigned a birthday. They’re assigned kind of a biography. So, in many cases, adoptive people don’t really know what the true story is."" NATIVE AMERICAN GROUP PROTESTS CHIEFS' NAMESAKE ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY Sainte-Marie’s younger sister, Lainey, told CBC her parents never mentioned that Sainte-Marie was adopted, adding that the first time she heard such a claim was when Sainte-Marie was in her early 20s. CBC traveled to Stoneham to confirm the authenticity of the birth certificate.

""This is the original that came from the hospital,"" Sagarino said. ""There’s no refuting this because it’s in my custody from my files in my vault."" ""I can say absolutely with 100 percent certainty that this is the original birth certificate,"" Sagarino added told CBC.

321,Fox News,"World Arab countries slam doors on Palestinian refugees, and expert explains why",Ruth Marks Eglash,"Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of a Hamas founding leader, joined 'FOX & Friends' to discuss why it is necessary for the U.S. to pressure Egypt to open the border crossing and the latest on the Israel-Hamas war. JERUSALEM — At a summit of leaders from more than 50 Arab and Muslim states held last weekend in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Israel’s military response in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacrewas fiercely condemned. But what was missing from the gathering’s final statement was any immediate solution for the 2.3 million civilians of the Palestinian enclave, more than half of whom are now internally displaced after nearly six weeks of fighting. While the final resolution called for an immediate end to ""the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza"" and made offers of humanitarian and financial aid to the Palestinians, not one country came forward with a viable solution, even temporarily, for the 1.5 million civilians who, according to the latest U.N. figures, are now internally displaced in the southern section of the Strip. As the death toll in Gaza rises, thousands of civilians continue to flee the conflict and head southward, where the Israeli military has said it is safer and where truckloads of food, water, and medicine arrive daily via the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. The U.N. estimates 250,000 fled in the past week alone. 400 AMERICANS APPROVED TO LEAVE GAZA AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR RAGES Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, fifth from right, poses for a family photo during the Extraordinary Joint Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League at King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 11, 2023.(Mustafa Kamaci/Anadolu via Getty Images) Some have questioned why nearby Arab countries, who have provided temporary shelter in the past to civilians from other regional conflicts, appear unwilling to even discuss sheltering the refugees from Gaza. ""Arab states have historically been divided with regard to their stance on the Palestinian people and numerous other significant issues,"" Ahed Al-Hindi, a senior fellow at the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital. ""Although these states project solidarity with the Palestinian people, they hold divergent views on the most effective course of action."" ""Certain countries, including those in the Arab Gulf, Jordan, Morocco and Egypt advocate for a two-state solution, which they believe can be accomplished through diplomacy. Conversely, the Iranian axis espouses the ideology of obliterating Israel and establishing a Palestinian state extending from the river to the sea."" Al-Hindi said the primary reason why even the moderate states, most of which have diplomatic ties with Israel, have not taken practical steps to help the civilian population in Gaza is due totheir aversion to Hamas and its goals."" ""As a result, many Arab countries are concerned that aiding the Gazans could inadvertently benefit Hamas, given that the organization has ruled in Gaza for nearly a generation,"" he said. ""Hamas is a network affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Muslim Brotherhood opposes every Arab monarch. This poses significant internal risks to the aforementioned states."" Palestinians wait to cross into Egypt at Rafah, Gaza Strip, Nov. 1, 2023.(AP Photo/Fatima Shbair) GAZA RESIDENTS SPEAK OF HAMAS’ BRUTALITY AMID DESIRES FOR PEACE IN THE REGION ""Ideologies of the Muslim Brotherhood advocate for the overthrow of Arab monarchies and the formation of a Sunni revolutionary Islamic republic, which would resemble Iran but operate under the banner of Sunni jihadism,"" Al-Hindi added. ""Since Hamas serves as an agent for Iran, which in turn presents an additional danger to Arab monarchs, the majority of these nations are worried that their assistance to Gaza may fall into the clutches of Hamas."" The two Arab countries bordering Israel on either side — Egypt and Jordan — have both pointedly refused to offer refuge to any number of Palestinians from Gaza, even though Jordan already has a large Palestinian population and Egypt’s expansive and sparsely populated Sinai Peninsula is just a few miles from where the thousands of Palestinians are now being cared for by international aid agencies. Earlier this month, Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly dismissed calls for displaced Palestinians to resettle in the Sinai desert, saying his country would protect its land and sovereignty at any cost. His comments came following the revelation of an Israeli intelligence document proposing that residents of the Strip be evacuated to tent cities in Sinai as the Israeli military works to destroy Hamas. An aerial picture taken from a commercial airplane shows a view of Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula.(Ahmad Gharabli/AFP via Getty Images) ""We are ready to sacrifice millions of lives to protect our territory from any encroachment,"" Madbouly said in a recent speech, advocating that a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians was the only comprehensive resolution that would guarantee regional peace. Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that such a solution should have been touted by the international community at the onset of the war. ""Washington should have made the humanitarian argument, helped fund a camp for Gaza refugees in Sinai and guaranteed their return after the end of the war,"" he said. ""This would have convinced Egyptians to take them."" Tents set up for Palestinians seeking refuge along the Gaza Strip Oct. 20, 2023.(Ahmad Hasaballah/Getty Images) Still, said Abdul-Hussain, both Jordan and Egypt also have their own domestic concerns driving their refusal to offer refuge to Palestinians now displaceddue to the fighting. ""Jordan is not an option,"" he said, adding that it does not border Gaza, and logistically it is not feasible to move hundreds of thousands of Gazans there. Egypt’s resistance, Abdul-Hussain said, stems from President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi's view of Hamas, a Palestinian off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the Egyptian leader has been fighting since he came to power. 300 MILES OF HAMAS SUBTERRANEAN TERROR TUNNELS THE NEXT BIG CHALLENGE FOR IDF: 'GAZA METRO' A man walks in front of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency building as UNRWA personnel strike, demanding a salary increase because of the high cost of living in Gaza City, Gaza, Jan. 30, 2023.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) ""Transplanting Gazans, with thousands of possible Hamas cadres or partisans, into his Sinai, where he battled ISIS, might scare the Egyptians a bit,"" he explained. Hussain also pointed out that even if Egypt did want to take in the Gazan refugees, the country’s financial instability made it impossible. While the practical arguments presented by these two Arab countries are plausible, there is also a deeper, ideological and even emotional reason rooted in the region’s history, mostly dating back to Israel’s creation in 1948. In fact, many of theimages coming out of Gazain recent days, with columns of shabbily dressed and clearly shaken civilians trekking miles on foot to reach safety in the south, have been compared to what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe,"" when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians chose to leave their homes or were forced to flee to neighboring countries during Israel’s war for independence. ""The Arab world, particularly countries like Egypt and Jordan, have found themselves in a very uncomfortable situation,"" said Michael Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst and head of intelligence at Leo Beck International. ""They need to show support for Palestinians in Gaza because a large majority of the Arab public sympathizes with the Palestinian cause. But there is not much they can do beyond token statements of support and limited aid."" Horowitz said thenotion of Egypt or Jordanhosting Palestinian refugees was a ""non-starter."" ""Doing so would actually anger the pro-Palestinian segments of their population, who would feel that they are actively facilitating a ""second Nakba,"" he said, adding that such a move would be so unpopular among the public it could even destabilize some of those countries.

Hilterman also noted that the Palestinians ""do not want to leave Palestine and become refugees again, and both Egypt and the Palestinian population of Gaza fear that the temporary will become permanent, especially if Israel renders Gaza uninhabitable, which it is well on its way in doing.""

For most people, getting the flu means a few days of sickness and then a return to regular life. But for Kristin Fox, a 42-year-old mother and high-school principalin Ohio, the virus led to the loss of her arms and legs — and the start of a long, challenging journey to a new normal. Fox’s ordeal began in March 2020, just a few days beforethe COVID-19 pandemicshut down the world. She came down with a sore throat on Friday, and by Sunday she felt considerably worse. At urgent care that night, shetested positive for the flu. Fox had just gotten the flu vaccine in November. AFTER LOSING HER LEG TO THE FLU, VIRGINIA WOMAN URGES PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED: ‘DON’T WASTE TIME’ The physician’s assistant gave her Tamiflu and sent her home. The next day, Fox couldn’t get off the couch. ""I felt like I was dying,"" she told Fox News Digital during a phone interview.

Fox's friend drove her to a small nearby hospital. ""Within 30 minutes, I was on a ventilator, and they said I probably wouldn't make it,"" Fox said. She had developed bacterial pneumonia, which was leading to organ failure. Fox’s kidneys were shutting down and one of her lungs had collapsed. What themedical teamapparently didn’t realize, Fox said, was that she was already in septic shock, which is a life-threatening infection that causes organ failure and plummeting blood pressure. GETTING SEPSIS IN THE HOSPITAL IS A RED FLAG FOR FUTURE HEART ATTACKS, STUDY FINDS By Tuesday night, the hospital brought in a priest, expecting that Fox wouldn’t make it through the night — ""but bythe grace of God, I did,"" she said. By Thursday, doctors realized Fox was septic, she said. She was put into a medically induced coma and given vasopressor drugs in an attempt to save her vital organs. Fox is pictured with her son, Landon, and her daughter, Laiken.(Kristin Fox) ""The doctors told my family they should prepare for the loss of some fingers or toes, because they were pulling so much from my extremities to try to keep my organs alive,"" Fox said. A couple of days later, the world shut down due to the pandemic — but because Fox was deemed the most critical patient in the hospital, they allowed her parents and husband to stay with her. ""It was touch and go for the next week,"" Fox said. Each year, at least 1.7 million adults in the U.S. develop sepsis, and nearly 270,000 die from the infection. On March 26, the doctors told Fox’shusband and parentsthat they would have to amputate her legs the following day. Fox’s mother begged the doctors to wait a few more days to see if she got better — but they said if they held off any longer, the infection would continue to rise above Fox’s knees, making her quality of life substantially worse, Fox related. TEXAS MOM SUFFERS QUADRUPLE AMPUTATION, CREDITS HER FAITH AND A LITTLE DOG FOR PULLING HER THROUGH The next day, Fox’s legs were amputated below her knees. In the days after that first surgery, Fox’s arms got excessively worse, she said — ""but they waited and didn't take my arms until April 6, almost two weeks later."" Fox considers it ""lucky"" that her arms were amputated just below the elbow, so she still has that range of motion — although it’s still very short compared to amputees who only lose their hands. Within 72 hours, Fox was able to breathe without a ventilator and was transferred out of the ICU and into a ""step-up room."" After the surgeries, Fox was slowly brought out of her coma. ""I was so confused,"" she said. ""I was still on a ventilator. I had no idea what was going on in the world (with COVID)."" Even so, within 72 hours, Fox was able to breathe without a ventilator and was transferred out of the ICU and into a ""step-up room."" A few weeks later, on May 17, she left the hospital. COLD AND FLU SEASON IS COMING: KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS NOW ""They literally wrapped me like a mummy because I didn't want my kids to see — I hadn’t told them yet about losing my arms and legs,"" she recalled. Fox (second from left) is pictured with her lifelong best friends.(Kristin Fox) Eventually, Fox told her son and daughter — who were 9 and 6 at the time — what had happened. ""Between that and COVID, it was so much for little kids to wrap their minds around."" The next stop was the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Rehabilitation Institute to start physical therapy. ""I knew it was the best place to go,"" Fox said. ""I had to go somewhere that was going to really kick my butt in therapy."" COVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY In Pittsburgh, Fox completed six weeks of intense physical therapy, three hours per day. Along the way, there were some setbacks — back at home, herlung collapsedagain, and doctors had to put in a chest tube. Then she returned to Pittsburgh for six more weeks of therapy. In October 2020, seven months after her ordeal began, Fox received prosthetics for her arms and legs, marking the beginning of a brand new journey. ""It was a huge learning curve,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It was like trial and error of what worked and what didn't."" Last fall, Fox connected with an organization called 50 Legs in Orlando, Florida, which selects amputees who will receive custom prosthetics tailored to each patient’s body. After applying, Fox was selected and made the trip to get fitted for new, custom-made prosthetics — for free. Fox is pictured with her family at her first annual softball tournament, which helped to raise funds for her care.(Kristin Fox) ""It has been life-changing, because the prosthetics are truly built for me and not just a size that everybody wears,"" she said. ""Anytime I need something, they ship it to me, or they put me on a plane to come down for a quick fix."" She added, ""They're just the most incredible people I have ever encountered."" These days, Fox uses only the prosthetic legs. ""I don’t use the arms at all,"" she said. ""I’ve learned to live without them — it’s easier. I even drive without them."" As a quadruple amputee, Fox faces new challenges in navigating the world,everything from working outto going to football games. ""There are just different things I never thought about before, in terms of accessibility and compliance,"" she said. ""The people who make the legislation don't sit in the seat very often."" Fox is pictured with her husband and children. She said her family motivated her to keep moving forward.(Kristin Fox) After a year away from work, Fox was ready to return to her job as assistant principal at Campbell High School. ""I mentally had to go back to work,"" she said. ""I’m a very ‘go, go, go’ type of person. And if I went out on disability, I was not going to have a good quality of life."" Fox said her children andher students at schoolalso motivated her to keep moving forward. FLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A 'DAY-TO-DAY’ HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEY ""I had a lot of young eyes watching me, and I knew there were so many kids who would learn so much from my reaction to this,"" she said. ""It’s taught them about respecting differences and treating everyone fairly, regardless of their ability,"" Fox noted. ""And it’s taught them how they should overcome their own barriers and tough moments."" One of Fox’s favorite mantras, she said, is ""I've never had a tough day — I have tough moments."" She noted, ""As an educator, I didn't want my students to think I took the easy way out."" ""Sometimes I catch myself complaining, but then I remind myself that my kids could have been mourning my death."" Back at work, Fox said her school has ""moved mountains"" to make the transition as easy as possible for her. Fox’s co-principal, Brad Yeager, shared with Fox News Digital how impressed he's been by her triumph over adversity. ""No matter what obstacles she has faced, she has always stayed the course as not only an educational leader, butas a mother,"" he said. ""She has taken this challenge head-on and has never let it come between her and her students,"" Yeager went on. ""She exemplifies perseverance … Our students look up to her and realize that no matter how tough their situation is, that is not an excuse to not give it their all each and every day."" Fox’s lifelong best friend, Lisa Saxon, and her sister, Lauren Baco, are among her biggest champions. ""Not many people can say their best friendis a real-life hero, but I can — and Kristin continues to defy the odds every day,"" Saxon told Fox News Digital. Fox's prosthetics company made her a customized mold for her toothbrush to go onto the residual limb of her arm.(Kristin Fox) ""Coming out of this as a quadruple amputee was life-changing, but it has only made her and everyone around her stronger."" Baco cited a quote that reflects what her sister has gone through: ""You never know how strong you are until being strong is all you have left."" Her sister added, ""Kristin has shown every day how strong and resilient she is, taking on the day as if she has no limits or barriers."" DOCTORS URGE VACCINATIONS AHEAD OF THIS YEAR'S FLU SEASON, WHICH COULD BE 'FAIRLY BAD,' EXPERTS SAY The Youngstown community has rallied around Fox, organizing multiple fundraisers to help with her very steep medical expenses. Although insurance has covered some of her care, the out-of-pocket costs have been high — and there have also been expensive renovations to make the family’s home more accessible. ""Youngstown is not rich, but when something like this happens to somebody, they find ways to help,"" she said. ""That's part of small-town pride."" Fox is pictured with her family at her surprise 40th birthday party, one year and one month after the day she first got sick.(Kristin Fox) ""People send me stuff and stop me in the store and say, ‘I pray for you all the time,’"" she added. ""Those are the people who got us through."" Overall, Fox said her ordeal has wholly shifted her perspective. ""Sometimes I catch myself complaining, but then I remind myself that my kids could have been mourning my death,"" she said. ""They're 12 and 10 now, and I can't imagine them living without me."" Each year, at least 1.7 million adults in the U.S. develop sepsis, and nearly 270,000 die from the infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Centerand a Fox News medical contributor, called the flu ""a great enabler"" of more severe illness. ""A bacterial secondary infection is very common, upwards of 20% to 30%,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""This can be anything from a sinus infection to bronchitis, meningitis or pneumonia."" Kristin Fox is pictured with her daughter, Laiken.(Kristin Fox) The flu can cause an inflammatory response called a cytokine storm, the doctor noted, which interferes with the body's ability to fight off a subsequent bacterial infection. ""If bacterial pneumonia goes undiagnosed for awhile, sepsis can occur, as the bacteria spreads to the bloodstream,"" Siegel warned. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER ""If blood pressure drops too low, blood flow to the extremities drops off and tissue can die, leading to the need for amputation."" Although the secondary bacterial infection is common, it is ""very uncommon"" for it to lead to sepsis, Siegel said. Warning signs of sepsis include high fever, fatigue, dizziness and weakness. To help prevent limb loss, Siegel said it’s important to get the patient to the hospital quickly and to startbroad-spectrum antibiotics. Fox is pictured on the day she gave the commencement address at her alma mater, Youngstown State University, in May 2021.(Kristin Fox) ""When the source of the infection is confirmed, use vasopressors to clamp down on arteries to preserve blood flow to vital organs and increase blood pressure,"" he recommended. Doctors should also monitor the extremities and levels of serum lactate, which measures the amount of lactic acid in the blood. These levels can go up if the body’s tissues are not getting enough oxygen, Siegel said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox said she hopes her story can help people — not only patients, but also themedical community— to be more aware of the signs of sepsis. ""I can’t go back and change [things],"" she said. ""I can only hope to be an advocate for the future."" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health.

French President Emmanuel Macron’swife Brigitte Macron revealed her relationship anxieties from the early days of dating the future French leader – including concerns he would ""fall in love with someone his age"" after moving schools. ""My head was in a mess,"" Brigitte Macron said during a rare interview, given to the outlet Paris Match, and reported in the Daily Telegraph. ""For me, such a young boy was crippling."" ""Emmanuel had to leave for Paris,"" Macron revealed. ""I told myself that he would fall in love with someone his [own] age. It didn’t happen."" The couple’s age difference– she, 70, and he, 45 – has remained a hot topic for the couple: Macron addressed the difference during an interview in 2017 with Elle France, telling the outlet ""there are times in your life where you need to make vital choices.""

The newest interview, translated and reported by the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph, reveals that Macron suffered significant anxiety over the age difference, which eventually caused a scandal when it came to light that she, a then-40-year-old teacher had engaged in a relationship with her 15-year-old pupil, Emmanuel.

Booths, an upscalegrocery storechain that has most of its 28 locations in northern England, is moving against the self-checkout trend. The two largest grocery chains in the U.K., Tesco and Sainsbury’s, have installed thousands of self-checkouts while reducing the number of staffed checkouts. Booths managing director Nigel Murray told the BBC, ""We like to talk to people and we’re really proud that we’re moving largely to a place where our customers are served by people, by human beings, so rather than artificial intelligence, we’re going for actual intelligence."" SELF-CHECKOUT MACHINES NOW ASK FOR TIPS IN LATEST SQUEEZE ON CUSTOMERS British grocery store chain Booths is removing nearly all of its self-checkout kiosks in a push to improve customer service.(Julia Gomina via i Stock  / i Stock) Murray told the outlet that customers found Booths self-scan machines to be slow and unreliable as well as impersonal. ""We’re not great fans of self-checkouts,"" Murray added in comments to The Grocer, a trade publication based in the U.K. ""We pride ourselves on great customer service and you can’t do that through a robot.""

326,Fox News,Media Professor tries to downplay impact of shoplifting despite retailers losing $110B to theft,Lindsay Kornick,"FOX Business anchor Cheryl Casone on how crime is affecting major retailers and Americans having less cash than before the coronavirus pandemic Shoplifting has had an ""outsized impact"" ondiscussions about crimethat has been exploited by justice reform opponents, one professor argued on Friday. Brooklyn College sociology professor Alex Vitale was one of multiple professors and researchers whodiscussed with CNNgrowing concerns over the rise in retail theft as more stores have closed or moved out of large cities. However, Vitale insisted that the concern is usually overblown. ""Historically, shoplifting has always had this outsized impact on public discourse,"" Vitale said. He added, ""We see examples on video of behaving badly and it gets invested with all this extra meaning about the collapse of social order."" Shoplifters in Washington D.C. were caught on video stealing laundry detergent in the middle of the day.(Fox News) ORGANIZED SHOPLIFTING IS A $100-BILLION PROBLEM. HERE'S WHY WE'RE ALL SCREWED The report by CNN contextualized ""anxiety over shoplifting"" as ""an enduring phenomenon"" that ""is often a stand-in for larger concerns of cultural, economic or political changes"" from concerns over ""bored and sexually repressed"" women in the 1800’s to teens and college students in the 1960s. ""In the 1960s, there was more of a political and cultural element to shoplifting,"" Michael Flamm, a historian from Ohio Wesleyan, said. ""There was a much wider articulation that shoplifting was a critique of the capitalist system."" Flamm added, ""Shoplifting tied into a wider sense that respect for authority was diminishing. It was a stand-in for larger concerns and anxieties."" The National Retail Federation (NRF)found that retails across the nation lost $112.1 billion in revenue due to theft in 2022 with Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City being among the most affected cities. In addition, major store brands such as Target and Walmart have shuttered multiple stores, citing retail crime and annual losses as a factor. A viral video showed freezers at a San Francisco Walgreens chained shut after workers complained of rampant theft.(Richie Greenberg @greenbergnation) Although the article also found that shoplifting reports in 24 major cities were 16% higher in the first half of 2023 compared to 2019, it cited a report from the Council on Criminal Justice that ""there is no clear national rise in shoplifting."" TARGET SHUTTERS STORES, CONSUMERS AFFECTED AS MAJOR COMPANIES GRAPPLE WITH MASSIVE THEFT LOSSES The piece further added that the shoplifting issue has been used politically to push back against police and criminal justice reforms. ""Shoplifting has also become a politically charged crime that many on the right and some Democrats have exploited to oppose criminal justice policy reforms,"" the article stated. James Walsh, who directs the University of Ontario Institute of Technology’s graduate program on criminology and justice, added, ""The figure of a shoplifter may provide for a scapegoat for deeper problems that are more complex and intractable… It resonates with broader concerns about law and disorder."" Walgreens announced plans to close five of its San Francisco stores due to organized retail shoplifting that has plagued its stores in the city.

A self-proclaimed ""manny"" who served as a male nanny for families in Southern Californiawill spend the rest of his life behind bars for sexually assaulting 16 boys in his care, according to a release from the district attorney’s office. Matthew Antonio Zakrzewski, 34, of Costa Mesa, was sentenced Friday to 705 years to life plus two years and eight months for thesexual assaultsand showing pornography to another young boy he intended to sexually assault. Zakrzewski filmed many of these sexual assaults, the district attorney’s office said. The boys’ ages ranged between two and 12 years old.The crimeswere committed between 2014 and 2019. Matthew Antonio Zakrzewski, 34, was convicted of 34 felonies for molesting 16 young boys, often filming the encounters, and showing pornography to a 17th. He is scheduled to be sentenced on November 17 and could face life in prison.(Orange County District Attorney's Office) Laguna Beach police arrested Zakrzewski on May 17, 2019, at a local airport after he deplaned an international flight. After criminal charges were filed, authorities appealed to the public for help in locating other potential victims. Video evidence and tips from the public helped investigators identify additional victims and file additional charges against Zakrzewski. SEX-CRAZED PRISON GUARDS HELD JACUZZI ORGIES; 1 REFUSED TO WORK BEFORE INTERCOURSE: REPORT Zakrzewski had dubbed himself ""the original Sitter Buddy"" on the namesake website he helped create. The website offered to connect parents in Orange County with prospective caregivers. Zakrzewski characterized himself as a ""manny"" who offered mentorships, big brother relationships and overnight and vacation babysitting.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Before the Los Angeles Chargersfell to the Green Bay Packers on the road, it appeared they lost one of their core defensive players in Joey Bosa. Bosa left Sunday’s 23-20 loss tothe Packerson a medical cart, and his reaction said it all. Bosa was clearly upset as he covered his face with a towel and looked to be crying. The Chargers announced that Bosa would not return with a foot injury, though the exact injury wasn’t disclosed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Joey Bosa of the Los Angeles Chargers reacts after being injured in the first quarter against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field, November 19, 2023, in Green Bay, Wisconsin.(Stacy Revere/Getty Images) It was just the fourth play of the game when Bosa immediately came off the fieldhobbling with a right foot ailment. He limped off the field on his own power, but he fell to his knees on the sideline before he was helped to the Chargers’ bench. Just a few moments later, Bosa was in tears on the cart. PACKERS HOLD OFF CHARGERS FOR CLOSE VICTORY In the second half, Bosa was seen back on the Chargers’ sideline, but he was walking with crutches and had a walking boot on. After the game, head coach Brandon Staley didn’t provide an update on what Bosa was dealing with. It’s a tough blow for Bosa, who has had injuries stymie his production since he broke out as one of the most feared edge rushers in the league in 2016, collecting 10.5 sacks to win Defensive Rookie of the Year that season. Bosa also made three straight Pro Bowls from 2019 to 2021. Joey Bosa of the Los Angeles Chargers is carted off the field after being injured in the first quarter against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on November 19, 2023, in Green Bay, Wisconsin.(Stacy Revere/Getty Images) However, a groin injury suffered in Week 3 last season was hard to come back from for Bosa, who played just five games. Then he dealt with a hamstring injury in Week 1 before fracturing his big toe in Week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings. The fractured toe was on Bosa’s left foot, and he was in a walking boot on his right. FROM OUTKICK:JOE BURROW DONE FOR SEASON AS AFC NORTH LOSES SECOND STARTING QUARTERBACK THIS WEEK Because of that, Bosa has been on a limited snap count. And based off his reaction, he might not be able to play the rest of the season. Bosa is second on the Chargers with 6.5 sacks this season, tallying 20 tackles, six of which were for loss. Los Angeles’ defense, though, has had troubles keeping offenses at bay this season, and losing a player like Bosa would be even more detrimental to this group.

DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY MAY IMPACT YOUNG ADULTS TWICE AS MUCH AS TEENS, HARVARD SURVEY FINDS The findings could help researchers better understand how antidepressants elevate mood and identify targets for new medications, according to a press release from Northwestern University. During the study, researchers implemented ""gentle"" techniques to keep the mice from falling asleep. Researchers found that an ""acute sleep loss period"" raised levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that boosts feelings of pleasure, in the brain.(i Stock) After staying up all night, the animals demonstrated more ""aggressive, hyperactive and hypersexual"" behavior compared to those that slept. The researchers also measured the animals’ dopamine activity in four regions of the brain, finding that it was higher in the sleep-deprived mice. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY MAY IMPACT YOUNG ADULTS TWICE AS MUCH AS TEENS, HARVARD SURVEY FINDS Most of the behavioral changes were gone a few hours later — yet the antidepressant effect continued for a few days after the sleep deprivation. Although there have been many studies done on the effects of chronic sleep loss, the impact of short-term sleep loss is less understood, according to study co-author Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy, an associate professor of neurobiology at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Sleep deprivation was also shown to rewire the brain to elevate mood for several days.(i Stock) ""We found that sleep loss induces a potent antidepressant effect and rewires the brain,"" said Kozorovitskiy in the release. ""This is an important reminder of how our casual activities, such as a sleepless night, can fundamentally alter the brain in as little as a few hours."" KIDS’ SLEEP PROBLEMS COULD BE INHERITED, NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS Dr. Shelby Harris, a New York-basedclinical psychologist and director of sleep health at Sleepopolis, was not involved in the study but shared her reactions to the outcome. ""The idea that staying up all night can temporarily alleviate depression is intriguing,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""There have been previous studies that have shown similar results, and there are some known mechanisms by which sleep deprivation could lead to improvements in mood."" The study researcher recommended ""hitting the gym or going for a nice walk"" to alleviate depression rather than pulling an all-nighter.(i Stock) Dr. Mirela Loftus, medical director for Newport Healthcarein New Jersey, was also not involved in the study but said it brings an ""enormous contribution"" to the ability to link high-level functions, such as mood and depression, to cellular mechanisms and dopamine network pathways. ""At least in this scenario, sleep deprivation did cause dopamine changes — specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex, which correlated with a reversal in the depressive-like behaviors in mice,"" she told Fox News Digital. The sleep experts cautioned against staying up all night as a means of curbing depression. Beyond increasing the release of dopamine, Harris said that sleep deprivation potentially could reset the brain's circadian rhythm, which could lead to improvements in mood and sleep quality. The study did have limitations, according to Harris. ""Those include its use of mice, focus on acute effects, lack of long-term follow-up, absence of confounding variable controls, small sample size and non-standardized affective state measure,"" she said. The sleep experts cautioned against staying up all night as a means of curbing depression. ""This study was done in mice and we have to wait for human-related studies,"" Loftus told Fox News Digital. A sleep expert warned that sleep deprivation is a ""temporary solution that can have negative consequences for both physical and mental health.""(i Stock) In patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the lack of sleep could trigger a manic episode, the doctor warned. ""In other words, don’t try this at home."" Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to problems with concentration, memory and learning, as well as accidents, injuries and chronic health conditions. The true value of the study, according to Loftus, is that it can aid in the development of newtreatments for depressiontargeting the neurotransmitter dopamine and the medial prefrontal cortex. While there could be a biological benefit to being ""intensely alert"" after a period of no sleep, Kozorovitskiy pointed out that the antidepressant effect is only ""transient."" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER ""I would say you are better off hitting the gym or going for a nice walk,"" she said in the release. ""This new knowledge is more important when it comes to matching a person with the right antidepressant.""

342,Fox News,Lifestyle Meet the American who gave the nation our Thanksgiving origin story,Kerry J. Byrne,"Mayflower passenger Edward Winslow was the only Pilgrim to record the settlers' first year in the New World — including an account of the very first Thanksgiving. It is the first and greatest American adventure story. A small band of Christian devotees, persecuted in their homeland, sought refuge in a forbidden wilderness across the vast ocean aboard a leaky ship in the autumn of 1620. Against all odds, following near death at sea, amid privation, disease and frightening loss of life, they planted the seeds ofa daring new society. Within a few generations their descendants brazenly challenged the world's monarchial order with the revolutionary statement that ""all men are created equal"" and fought to establish the first great constitutional republic. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK It became a haven for people just like them: the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. They are the Pilgrims.

This portrait, painted in London, is the only contemporary image we have of a Mayflower Pilgrim.(Interim Archives/Getty Images) Most everything we know about their first year in what'snow Plymouth, Massachusetts,from a contemporary, boots-on-the-ground, first-person source comes from one man. His name is Edward Winslow. ""He's a major figure in the Pilgrim story,"" Tom Begley, director of collections at Plimoth Patuxet Museums (known until 2020 as Plimoth Plantation), told Fox News Digital earlier. It is the only account, written as it happened, of the Pilgrims’ first year in Plymouth. ""He had the foresight to write down their story and share it with others."" Winslow wrote a lengthy letter to a friend back in England that has gone down in history as ""Mourt’s Relation."" It is the only account, written as it happened, of the Pilgrims’ first year in Plymouth. It is still in print, available on Amazon or at your local bookstore. A depiction of early settlers of the Plymouth Colony sharing a harvest Thanksgiving meal with members of the local Wampanoag tribe at the Plymouth Plantation, Plymouth, Massachusetts, 1621.(Frederic Lewis/Archive Photos/Getty Images) ""Mourt's Relation"" includes Winslow's brief, undated description of a three-day celebration in the autumn of 1621, after ""our harvest being gotten in,"" during which the English settlers and a much larger group of Wampanoag friends feast on fowl and deer. It isthe first Thanksgiving. Winslow’s account is the only version of the origin story of our national holiday written by Somebody Who Was There. ARIZONA GRANDMOTHER AND THE STRANGER SHE MISTAKENLY TEXTED WILL CELEBRATE 8TH THANKSGIVING TOGETHER Winslow made many other contributions to the Pilgrim narrative. He signed the Mayflower Compact, the first self-governing covenant among New World settlers, as the ship floated in Cape Cod Bay on Nov. 11, 1620. He was the first Pilgrim to meet Wampanoag chief Ousamequin, better known in history as Massasoit. The signatures on the Mayflower Compact of passengers on board the Mayflower in November 1620. The compact was the first governing document of Plymouth Colony. Included are the signatures of William Brewster, William Bradford, Myles Standish and, top left, Edward Winslow.(Three Lions/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) ""Winslow informed Massasoit that his people desired to have peace with him and engage in trading,"" James and Patricia Scott Deetz wrote in their 2000 history, ""The Times of Their Lives: Life, Love and Death in Plymouth Colony."" The two men bridged a cross-cultural relationship that benefited both sides for several decades before the outbreak of King Phillip's War in 1675. Winslow sat for a portrait in London, offering our only look at the face of an actual Pilgrim. Winslow also gives us our only look at the face of an actual Pilgrim. He sat for a portrait in London in 1651 after returning to England to serve its government under Protestant Parliamentarian Oliver Cromwell following the English Civil War. All other Pilgrim paintings and portraits were imagined after their time on Earth. ""History records no nobler venture for faith and freedom than that of this Pilgrim band,"" reads the tomb on a hill overlooking Plymouth Harbor today. A monument overlooking the harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts, marks the site where the Pilgrims buried their dead the first winter of 1620-21, when nearly half of the 100 settlers died. ""In hunger and cold they laid the foundations of a state wherein every man through countless ages should have liberty to worship God in his own way,"" reads the monument.(Kerry J. Byrne/Fox News Digital) It's the site where the settlers buried their many dead that first winter in the New World. Winslow gave future generations our eyewitness account of that noble venture. Edward Winslow was born on Oct. 18, 1595 to Edward Sr. and Magdalene (Oliver) Winslow in Droitwich Spa, a townin western Englandthat traces its history to Roman settlement.

Painting by William Halsall, 1882.(Barney Burstein/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) He moved to Leiden, Holland, in 1617 to live among the English separatist colony that produced the Pilgrims. He worked as a printer. ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, SEPT. 16, 1620, MAYFLOWER DEPARTS PLYMOUTH, ENGLAND He was just 24 when he departed Plymouth, England aboard the Mayflower with his wife Elizabeth (Barker) and younger brother Gilbert on Sept. 16, 1620. After a harrowing trip across the ocean and a month spent exploring Cape Cod, the Pilgrims anchored in Plymouth Harbor in late December. They began the seemingly impossible work of carving a new society out of the frozen earth. Winter on the New England coast is dark, windy and unforgiving even today, with the benefit of modern clothing, home heating systems, electricity and indoor plumbing.

The Pilgrims landed in Plymouth in late December 1620, at the start of a typically brutal Massachusetts winter.(Photo by John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Yet the Pilgrims landed in the middle of what's known as The Little Ice Age — a 500-year period of unusually cold weather. The Pilgrims ""were probably suffering from scurvy and pneumonia caused by a lack of shelter in the cold, wet weather."" England and Holland are north of Plymouth, but also far more temperate. The Pilgrims had never experienced anything as cold as a New England winter. Death soon gripped the colony. ""They were probably suffering from scurvy and pneumonia caused by a lack of shelter in the cold, wet weather,"" writes Plimoth Patuxet Museums. ""As many as two or three people died each day during their first two months on land."" Only 52 of 102 people survived the first year in Plymouth. The Mayflower sailed back to England with only half its crew alive in April 1621. People visit the 1627 Pilgrim Village at Plymouth Plantation where role-players portray Pilgrims seven years after the arrival of the Mayflower. The 17th century replica village was the site of the first Thanksgiving in 1621. Thanksgiving Day was established as a national holiday by President Lincoln in 1863, when he proclaimed its celebration on the last Thursday of November.(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Elizabeth Winslow was among the first winter’s victims. She died on March 24 at age 27 or 28. Pilgrim Susanna White lost her husband, William, in February. But new life, activity and hope emerged in the spring. GUTFELD: WOULD PILGRIMS FIND IT WEIRD TO EAT A PLANT-BASED BIRD? Edward and Susanna married on May 12, the first wedding in the Plymouth Colony. They began having children the following year. The Pilgrims in March met English-speaking Wampanoags Samoset and Squanto, who had learned the language from fishing boat captains seeking cod off the New England coast. Through Squanto, Winslow met chief Ousamequin. ""We have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us."" — ""Mourt’s Relation."" The Pilgrims began planting spring crops with the help of the Natives. They enjoyed an abundant harvest that autumn. The relationship appeared to blossom. ""We have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us,"" reports ""Mourt’s Relation."" ""We often go with them, and they come to us; some of us have been 50 miles by land in the country with them … We entertain them familiarly in our houses, and they as friendly bestowing their venison on us."" Engraving depicting American colonial leader Edward Winslow visiting Massasoit, leader of the Wampanoag Native Americans, circa 1641.(Photo by Archive Photos/Getty Images) The Natives were also overcoming shocking tragedy, notes Begley. Plague was unknowingly carried upon the ships of European explorers. The people of the Americas had no immunity. Up to 90% of the Native population of southern New England, according to expert estimates, was wiped out by disease from 1616 to 1619 — an apocalyptic tragedy. The Wampanoags were likely seeking hope and a reason to give thanks for their survival, too, in the autumn of 1621. The two sides cemented their friendly relations with agrand feast after the autumn harvest. Winslow described the first Thanksgiving in just 115 words of an extended sentence. A modern recreation of the first Thanksgiving in the autumn of 1621 at Plimoth Patuxet Museums (formerly Plimoth Plantation) in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Only half the Mayflower passengers, about 50, survived the first winter in Plymouth, while at least 90 Wampanoags attended the feast, according to Pilgrim Edward Winslow.(Courtesy of Kathy Tarantola/Plimoth Patuxet Museums) Winslow wrote, ""Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after have a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors; they four in one day killed as much fowl, as with a little help beside, served the company almost a week, at which time amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest King Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain, and others."" The celebrants ate fowl — plentiful in the area — and venison. The ""harvest"" certainly included corn, among other fruits and vegetables. AMERICA'S ‘UNIQUE’ THANKSGIVING STUFFING PREFERENCES STATE-BY-STATE We learn of Pilgrims eating turkey — later on — only from William Bradford’s history, ""Of Plymouth Plantation."" The first governor of Plymouth began writing his history in 1630. Hidden away for more than two centuries, Bradford's account was not published until 1856. He does not mention the feast. The entire Thanksgiving origin story comes from the one passage in ""Mourt's Relation."" The first Thanksgiving at Plymouth in 1621, painting from 1914. Private Collection. Artist Brownscombe, Jennie Augusta (1850-1936).(Photo by Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty Images) Winslow's account indicates that the Wampanoags vastly outnumbered the Pilgrims. Massasoit brought 90 men and, historians assume, perhaps an equal number of women and children. There were barely more than 50 English settlers in Plymouth at the time. ""Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after have a special manner rejoice together."" — Edward Winslow Winslow, most prophetically, offers the passage that turns the harvest feast into a celebration of Thanksgiving. ""And although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty."" The Pilgrims had gone from the brink of perishing to an abundance ""far from want"" in one growing season. Pilgrim Edward Winslow, portrayed by Michael Hall, reads a passage from the Bible with Leah Pearl, 8, of Nantucket, as she visited his home at the Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth, Massachusetts.(John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) It must have felt like a miracle. ""The first Thanksgiving marked the conclusion of a remarkable year,"" writes historian Nathaniel Philbrick in his gripping 2006 book, ""Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War."" ""The Pilgrims had gone from the brink of perishing to an abundance ‘far from want’ in one growing season."" ""By all rights, none of the Pilgrims should have emerged from the first winter alive."" Edward Winslow lived a life of more adventure after settling Plymouth and recording its dramatic story for posterity. He died at sea in the Caribbean reportedly of yellow fever, on May 7, 1655. Oliver Cromwell, the victorious Parliamentarian of the English Civil War, reportedly intended to have Winslow serve as governor of the colony in Jamaica.

FLU PREVENTION TIPS FROM FLORIDA'S SURGEON GENERAL: A ‘DAY-TO-DAY’ HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS KEY It's important to understand the signs and symptoms that should alert you to seek medical attention when you have a cold or the flu this winter season, he said. Here’s what to know. The common cold can be caused by as many as 200respiratory viruses, but the most prevalent is the rhinovirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. The flu is caused by influenza viruses that generally infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs, per the CDC. The common cold can be caused by as many as 200 respiratory viruses, but the most prevalent is the rhinovirus.(i Stock) The cold and flu share many of the same symptoms, which means it can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between the two conditions. People are generally sicker with the flu, experts agree.

""The cold and flu can sometimes be complicated by pneumonia, bacteremia and rarely even central nervous system involvement,"" Dr. James H. Conway, pediatric infectious disease physician and medical director of the immunization program at UW Health Kidsin Madison, Wisconsin, told Fox News Digital. When respiratory viruses infect the nose, the body responds by making mucus to help clear out the viruses, according to the CDC. SKELETONS FROM 1918 FLU PANDEMIC REVEAL CLUES ABOUT THOSE MOST LIKELY TO DIE, STUDY FINDS People may develop nasal congestion, which is more common with colds. They may also experience sneezing, coughing or a sore throat. Over the next several days, the mucus may change color to white, yellow or green. People may develop nasal congestion, which is more common with colds; they may also experience sneezing, coughing or a sore throat.(i Stock) This color change is a natural progression of a cold, so antibiotics that fight bacteria are not typically prescribed, per the CDC. Most people with colds don’t develop a fever, so that symptom combined withheadache and body achescould indicate influenza. Symptoms from a cold usually peak within two to three days. Conway recommends watching for symptoms that indicate a cold or flu may have turned into a more serious infection. These may include higher fevers, he said, since most viral infections don’t generally cause that symptom. COVID-19, FLU AND RSV VACCINES ARE ALL AVAILABLE THIS FALL: SEE WHAT SOME DOCTORS RECOMMEND AND WHY Other warning signs include shaking chills, fast or labored breathing, and any type of bad headache or confusion, he added.

COMMON OTC NASAL DECONGESTANTS WITH PHENYLEPHRINE DON’T WORK IN TABLET FORM, EXPERTS SAY If you are unsure whether your symptoms are serious, always talk to your health care provider, either in person or via a virtual appointment. ""The increased availability of telemedicine provides an opportunity for many individuals to describe their symptoms and other important clinical information (such as the presence of fever) without an in-person visit, so their clinician can determine whether further evaluation of treatment is needed in most cases,"" Fendrick told Fox News Digital.

348,Fox News,UFC fighter shoots shot with interviewer by asking most NSFW question of all time,Unknown," You are here: by Zach Dean November 18, 2023, 10:27 amupdated November 18, 2023, 12:48 pm Look, there’s no way to put any of what you’re about to read delicately, so I apologize in advance. Just remember, don’t blame me — blame UFCfighter Tom Aspinall. And now we go. Aspinall, who made news recently for taking an absolute blowtorch to heavyweight champ Jon Jones, attempted to build on that momentum with well-known influencer/interviewer Nina Drama. Drama, for those who don’t know — and I didn’t until about five minutes ago — is known for throwing out crazy and wild questions during her interviews. It’s sort of her shtick, as you’ll see. Anyway, Aspinall decided to turn the tables on her yesterday during a little sit-down and shoot his shot at the same time. Two birds, one stone! This was the craziest question any UFC fighter has ever asked me LOL.Full interview with Tom Aspinall on my YT channel: Nina Dramapic.twitter.com/AFlx5NU0ma Howdy doo! Such a bold move, and here’s the kicker … Nina here is apparently with the cameraman! Unreal move by Tom, but he’s also a UFC fighter so if anyonecan get away with it,it’s him. Also, let’s just go ahead and ask it and move on … fingered? Really? Feel like that was such a weird route to take, but I guess it is what it is. I’m not here to judge, just to report the news and let you, the people, make your own call. There. I said the word once and won’t again. Feel like I had to at least address it somehow. Anyway, moving on … Remember when I said asking wild questions during her interviews was sort of Nina’s thing? Earlier in the interview, she fired off this bad boy to one Tom Aprinall: Nina asking Tom about no-nut novemberpic.twitter.com/Fe9rh84Ah X “What day is it? I failed already.” Don’t forget, Aspinall is the same cat who told the world last springthat he spent most of his time rehabbing last year by watching pornhub. Obviously, this guy is big into sex. No two ways about it. Anyway, the above line was a good one. Funny stuff. Not as good as this classic, but not bad. Take it away, Cosmo!   Tom Aspinall UFC Zach grew up in Florida, lives in Florida, and will never leave Florida ... for obvious reasons. He's a reigning fantasy football league champion, knows everything there is to know about NASCAR, and once passed out (briefly!) during a lap around Daytona. He swears they were going 200 mph even though they clearly were not. You must belogged into post a comment.

351,Fox News,Crying Virgin Mary: Is it a MIRACLE?,Christine Rousselle,"An abbey in rural Gower, Missouri, has become a pilgrimage site due to the body of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster A statue of the Virgin Mary in the Mexican state of Colima that is reportedly weeping tears has drawn crowds of onlookers and questions about a potential miracle. The statue was first noticed ""crying"" in October — but videos of the statue's purported tears gained traction on social media in mid-November. The statue, which is encased in glass, is named the Virgin of Dolores. It's located in the town of El Chanal, which is near the city of Colima, the capital of the state with the same name. VIRGIN MARY STATUE WITHSTANDS EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY AS CATHEDRAL COLLAPSES: 'INSPIRING SYMBOL OF HOPE' ""Dolores"" translates to ""sorrow"" or pain."" In Catholicism, one of the titles of the Virgin Mary is Our Lady of Sorrows, inspired by a prophecy in the Gospel of Luke. A statue of the Virgin Mary located in the Mexican state of Colima is reportedly crying tears. Here are two views of the statue.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) ""So, a couple of tears started flowing,"" eyewitness Víctor Ramos told the news outlet CEN. Thestatue's eyes reddenedas she ""cried,"" claimed Ramos. ""Similarly, when we cry, and our eyes become red, the same happens to the image,"" Ramos said. WHAT ARE ANGEL NUMBERS AND WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SEEING THEM? Perhaps the statue's tears were a reaction to the ""violence rates that are being experienced here in the state of Colima, also here in the community,"" said Ramos. The U.S. Department of State is right now warning against traveling to the entire state of Colima due to ""crime and kidnapping."" In 2022, thecity of Colimahad a homicide rate of 181.94 homicides per 100,000 residents, said Mexico's Citizens’ Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice. This was the highest in the world. Videos of the statue's tears have gone viral on social media platforms.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) Ever since videos of the supposedly crying statue went viral on social media platforms, the church has experienced a slew of visitors hoping to see the crying statue for themselves. Two Catholic priests told Fox News Digital that they were hesitant to endorse any devotion to the supposedly miraculous occurrence. ""Often, there's a natural explanation for these sorts of things."" ""These phenomena have to be subject to thejudgment of the Church, which usually comes from the local bishop after an investigation and hearing experts on the matter,"" said Fr. Thomas Petri, O.P., president of the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, DC. ""Often, there's a natural explanation for these sorts of things,"" he said. But even after an investigation by Church authorities in which no natural reason is found, ""Catholics are not obliged to believe in these phenomena,"" said Petri. AS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH ""However, we can always be grateful for any event or occurrence that causes people to pause and think about God and heavenly realities,"" he added. Fr. Paul Hedman, a priest of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and a self-described ""skeptic"" on these types of phenomena, also urged caution. ""People should remain indifferent and not get too excited until the Church is able to investigate,"" he said. Some people have suggested that the statue of the Virgin Mary is crying due to the slew of violence in the city near where the statue is located.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) A crying statue, said Hedman, could be caused by something such as condensation, or ""outright fraud by those looking to make a buck."" ""I would generally encourage people to maintain a healthy skepticism — the truth will come forward, and it is better to be cautious than to pour your soul into something that turns out to be inauthentic,"" he said.

352,Fox News,Ensuring safety for OLDER drivers,Melissa Rudy,"As more doctors and nurses leave the profession, providers are turning to AI technology to help bridge the coverage gap, especially among older Americans. Young drivers must be a certain age to get a license — but it is less clear when older adults should hang up the keys. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of motor vehicle deaths involvingadults 65 and olderrose by 15%, exceeding 8,200 fatalities, according to data from the National Safety Council. Fox News Digital spoke to Tina Paff, president of Bick's Driving School of Western Hillsin Ohio, about how to ensure the safety of aging drivers — and how family members can recognize the potential warning signs. Paff heads up the Bick's Driver Rehabilitation Program, which evaluates older adults’ driving skills to determine whether to recommend they ""retire"" from operating vehicles. MOST SENIORS IN AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING, STUDY FINDS For family members and loved ones who are concerned about the risks of older adults driving, Paff identified several warning signs. Fox News Digital spoke with an expert about how to ensure safety on the road for aging drivers — and how family members can recognize the potential warning signs.(i Stock) Physical damage to vehicles.A key red flag is if the driver starts to get into minor accidents, which could indicate negligence behind the wheel. ""It might not be their fault, but it also could be because of the way they were performing on the road,"" Paff said. INTERNET USE BY SENIORS ON REGULAR BASIS COULD SLASH THEIR DEMENTIA RISK, STUDY SUGGESTS She recommended inspecting the outside of the senior’s car for signs of damage, such as dents and scratches on the bumpers. Another telltale sign is damage to the mirrors; this could indicate that the driver is tapping mailboxes or hitting curbs. Effects of medication.It’s important forfamily membersto understand the potential effects of any medications the driver is taking, Paff noted. ""Sometimes an older adult is going to feel like their driving is safer because they've slowed down, but it’s actually causing more problems,"" the expert noted.(i Stock) ""Starting a new medication or changing dosages can potentially change some of a person’s habits, including driving,"" she said. Slower driving.As adults age, they tend to start slowing down on the road, the expert said. ""Sometimes an older adult is going to feel like their driving is safer because they've slowed down, but it’s actually causing more problems,"" she noted. Vision changes.As older adults’ vision becomes challenged, it’s essential that they see an eye doctor to get evaluated for glasses or corrective procedures, said Paff. 81-YEAR-OLD FITNESS TRAINER OFFERS SMART WORKOUT TIPS FOR SENIORS: ‘IT'S GREAT TO BE FIT' ""In cases of macular degeneration, they could start having some blind spots in their vision and not see a car or a person,"" she warned. Mild cognitive impairment.The Driver Rehabilitation Program often works with physicians to determine recommendations for older drivers’ abilities. ""‘Mild cognitive impairment’ is a very generalized term that we hear a lot from doctors,"" Paff said. If an older adult is starting to experience early signs ofdementia or Alzheimer’s, it can show in their driving skills. A key red flag is if the driver starts to get into minor accidents, which could indicate negligence behind the wheel.(i Stock) ""One of the biggest signs that we see with cognitive impairment is what we call processing speed,"" Paff said. ""Even though the adult will know how to make a left turn in traffic and yield, they may be delayed in doing it."" Additionally, if an older adult starts shuffling or walking extremely slowly, the family might chalk it up to a regular effect of aging, Paff said — but that could also delay their reaction time when driving. When it comes to determining whether a senior should continue driving, it’s not always a clear-cut ""yes or no"" decision. In many cases, Paff said, families or doctors’ offices will contact Bick’s to request a safety evaluation for a senior driver. ONE IN SIX TEENS ADMITS TO DROWSY DRIVING, SURVEY FINDS: IT'S 'IMPAIRED DRIVING, UNEQUIVOCALLY' Adult children often say they aren’t comfortable riding in the car with an aging parent. ""If you're scared, then something is wrong,"" Paff said. ""And that’s where we come in with the evaluation, because the kids don't want to be ‘the bad guy’ and take away a parent’s driver's license."" During a two-hour assessment, Bick’s gauges the driver’svision skills, physical skills and cognitive skills, then takes them on a driver’s test. When it comes to determining whether a senior should continue driving, it’s not always a clear-cut ""yes or no"" decision. Sometimes modifications can be put into place to ensure a safer driving experience. ""There are often things we can do to help them continue driving that a son or daughter wouldn't think of,"" Paff said. As people get older and experience spinal changes, for example, they might not be able to turn their necks as fully as they once could. As older adults’ vision becomes challenged, it’s essential that they see an eye doctor to get evaluated for glasses or corrective procedures, said Paff.(i Stock) ""We might recommend different styles of mirrors that can be applied to the car that show all the blind spots for people with limited mobility,"" Paff said. There may also be an opportunity to modify seating to meet older drivers’ needs. There are currently no U.S. states that require seniors to give up their licenses due to their age. Even when driving the same car they’ve operated for years, they may not be able to see properly due to shrinkage, Paff noted. ""In that case, it may just be a matter of using seat cushions,"" she said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER There are scenarios where the evaluators determine the driver isn’t fit to drive. ""We don’t have the power to take away a driver's license, nor does the Department of Motor Vehicles,"" Paff said. ""In those cases, we notify thedriver’s physicianof the recommendation to put it into the medical record."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Although driving laws vary across the country, there are currently no U.S. states that require seniors to give up their licenses due to their age, according to Progressive’s website.

""And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, ‘Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.’ And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them"" (Mark 10:13-16). These verses come from the Gospel of Mark, one of the three synoptic Gospels. The Gospel of Mark is attributed to St. Mark the Evangelist.

""That is certainly possible,"" he said. Another narrative from the Gospel of Mark, however, provides a ""more plausible"" explanation, he said.

357,Fox News,What happens when you SKIP the SALT?,Melissa Rudy,". An estimated 61.9 million U.S. adults are onblood pressure medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — but a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that cutting just 1 teaspoon of salt each day could have the same effect. Researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Northwestern Medicine and the University of Alabama at Birmingham studied a cohort of 213 individuals aged 50 to 75 years. The participants were evaluated while eating their normal foods; they also followed alow-sodium dietfor a week and a high-sodium diet for another week. SKIPPING THE SALT CAN REDUCE HEART DISEASE RISK BY ALMOST 20%, STUDY FINDS: ‘KNOW WHAT YOU ARE CONSUMING’ ""Most middle-aged to elderly individuals consume a diet that is very high in sodium,"" said Deepak Gupta, MD, associate professor of Medicine at VUMC and co-principal investigator, in a statement to Fox News Digital. A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that cutting just 1 teaspoon of salt per day could have the same effect as blood pressure medications.(i Stock) ""Compared with an individual’s usual diet, a low-sodium diet lowered systolic blood pressure by 6 mm Hg, which is an effect comparable to that of a commonly utilized medication forhigh blood pressure."" In the study, the participants reduced their salt intake by about 1 teaspoon a day compared with their usual diet. ASK A DOC: 'HOW CAN I PREVENT HIGH CHOLESTEROL?' One tablespoon of salt contains approximately 2,300 mg of sodium. ""The magnitude of blood pressure reduction with a low-sodium diet was similar across individuals with normal blood pressure, controlled hypertension, untreated hypertension and uncontrolled hypertension,"" Gupta told Fox News Digital. Hypertension is the leading risk factor for death worldwide, affecting more than one billion people globally, according to data from the World Heart Federation.(i Stock) Some 70% to 75% of the study participants saw a reduction in their blood pressure, regardless of whether they were already on medication, according to co-principal investigator Norrina Allen, Ph D, professor of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in a press release. The results were also presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2023in Philadelphia. WANT A MORE ACCURATE BLOOD PRESSURE READING? TRY LYING DOWN WHEN IT'S TAKEN, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS ""We previously didn’t know if people already on blood pressure medication could actually lower their blood pressure more by reducing their sodium,"" said Allen in the release. ""This reinforces the importance of reduction in dietary sodium intake to help control blood pressure, even among individuals taking medication for hypertension."" ""Sodium is a key player in maintaining blood pressure, as it attracts water and causes more fluid absorption from your gut,"" a doctor told Fox News Digital in light of the new study.(i Stock) Also notable is how quickly the participants’ blood pressure dropped in the week that they followed the low-sodium diet. ""The fact that blood pressure dropped so significantly in just one week and was well-tolerated is important and emphasizes the potential public health impact of dietary sodium reduction in the population, given that high blood pressure is such a huge health issue worldwide,"" said co-investigator Cora Lewis, M.D., professor of medicine at the University of Alabamaat Birmingham, in the release. ""People have a real shot at improving their health through improving their diet in this way."" ""It is particularly exciting that the products we used in the low-sodium diet are generally available, so people have a real shot atimproving their healththrough improving their diet in this way."" Dr. Bradley Serwer, a Maryland-basedcardiologist and chief medical officer at Vital Solution, a company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, was not involved in the study but reviewed its findings. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that adults stick to 1,500 mg or less of sodium per day.(i Stock ) ""This degree of improvement is comparable to taking blood pressure medication, but without any side effects,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Sodium is a key player in maintaining blood pressure, as it attracts water and causes more fluid absorption from your gut,"" the doctor went on. A SINGLE ALCOHOLIC DRINK PER DAY COULD RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE, SAYS STUDY ""This results in more fluid volume in the bloodstream, which in turn results in higher pressures and more workload for the heart."" The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that adults stick to 1,500 mg or less of sodium per day. ""High blood pressure can lead to heart failure, heart attacks and strokes because it puts extra pressure on your arteries,"" one of the study authors warned.(i Stock) The total daily sodium intake recommended by the AHA is 1,500 milligrams, and this study was designed to decrease it even lower than that, Allen said.

NASA intends to build civilian housing on the lunar surface using 3D-printing robots within two decades, according to several of the organization's scientists. The agency is developing concepts for lunar rocket landing pads, 3D printers, concrete mixtures, construction robots and more to complete structures that would shelter humans on the moon by 2040,according to the New York Times.

""This infrastructure may comprise systems including modern surface habitats, rovers, laboratory capabilities, power generation and storage, and tools and equipment."" To do this, the space agency partnered with ICON, a Texas-based construction company thatspecializes in printing buildings. For instance, four NASA scientists have currently spent over 130 days in a 1,700-square-foot ICON-printed dwelling constructed tosimulate a yearlong deployment to Mars. ""The first thing that needs to happen is a proof of concept. Can we actually manipulate the soil on the lunar surface into a construction material?""

Earlier this month, the Ivy League said it was establishing an antisemitism task force to address the ""terribly resilient"" hatred Jewish students faced on campus. Another Jewish student who requested anonymity out of safety concerns said she ""has lost a lot of friends"" since the startof the Israel-Hamas war. ""As a Jewish student who has been advocating for Palestinian liberation for many years and who also identifies as a Zionist, I have felt very scared on this campus,"" she told Fox News.

362,Fox News,Groups fear faculty that defended Hamas could set California standards: 'Institutionalization of antisemitism’,Hannah Ray Lambert,"More than 100 groups are urging the University of California to nix a proposed ethnic studies admission requirement after faculty said ""the quiet part out loud."" Dozens of religious and educational organizations are urging the University of California to reject a proposed ethnic studies admission requirement in light of an influential faculty council's defense of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. ""The ethnic studies faculty at the University of California have essentially taken off their mask and shown themselves to be completely sympathetic to the anti-Zionist, pro-Hamas cause,"" said Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, director of the AMCHA Initiative, which tracks antisemitism at universities. UCLA students march and rally for Palestine on Nov. 8, 2023. A university council that came under fire for its comments on Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel is leading the charge to require all UC applicants to take an ethnic studies course in high school.(Getty) BLUE STATE SUSPENDS BASIC SKILLS GRADUATION REQUIREMENT AGAIN, CITING HARM TO STUDENTS OF COLOR The controversy is twofold, centering on the state's high school ethnic studies mandate and a separate proposal to make completion of an ethnic studies course a requirement for admission to the University of California. The latter faces renewed opposition after one of the key groups advocating for the requirementpenned a letterdemanding UC administrators stop referring to Hamas’ attack on Israel as ""terrorism."" ""Through ethnic studies, what we're seeing is the institutionalization of antisemitism,"" said Brandy Shufutinsky of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies, which opposes narrow and ""radical"" ideological agendas in education. In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill making California the first stateto require all students to complete an ethnic studies course in order to graduate. The bill came after a long debate over the model curriculum, early drafts of which AMCHA Initiative and other Jewish groups arguedcontained antisemitic material. That requirement takes effect with the graduating class of 2030, though schools must start offering classes by the 2025-26 school year. But in 2020, as legislators were arguing over the state mandate, the UC faculty senate Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) began considering a proposal to add ethnic studies as an ""H"" requirement for admission to UC colleges. Currently, allhigh schoolapplicants must satisfy what are known as the A-G subject requirements, including history, English, math, science and art. A UC mandate would effectively usurp the state law, which grants each school district the freedom to decide what to include in ethnic studies courses, according to Rossman-Benjamin. WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE If approved, it would push every public and private high school in the state to require not just an ethnic studies class, but one ""that met the standards of the UC ethnic studies faculty,"" she said. Otherwise, students would not be eligible to apply to UC schools, nor California State University, which has the same course requirements,Ed Source reported. The UC Ethnic Studies Faculty Council has been instrumental in crafting and advocating for the admissions requirement. Drafts of the course criteria placed a heavy emphasis on ""anti-racist and anti-colonial liberation."" The council recently renewed the call for BOARS to approve the requirement, noting that ethnic studies scholars have revised the course criteria five times ""in response to input from non-expert stakeholders."" Fox News reached out to several members of the Ethnic Studies Faculty Council leadership requesting an interview or comment, but did not get a response addressing the proposed admissions requirement.

""We call on the UC administrative leadership to retract its charges of terrorism, to uplift the Palestinian freedom struggle, and to stand against Israel’s war crimes against and ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people,"" the council wrote last month. Shufutinsky, an education consultant with the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies, said she was shocked the council ""felt very comfortable saying the quiet part out loud."" ""But that's also beneficial because now we are very aware of exactly where they stand and why we have to stand against the proposals that they're making,"" she told Fox News. AMCHA and more than 100 other religious, education and civil rights organizations signed a letter urging UC leadership to ""immediately"" reject the ""H"" requirement, arguing that ""faculty who cannot acknowledge that the Hamas massacre is terrorism … must not be trusted to establish state-wide ethnic studies standards for California students."" Rossman-Benjamin said she thinks the proposal is ""dead in the water"" now. ""It's sort of a no-brainer to say, 'This is just not gonna happen. It can't happen. This is an outrage,'"" she said. ""The people who devised this proposal have shown themselves to be so sort of bigoted and ultimately un-academic, un-scholarly, politically-motivated activists who will harm our kids and harm our communities.""

""There's this whole idea that we've seen, unfortunately, since Oct. 7, that anything an oppressed group of people does to a so-called oppressor group of people is legitimized, and it's acceptable,"" she said. But the faculty council views critics as trying to suppress the teaching of ""hard truths"" about ""settler colonialism, apartheid, and resistance."" Now we are very aware of exactly where they stand and why we have to stand against the proposals that they're making In September, the council wrote to Newsom and California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, objecting to ""guardrails"" written into the high school mandate. Specifically, the council opposes a ban on promoting ""bias, bigotry, or discrimination against any person or group of persons on the basis of any category protected by Section 220"" of the stateeducational code. ""This guardrail has been weaponized by pro-Israel groups to enact anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian censorship,"" the council wrote.

365,Fox News,Judge tosses New Hampshire teachers union bid to shoot down voucher program,Joshua Q. Nelson,"Former Education Secretary Betsy De Vos calls for power to be given back to families by providing school choice on 'The Story.' The New Hampshire Superior Courton Wednesday dismissed a teachers union’s challenge to the state’s voucher program, which argued that the use of public money to fund private schools was unconstitutional. Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Amy L. Ignatius ruled that the AFT failed to prove the measureviolates the Constitution. According to In Depth New Hampshire, who procured notes from the case, Ignatius said that ""the burden of proof is on Howes to prove it is unconstitutional."" Howes had failed to do so. ""The court’s decision is disappointing but not surprising,""according to a statementby American Federation of Teachers-New Hampshire President Deb Howes. AFT’s lawsuit was filed last yearin Merrimack. The suit sought an injunction to stop the voucher-like program. Howes explained further that according to state law, lottery funds should only be used to fund public schools and the Education Trust Fund, not vouchers. The American Federation of Teachers filed a lawsuit in Merrimack County Superior Court last year to stop a voucher-like program.(i Stock) TEXAS STRUGGLES TO PASS UNIVERSAL SCHOOL CHOICE, BUCKING A TREND OF RED STATES THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE The Education Trust Fund, which was established to distribute education grants to school districts, was amended this year to include vouchers. The vouchers are facilitated through Education Freedom Accounts [EFA]. ""The Legislature should be focusing far more time and resources on the needs of the 160,000 Granite State public school students who deserve a robust curriculum and fully staffed schools, not on the 4,000 students whose families choose to take state-funded vouchers,"" Howes said. Howes added that vouchershave ""exacerbated an already disparate burden placed on local property taxpayers to fund the basic right to a quality public education."" CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION PRESIDENT USED 'UNLAWFUL DEDUCTION' ON HOME IN INDIANA FOR OVER A DECADE Merrimack County Superior Court judge ruled that the American Federation of Teachers failed to prove that using public dollars to fund private schools violates the Constitution.(Getty Images) Back in October, New Hampshire’s Department of Education reported that more than 4,200 students from economically disadvantaged homes were enrolled in EFAs. EFA enrollment increasedby over 800 students from the end of the 2022-2023 academic year to the start of the 2023-2024 academic year, an increase of about 20 percent. Red-state governors across the country have passed universal school choice legislation, igniting what experts call a ""revolution.""(Fox News Digital) Teachers unions typicallylobby against school choice because they claim it siphons off taxpayer funding that is being allocated into other educational options and instead could be used to boost teachers' salaries, invest in public school facilities, and recruit more teachers. TEXAS BLACK, URBAN VOTERS SUPPORT SCHOOL CHOICE WHILE RURAL VOTERS REJECT IT, ACCORDING TO NEW SURVEY When parents have optionsoutside public schools such as homeschooling or charter schools, public school functions could be debilitated. The AFT New Hampshire did not respond to a request for comment. Reacting to the outcome of the case, American Federation For Children Senior Fellow Corey De Angelis told Fox News Digitalthat ""power-hungry teachers unions were just dealt a major L in New Hampshire."" ""Education freedom is here to stay, and there’s nothing Randi Weingarten and her union stooges can do about it,"" he said. He went on to say, ""Teachers unions should hang their heads in shame after this attempt to trap kids in their failing government schools. Parents deserve the right to direct the upbringing of their own children, and school choice gives them real power. Kids don't belong to the government.

366,Fox News,'Lazy Girl jobs' and ditching the 9-5. Gen Z's parents have failed them,Carol Roth,"Americans in New York City tried to decode the most popular Gen Z slang words. They guessed the meaning of slang words like ""living rent-free"" and ""ghosting."" Mysocial media feedsare filled with reposts from Tik Tok videos featuring Gen Z having a lot of issues with work. ""Lazy Girl Jobs"" encouraging women to seek out low-stress, minimal-effort, possibly remote jobs (but of course, high-paying ones) became a viral phenomenon. One young womenshared an on-camera breakdownover working 9-5, because, with commute, she was tired and didn’t have enough ""free time."" While it’s easy to dunk on these young people, I really blame the parents. This hurts, because Gen Z is being raised in large part by Gen X, which should make the kids awesome and self-sufficient. Gen Z is being raised in large part by Gen X, which should make the kids awesome and self-sufficient. But alas, as we keep witnessing across social media, many young people are struggling. Here’s where they have been let down and how they can change it around. WHAT GEN Z WANTS TO CANCEL MOST – THE ANSWER ABOUT MY GENERATION WILL SURPRISE YOU Not Preparing Gen Z for Work With young people consuming so much Marxist propaganda onlineand even in school, it is not entirely surprising that young people want to do as little work as possible and just expect that food, clothing, shelter, entertainment and more will just fall from the sky for them. When you are young, you start from square one. You probably don’t have much of a net worth (or perhaps a negative one like I did from college loans). You don’t have a lot of experience. So, yes, you have to work hard to take care of your needs and wants. And then, over time, you can earn extra free time if you desire it. That doesn’t mean you should neglect self-care, it just means you need to be realistic and efficient. If you are too tired to work out when you get home because of a long commute, work out closer to your work’s location when you have more energy. If meal prep is getting you down, prepare your meals on Sunday evening for the week. Finally, give it perspective. If you have a job you love or a great opportunity to learn, focus on what is amazing about those opportunities to which others don’t have access. GEN Z GETS WAKE-UP CALL ON HOW THE ‘REAL WORLD’ WORKS: ‘SUCCESS ISN’T HANDED TO YOU,' SAYS YOUNG PROFESSIONAL Not Giving Them Self-Worth When I was young, my father instilled in me a sense of pride for whatever I did. Whether it was making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as a worker in the kitchen of a day camp (yes, I did that job) to writing bestselling books now, whatever I do, my name goes on it and I take putting my name on my work seriously. Many young people don’t have pride in themselves or their work, which is their personal art and contribution to the world. The idea that you are seeking to be a lazy girl is absolutely emblematic of not having pride in yourself and how you spend your time. It doesn’t mean that you have to kill yourself with work, but you have a privilege that very few people around the world and throughout history have had – you can choosehow you want to earn a livingand support yourself, and you have a wide variety of choices, which you can change fairly easily and frequently throughout your life. A DISTURBING GEN Z SOCIAL MEDIA TREND THREATENS AMERICA'S MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION Whatever you do, give yourself your all and be proud of what you are contributing to others and to your own self-fulfillment. Teaching Them About a Diary When I was growing up, young people who were going through challenges worked out their problems in a couple of ways. One was a diary, where they could vent their frustrations on paper, and nobody was meant to read it. Or, perhaps, we sought counsel via a phone call with a friend or a discussion with a sibling. What we did not do is create a production to share with the world and for millions of strangers to comment on (like I am doing here). Personal growth can be a challenge at any age, but it is amplified when you are young. As a young person, that’s your personal struggle, and you do not need to broadcast that to the world (again, something that your parents should have taught you). CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Trying to use every aspect of your personal life for clicks or other attention isn’t healthy and will end up causing more harm than good. In fact, it would be healthy to step away from the phone and learn to live in the moment in all that you do. Try to get outside and just enjoy it. You don’t need to share what you are doing, you don’t need to do a broadcast or view nature through a phone camera lens. Just take the time to be present and enjoy the world yourself without feeling the need to include everyone or get their approval. Mentorship for Gen Z Mentorship can help Gen Z reach their potential. Where their parents may have failed, other people in their life can help. Young people should seek out relationships with people that they admire (in real life, not on Tik Tok and Instagram) and get feedback when they are struggling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are plenty of people who have decades of experience that can help make them more at ease with their personal and professional choices and with their perspective. And, people are usually very willing to help if you ask kindly and make it easy for them to do so. What Gen Z needs to learnis that growth, challenges and struggles are all a normal part of life, but broadcasting those to the world is not.

TOM COTTON:It's not just that governors have banned it [Tik Tok], Joe Biden has banned it. We passed legislation last year that banned Tik Tok on U.S. Government devices. Yet, Joe Biden's campaign is now thinking, apparently, about going on to Tik Tok. So just think about that. You have all of these senior aides at the White House who carry two phones, one government phone on which they can't download Tik Tok, and one personal campaign phone on which they'll be obsessively checking Tik Tok to look at Joe Biden's campaign account. This has probably resulted, in part, from Joe Biden's polling collapse, especially among young voters or other core Democratic constituencies. That campaign is desperate to do anything, even use a Chinese propaganda app to try to offset Joe Biden's decline in the polls. Joe Biden's campaign shouldn't do it, and President Biden should sign a total ban of Tik Tok into law next month. BIDEN CAMP WEIGHS JOINING TIKTOK TO SWAY YOUNG VOTERS MONTHS AFTER PURGING APP FROM FEDERAL DEVICES: REPORT Axios first reported on Friday that Biden's team was considering using the platform, owned by the Chinese company Byte Dance, though a spokesman for the president's re-election downplayed the story.

""It reads like a movie script and a horror movie script, when you detail all of those things that were missed,"" Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican from Iowa, said Sunday on""FOX & Friends Weekend."" Jia Bei Zhu, 62, who was behind the lab, was reportedly a Chinese citizen and a wanted fugitive from Canada. ""We want to know how he was able to obtain these pathogens. How is he able to get away with running a lab, getting millions of dollars sent to him from the Chinese Communist Party and then obviously coming into our country stealing American intellectual property?"" she continued. OWNER OF CALIFORNIA BIOLAB HAS CLOSE TIES TO CHINESE GOVERNMENT, MILITARY: HOUSE REPORT Bottles and other items in containers in a biolab in Fresno, California.(City of Reedley) Last week, the House Select Committeeon the People’s Republic of China (PRC) announced he allegedly had ties to the Chinese government. Authorities also reported Zhu had stolen millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and was part of an ongoing transnational criminal enterprise with ties to the PRC. He was arrested in October, months after a code enforcement officer first raised eyebrows about a green garden hose sticking out of a hole at the location - a code violation that spawned further inspection with alarming results, including the discovery of thousands of vials containing biological substances and mice used for disease research. Hinson, like others, is concerned that more could be hidden across the U.S., posing a threat to national security. ""The FBI and the CDC really dropped the ball here in terms of investigating not only this illegal lab, but now we wonder how many more labs like this exist in the country,"" she said. FBI DIRECTOR SAYS COVID PANDEMIC 'MOST LIKELY' ORIGINATED FROM CHINESE LAB Mice used in testing at the China-linked biolab in California.(City of Reedley) ""So clearly, we have some work to do to make sure we're prepared, because we know China is doing everything they can to constantly undermine us."" The House Select Committee on the PRC further claimed that both the FBI and the CDC were contacted by local law enforcement, but the agencies declined to investigate. Officials later contacted Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., who pressed the CDC to get involved, prompting the agency to conduct an investigation that reportedly unearthed ""at least 20 potentially infectious agents,"" but eventually wrote that the investigation unearthed ""no evidence of select agents or toxins"" in a three-page report on the findings. Local officials – and House members critical of the investigation – simultaneously argue the agency's actions fell short.

Kevin Mc Carthy, R-Calif., said. ""But when the CDC showed up they should’ve done what was right then, and they did not. They did not test the pathogens. They did not even find all of them. They left a freezer with Ebola in it, and we know how lethal that is…"" The CDC responded to claims made in the House committee's report on the biolab investigation, issuing the following statement: ""CDC strongly disputes the report’s conclusions critical of the agency. The report includes numerous inaccuracies, including both the charge that CDC did not respond to local requests for aid and the false implication that CDC had the authorityto unilaterally investigate or seize samples from PBI’s Reedley building. Indeed, CDC has, and continues to be actively engaged, within its regulatory authorities, in the intergovernmental efforts to address issues surrounding the facility."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, President Biden welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit last week, garnering additional criticism from Republicans. ""It's a true slap in the face to Americans,"" Hinson continued on Sunday. ""The Newsom administration and the Biden administration really rolled out the red carpet for President Xi. A genocidal dictator came to town, theycleaned up San Francisco, did a parade that was fitting for a hero's welcome, and then hosted him as a guest of honor at a boozy dinner. Meanwhile, in Reedley, California, we're busting an illegal biolab…"" ""They had over a thousand mice that were designed to transmit COVID. So this administration needs to hold China accountable for its role in spreading COVID around the world, and it's very clear of their intention here, which was to do more damage to our country,"" she said.

Several family members of Americans murdered on September 11, 2001, spoke out to FOX Newson what led to Usama bin Laden's ""Letter to America"" going viral on Tik Tok and praised by youth online. Terry Strada, the wife of Twin Towers victim Tom Strada, said on ""America Reports"" Friday she is sickened by the fact Gen Zers who did not necessarily live through 9/11 are suddenly entranced by bin Laden's anti-Zionist and anti-American screed the militant claimed justified the attacks he planned. ""I find it appalling,"" she said. ""I mean, it's hard to find words to describe just how upsetting this is to the entire 9/11 community, to have to see these young people out there."" ""But the truth is, is that they are very misinformed, and they are uneducated and ignorant on the subject."" BIN LADEN LETTER TRENDING SHOWS HOW EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILED GEN Z: CRITICS Strada blamed American political leaders and executive branch bureaucrats who she said have hidden the truth and protected the Saudi Arabian government amid allegations they helped fund the attacks. ""We have had spineless — and I mean spineless — leaders in the White House and in the State Department that choose to protect the kingdom of Saudi Arabia over the American people knowing the truth, and we have to remember that the truth is what will always be our best weapon against history repeating itself,"" she said. ""And as long as we have government, our officials that continue to protect the truth from being told, which is that the kingdom fundedthis terroristattack, they funded Al-Qaeda, which spread the Wahhabism, which spread this radical Islamism that this young group of people that were born before 9/11 are just so unaware of, because it's not taught in our schools and the parents aren't aware of it."" She called on the feds to take decisive action to stem this trend. Brett Eagleson, whose father died on 9/11, added that the trend forwarded onplatforms like Tik Tokis an inherent threat to the United States itself. BILL MAHER SCOLDS OBAMA'S 'MORAL EQUIVALENCY' ON ISRAEL-HAMAS: HE ‘DISAPPOINTED ME’ ""[T]his is unbelievable. There are not enough horrible words to describe… what is happening right now in America. This is an existential threat to this country if we were going to have kids of that generation, children on Tik Tok trying to in some way whitewash what happened on 9/11… "" said Eagleson, who was 15 when his father Bruce died at the Twin Towers. ""It all starts in the education system."" Eagleson pointed to some rays of hope, namely in actions by people like Florida Republican Gov. Ron De Santis, who shepherded state legislation to mandate 9/11 be taught in public schools. He said many states don't require it and it's not federally required curricula either — adding those defending or giving the benefit of the doubt to malign entities worldwide should realize they could be victimized themselves by the same ilk. ""So we need to… start re-educating America, and to the Tik Tokers that are saying these inflammatory remarks: You should all know that Hamas and Al-Qaeda and people that you are supporting and giving credibility to would not hesitate one second to kill you or kidnap you and your family and hold you ransom simply based on the color of your skin or your gender identity or your nationality or your religion,"" he said. Later on FOX News, Matt Bocchi — who lost his father on 9/11 — said it is appalling to see youngsters disseminating such propaganda without being grounded in the knowledge of what happened that day. ""It just unfortunately shows the reality that these teenagers are being spread misinformation and how they're finding sympathy for bin Laden is beyond me,"" he told ""The Story"" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This is an individual who was the perpetrator in a tragedy that took nearly 3,000 innocent Americans, my dad included, and this is something that is extremely hurtful to all of us."" Bocchi said following the 2001 attacks, he encountered a rough road of addiction and other struggles, adding he would search the videos of the North Tower to see if he could find his father clinging to a window ledge. He added the CCP-linked Tik Tok should at least reach a point where it is ""monitored"" by U.S. officials, if not entirely be forced to be sold to American interests — and that young minds are being ""polluted"" by what they're seeing on the app. For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion and channel coverage, visitfoxnews.com/media.

370,Fox News,"Impeachment process the best way to hold Mayorkas, Biden accountable for border crisis: Stephen Miller",Charles Creitz,"Former Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' to criticize open-border crisis. Former President Donald Trump'serstwhile speechwriter told FOX News it is ""absolutely critical"" that the Republican-led House send articles of impeachment to the Senate against both President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Stephen Miller, now the head of America First Legal, told ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" in an interview airing Saturday that critics who point to federal immunity for top officeholders are proving why impeachment is the strongest tactic through which to hold both men accountable for the border crisis and its repercussions. ""It is absolutely critical that articles of impeachment be sent from the House to the Senate for both Mayorkas and Biden for their conspiracy to commit human trafficking, drug trafficking, smuggling, illegal immigration and the violation of dozens of federal immigration statutes,"" he said. Miller echoed countless Republicans who have claimed the Biden administration's apparent refusal to properly and fully enforce federal immigration laws essentially equates to dereliction of duty and the impetus behind the rampant human trafficking and drug crisis into the nation's interior. Mayorkas(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ""People will say, well, they have federal immunity for these crimes,"" added Miller, who also formerly worked for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. ""That's the reason why the impeachment process is so essential: You must use the impeachment process to hold them accountable and remove them from power."" Recent attempts by lawmakers to impeach both men have either failed or stalled, but a House inquiry into Bidenled by committee chairs James Comer, R-Ky., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Jason Smith, R-Mo., continues at present. Earlier this week, ahandful of Republicanshowever crossed the aisle to join Democrats in torpedoing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's, R-Ga., impeachment resolution against Mayorkas. Greene had alleged Mayorkas engaged in a ""pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of the United States,"" saying he failed to uphold and defend the laws of the United States. Greene has also been behind other impeachment effortsagainst Biden, as in articles of impeachment following the Afghanistan withdrawal which called for ""impeaching Joseph Robinette Biden, president of the United States, for dereliction of duty by leaving behind thousands of American civilians and Afghan allies along with numerous taxpayer-financed weapons and military equipment, endangering the lives of the American people and the security of the United States."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In another attempt, the Georgia Republican alleged Biden ""compromised our national security"" and ""thwart[ed] the will of Congress"" by failing to enforce immigration laws. In a House Homeland Security Committee hearing earlier this week, Rep. Michael Mc Caul, R-Texas, addressed Mayorkas directly on the matter, citing from federal statute 18 USC 2 that ""whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.’ Mc Caul told Mayorkas a ""criminal enterprise"" of human and fentanyl trafficking has burgeoned in the U.S. under his tenure: ""Sir, I would argue that you have been aiding and abetting the deaths and the criminal enterprise that has occurred in this nation,"" Mc Caul said Wednesday.

As news of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter’sdeath continues to spread, many political leaders are turning to social media to honor her legacy. The wife of former President Jimmy Carter died with her family by her side at her home in Plains, Georgia,on Sunday at the age of 96. President Biden spoke about the former first lady while making a stop in Norfolk, Virginia on Sunday, though there appeared to be a little confusion from the Commander in Chief. ""Today she was put in hospice. I was on the phone with her family, and I was speaking to her grandson,"" Biden said. "" You know, they are really an incredible family, because they brought so much grace to the office.""

In an official statement, Biden said Carter ""walked her own path, inspiring a nation and the world along the way."" ""She was a champion for equal rights and opportunities for women and girls; an advocate for mental health and wellness for every person; and a support of the often unseen and uncompensated caregivers of our children, aging loved ones, and people with disabilities,"" the president said. Former President Donald Trump called Carter ""a great humanitarian,"" and like others, acknowledged the longevity of her 77-year-marriage to former President Carter. ""Over a life spanning nearly a century, Rosalynn Carter earned the admiration and gratitude of our entire nation,"" Trump said.

When the Obamas were in the White House, Michelle said, Carter would join her for lunch ""every so often,"" and offer words of advice and ""always"" a helping hand. ""She reminded me to make the role of First Lady my own, just like she did,"" Obama said. ""I’ll always remain grateful for her support and generosity.

Former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid tribute to Carter, calling her a compassionate and committed champion of human dignity.

374,Fox News,Texas Gov. Abbott endorses Trump for 2024 GOP presidential bid,Greg Wehner,"MAGA, Inc. Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and Never Back Down Communications director Erin Perrine join ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss how endorsements will benefit the respective De Santis and Trump campaigns. Texas Gov.Greg Abbott, a Republican, announced in a social media post on Sunday that he is ""proud to endorse"" former President Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination. ""Today, I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President,""Abbott said in a poston X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Now more than ever, America needs a President who will secure the border and prioritize national security. President Trump is the clear choice to get the job done."" The former president joined the governor in Edinburg, Texas on Sunday for Abbott’s annual pre-Thanksgiving tradition of serving tamales to Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and Texas National Guardsmen deployed along the southern border under the governor’s Operation Lone Star program. TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT TO ENDORSE TRUMP FOR 2024 GOP NOMINATION WHEN THEY TEAM UP SUNDAY NEAR US-MEXICO BORDER The visit is intended to spotlight the combustible issue of illegal immigration and border security. The border has been a major issue for Republican voters and GOP leaders and politicians for two and a half years, leading to harsh criticism of President Biden’s administration’s handling of the crisis and a surge in border crossings by migrants. Trump pledged to launch the largest mass deportation effort in American history if he is re-elected and would reinstate travel bans and his 2019 ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers aiming to enter the U.S. at the southern border to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their cases.

Greg Abbott and former President Donald Trump in 2021.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via AP, Pool) In 2021,Trump endorsed Abbott as the conservative governor who was seeking re-election and faced multiple primary challenges from the right. He overwhelmingly won the renomination in March 2022 before defeating his Democratic challenger, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke last November to secure a third term as governor. Abbott was grateful for Trump's early endorsement last cycle, according to those in the governor's political orbit, and he's now apparently returning the favor.

Remove yourself from the internet You might be surprised by just how much information about yourself is on the internet, such as your name, address, phone number, email, photos, social media accounts, and more. This information can be used by other people to find you, contact you, or even harm you. That's why you may seriously consider removing your information from the internet to protect your privacy and security. However, this is not an easy task, as there are hundreds of websites that collect and display your information, and they might not always let you delete it. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period. Check out my top picks for personal data removal services 8. Lock your photos Don’t allow someone to go snooping through your photos without your consent. Some of us have some vulnerable things in our photo albums that are not for anyone else’s eyes. For example, you might have photos of your family, your medical records, your travel documents, or your personal hobbies that you don’t want to share with strangers or even some of your friends. That’s why you can lock your photos on your smartphone so that no one else can access them. Here’s how to do it. How to lock your i Phone photos How to lock your Android photos Settings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer: 9. Avoid autofill Autofill is a feature that automatically fills in the search box or forms with the words or information that you have used before. For example, if you searched for ""best chocolate cake recipe"" on Google, the next time you type ""best"" in the search box, autofill will suggest ""best chocolate cake recipe"" as an option. This can be helpful if you want to search for the same thing again, but it can also reveal your previous searches to anyone who uses the same device. Although autofill is meant to help you search faster, it doesn’t always serve you best. 10. Be careful what you post One of the best ways to remain private online is to be cautious about what you post. The world doesn’t have to see every part of your life; you should keep certain things private. For example, you might not want to share your personal information, such as your full name, address, phone number, or email, with strangers or even some of your friends. You might also want to avoid posting photos or videos that show your location, your family, your belongings, or your activities. These things can be used by hackers, scammers, oridentity thievesto harm you or your loved ones. I understand the desire to post constantly or even just spend long periods scrolling through social media. However, limiting your social media use can help you focus on your priorities, improve your mood, andprotect your privacy. Here are the steps to do it. For i Phone: For Android: Settings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer: 11. Get an alias email address Another way to remain private is to use an alias email address to avoid being inundated with spam. Analias email addressis an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. You can always create an alias email and if you start getting spam sent to that alias email address, you can always delete that alias email and keep your inbox spam-free! Here’s how to set up an alias email address. In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications. For example, you can create different alias email addresses for different purposes, such as personal, work, family, hobbies, etc. You can also create filters and labels in your email app to sort and categorize your emails based on the alias email address they are sent to. This can help you manage your emails more efficiently and easily. See my review of best secure and private email services, including my #1 pick which includes unlimited, customized alias email addresses.

""Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate — we cannot hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

Argentinians have elected as their next president Javier Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist whose sensational rhetoric has drawn comparisons to former U.S.President Donald Trump. Partial election results showed Milei had 55.8% and Massa 44.2%, with 95% of the votes tallies. Should that margin hold, it would be wider than predicted by all polls and the widest since Argentina's returnto democracy in 1983. Presidential candidate of the Liberty Advances coalition Javier Milei raises his fist after voting in the presidential runoff election in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko) On the campaign trail, Milei, with his wild hair and inflammatory rhetoric, pledged economic shock therapy and to slash the size of the state. He’s also indicated he would move the Argentine embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem– paralleling another move by the Trump administration. Milei’s victory comes amid a nationwide wave of deep discontent and rising poverty. His opponent, Economy Minister Sergio Massa of the Peronist party, conceded defeat and congratulated Milei.

Massa also drew attention to his opponent's often aggressive rhetoric and openly questioned his mental acuity. PINK FLOYD'S ROGER WATERS DENIED HOTEL RESERVATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA AFTER ANTISEMITISM ACCUSATIONS Milei accused Massa and his allies of running a ""campaign of fear"" and he walked back some of his most controversial proposals, such as loosening gun control.

Belgium’s largest prison is reelingfrom a wild sex scandal that accused guards and staffers of organizing jacuzzi orgy parties and trading colorful bracelets to determine their sex partners, a local report detailed. Ten guards and staffers at the Lantin Prison, located near the city of Liège, have come under fire for allegedly hosting sex parties after work and even having intercourse with each other during their shifts at the prison, a report from Belgian news outlet Sudinfo reported. One of the staffers was even described as a ""nymphomaniac"" who would allegedly demand sex from co-workers at work. The employees allegedly held orgies after work hours, most frequently in a jacuzzi owned bya male guard onlyidentified as ""P."" During the parties, the staffers would allegedly determine which employee they would sleep with by drawing a colorful bracelet at random, the report said.

381,Fox News,Finland accuses Russia of flooding borders with Middle Eastern migrants in retaliation for cooperation with US,Stephen Sorace,". Finland has accused Russia of flooding its borders with migrants from the Middle East and Africa over its decision to increase defense cooperation with the United States, a claim which Moscow denies. As many as 300 migrants from Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and Syria have arrived in Finland this week, Reuters reported, citing the Finnish Border Guard.The arrivals have prompted Finland to erect barricades at the border with Russia to stop the migrants from crossing freely into the country. The razor-wire barriers were put up Friday around midnight at the Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala border posts in southeast Finland, border officials said. After two people breached the barriers and crossed into Finland, border authorities said the barriers would be improved so that similar crossings would be impossible.

382,Fox News,Iran-backed Houthi rebels accused of hijacking ship linked to Israeli billionaire in Red Sea,Danielle Wallace,"Samaritan’s Purse President Reverend Franklin Graham tells ‘FOX & Friends Weekend’ about being the first Evangelical leader to visit Israel since the war began and his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A cargo ship linked to an Israeli billionairewas allegedly seized by Iran-backed rebels in the Red Sea on Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’soffice said it ""strongly condemns the Iranian attack against an international vessel."" ""The ship, which is owned by a British company and is operated by a Japanese firm, was hijacked with Iran guidance by the Yemenite Houthi militia,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement. ""Onboard the vessel are 25 crew members of various nationalities, including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Filipino and Mexican. No Israelis are onboard. This is another act of Iranian terrorism and constitutes a leap forward in Iran's aggression against the citizens of the free world, with international consequences regarding the security of the global shipping lanes."" Israel Defense Forces also wrote on X, ""The hijacking of a cargo ship by the Houthis near Yemen in the southern Red Sea is a very grave incident of global consequence. The ship departed Turkey on its way to India, staffed by civilians of various nationalities, not including Israelis. It is not an Israeli ship."" While Israeli officials insisted the vessell was British-owned and Japanese-operated, ownership details for the Bahamian-flagged Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier, in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, which was founded by Abraham ""Rami"" Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel, according to The Associated Press. NETANYAHU WAR CABINET STIFLES REVOLT FROM FAR RIGHT OVER SENDING GAZANS FUEL WITHOUT HOSTAGE DEAL: REPORT Ungar told the AP he was aware of the incident but couldn’t comment as he awaited details. The Galaxy Leader is seen at the port of Koper, Slovenia, on Sept. 16, 2008.(AP Photo/Kristijan Bracun) The complex world of international shipping often involves a series of management companies, flags and owners stretching across the globe in a single vessel. There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel groupin Yemen that threatened earlier Sunday to target Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea. A spokesperson for the Houthi military in Yemen, Yahya Sarea, vowed on X earlier Sunday, ""In solidarity with Palestinian people in the wake of the brutal Israeli aggression on Gaza, Yemen reiterates the threat against Israeli vessels in the Red Sea."" Yemen's Houthi rebels seized the Israeli-linked cargo ship in a crucial Red Sea shipping route on Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, officials said.(AP Photo/Kristijan Bracun) ""The Yemeni Armed Forces announce that they will target all of the following types of ships: 1. Ships carrying the flag of the Zionist entity 2. Ships operated by Israeli companies 3. Ships owned by Israeli companies,"" he wrote. ""The Yemeni Armed Forces also calls on all countries of the world to: a. Withdrawal of its citizens working on the crews of these ships. B. Avoid shipping on or handling these vessels. C. Inform your ships to stay away from these ships."" Last month, Houthi rebels were suspected of sending missiles and drones over the crucial shipping lane of the sea.

Satellite tracking data from Marine Traffic.com analyzed by the AP showed the Galaxy Leader traveling in the Red Sea southwest of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, more than a day ago. The vessel had been in Korfez, Turkey, and was on its way to Pipavav, India, at the time of the seizure reported by Israel. It had its Automatic Identification System tracker, or AIS, switched off, the data showed. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS active for safety reasons, but crews will turn them off if it appears they might be targeted or to smuggle contraband, which there was no immediate evidence to suggest was the case with the Galaxy Leader. Yemenis chant slogans as they participate in a pro-Palestinian protest against the escalating Israeli military actions in Gaza on Nov. 18, 2023, in Sana'a, Yemen.(Mohammed Hamoud/Getty Images) The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which provides warnings to sailors in the Persian Gulf and the wider region, put the hijacking as having occurred some 90 miles off the coast of Yemen’s port city of Hodeida, near the coast of Eritrea. The Red Sea, stretching from Egypt’s Suez Canal to the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait separating the Arabian Peninsula from Africa, remains a key trade route for global shipping and energy supplies. That’s why the U.S. Navy has stationed multiple ships in the sea since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7. An American defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, told the AP that U.S. military officials were tracking an incident involving the Galaxy Leader after its alleged hijacking. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A ship linked to Ungar experienced an explosion in 2021 in the Gulf of Oman. Israeli media blamed it on Iran at the time. Since 2019, a series of ships have come under attack at sea as Iran began breaking all the limits of its tattered nuclear deal with world powers. As Israel expands its devastating campaign against Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip following the militant group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel, fears have grown that the military operations could escalate into a wider regional conflict. The Houthis have repeatedly threatened to target Israeli ships in the waters off Yemen. Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

384,Fox News,"Christians in China survive persecution, but here’s what their oppressors don’t know",David Curry,"Katherine Swidan and Harrison Li unveiled their message to President Biden during 'FOX & Friends First' ahead of his meeting with Xi Jinping in San Francisco. A recent Pew Research Reportmeasuring religion in Chinasuggests that Christianity in the country has stagnated and is perhaps even in decline. But to borrow from Mark Twain, such suggestions seem greatly exaggerated. In fact, many of us who are advocating for persecuted Christians globally believe the Christian community in China might even be growing. If you believe Pew Research’s latest report, about 23.3 million adults in Chinaself-identified as Christian in 2010.That number fell to 19.9 million by 2018. That’s a decline of nearly 3.5 million Christians in less than a decade. It’s a stunningly high figure that may even seem plausible to those of us who have followed the multi-faceted anti-Christian campaign waged by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during this period. China believes it is winning the war against Christianity and this Pew Research report gives the CCP hope. BIDEN AGAIN CALLS XI JINPING A 'DICTATOR' AS CHINA VOWS TO BE 'UNSTOPPABLE' IN RETAKING TAIWAN According to our own internal research at Global Christian Relief, Pew’s number could be off by as much as 100 million, but no one truly knows the size. What China is actually doing is pushing the church underground, forcing believers to self-censor in an environment that has onlyworsened under President Xi Jinping. Restrictions against religious worship have increased since Xi Jinping became president. FILE: Chinese President Xi waves at an event to introduce new members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 23, 2022.(AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) It’s important to recognize that Pew’s report analyzes data from a range of sources, including data collected and compiled by the Chinese government itself. For this reason, we might be cautious about whether this data is fully trustworthy. After all, the CCP has attempted to squelch Christianity and religious belief in the name of Marxism for years, and the government has a spotty record when it comes to honestly disclosing uncomfortable facts about religious life within its borders. All this information matters because the survey data is based on self-censorship. The data is based on what respondents are willing to admit, but Chinese Christians know they can be persecuted for their responses. So, Christians in China have plenty of incentives not to disclose their true identities. Which is perhaps why Pew openly admits the possibility that there may be ""limitations in survey and government data,"" and claims ""some analyses make adjustments"" to account for these issues. There are other significant facts that give us reason for pause, too. Christians in China tend to cluster in various regions and villages and aren’t evenly distributed geographically. If some of the most Christian cities like Wenzhou have been excluded from the survey, for example, that would have a noticeable impact on the data. While Pew acknowledges not every region in the country may have been proportionately sampled, it certainly gives us reason to be cautious of drawing sweeping conclusions. The methodology used by the Chinese government to count the number of Christians between 1949 and 2018 has changed much over time, making it difficult to compare more recent statistics with earlier numbers gathered decades ago. For instance, the government has not specifically stated whether children are included in the total numbers of Christians. It’s also unclear whether the changes in numbers are driven by new converts or a recategorization that includes Christians who previously worshiped in unregistered churches. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has enacted restrictions against the free practice of the Christian faith within its borders. These restrictions have only increased since Xi became president and the de facto leader of the CCP. The CCP actively promotes atheism, claiming that religion is only a temporary societal phenomenon that will disappear over time. Fear of government retaliation makes it unclear if Christianity is actually declining in China. FILE: Choir sings during a rehearsal for performance to mark the Chinese new year at a countryside church on February 21, 2007, in Luoyang of Henan Province, China.(Photo by China Photos/Getty Images) Watchdog groups and religious freedom advocacy organizations like Global Christian Relief, which I lead, continue to report that Christian communities are surging in many areas of China, but they often remain underground. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The government has tightened control of Christian activities outside registered venues, banned foreigners from spreading church content online, and cracked down on house churches. You can bet that the Christians who exist in these covert communities are not being counted in government surveys. Given the hostile anti-Christian environment in China, why would Chinese citizens feel safe sharing their honest thoughts and beliefs about religion?  According to the analysts within Global Christian Relief, and our many contacts on the ground in China, only about one in five people are self-reporting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Considering everything we know about the situation in China and the data on which Pew is relying, we can only conclude that we do not have an accurate picture of the true size and scope of the Christian community in China. At best, we might say that after decades of rapid growth, Christianity’s growth in China may be slowing. It’s easy to believe the latest bleak reports, which make for great headline fodder. But the truth is, those of us who want to see a growing, thriving Christian presence in China do not have compelling reasons to despair and perhaps even have reasons to rejoice.

385,Fox News,I’m a pro-life nun and we just stopped the state of New York from harassing us,"Sr. Maris Stella, S.V.",". If I have learned anything over my years of working with pregnant women, I have learned that when a woman knows she’s loved, supported and believed in, she can do anything. So, this past week, when New York gave up its efforts to interfere with our confidential services to women, we rejoiced at the victory. I am a member of the Sisters of Life, a Catholic community of religious womenfounded by Cardinal O’Connor in 1991, who devote themselves to God by professing vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. We also take a fourth vow: to protect the sacredness of human life. Over the past 30 years, we have poured countless cups of tea as we have listened to the stories of the women who have knocked on our doors. Each year at our Visitation Mission in New York,we receive the hopes and fears of hundreds of pregnant women who find themselves overwhelmed by their unexpected pregnancies. 'MARCH FOR LIFE' REVEALS THEME FOR 2024 EVENT IN POST-ROE UNITED STATES Each woman’s story is unique, and yet we constantly hear the fear of being alone, the pain of abandonment by those closest to her, and the worry that if she has this baby, her life is over. It can be very disorienting. This is a time when she needs support the most. The Sisters of Life order was targeted by a 2022 New York law investigating pro-life pregnancy centers.(Sisters of Life) We have long offered women free housing, clothes, diapers and other supplies before and after they give birth. We connect women and their children to free medical, legal and social services. We ensure that vulnerable children have access to daycare and special needs resources. We help women with spiritual support, counseling, school applications, job training and budgeting. Everything we do is for love of the woman who seeks our help and is aimed at attending to her physical, spiritual and emotional needs. We have also made it a priority to accompany women who are seeking hope and healing after their experience of abortion. It’s our privilege to walk alongside each woman who comes to us and to stand in solidarity with her, helping her to move in freedom, not in fear. But in June 2022, the state of New York passed a law targeting our ministry. That law allows government officials to look through theinternal documents of pro-life pregnancy centers,including information about the women they serve. Our Visitation Mission is a place where women can feel safe with the knowledge that their histories, hopes and fears are kept confidential. Many are in search of a refuge from physically and/or sexually abusive partners. Turning over information about these women and their conversations with us would only jeopardize our relationships of trust with women who come to us for help. Last fall, with the help of our attorneys, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, we asked a federal court to uphold our ability to care for expectant mothers in need. We asked for a court order forbidding New York from demanding our information or punishing us for refusing to provide it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Although this law was enacted with much publicity, the government was disinterested in defending it. Over the past year, the case did not move forward, because the state repeatedly delayed the case rather than defend it. The federal judge recently gave the order we wanted, forbidding New York from demanding our information or punishing us for not providing it. And the state ended up agreeing not to enforce its law against us — rather than having to defend that law in court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge’s order will protect us as we continue our ministry. As Sisters of Life captivated by the truth of the beauty of every person, created in God’s image, we believe that each life has deep meaning and worth. In every woman that walks through our doors, we see the unique goodness and beauty that may be hidden to her in her time of need. By our presence, love and support we say to her, ""We believe in you. You are worth fighting for."" In fact, we give our lives for that truth. And we are grateful for this victory, which protects our right to continue to uphold and defend the beauty and strength of women. Sr. Maris Stella, S.V., is vicar general of the Sisters of Life.

The writer was complaining about dog feces left on the sidewalks, but he sure didn’t write ""feces."" I grew up in a home where such words were never used. Seeing an obscenity in print was shocking. How young and naïve I was. BIDEN REPORTEDLY FUMES AND SPEWS CURSES AT STAFF IN PRIVATE: ‘NO ONE IS SAFE’ My dad took me to a hockey game around 1970. The crowd expressed its extreme displeasure with the opposing team, chanting that they did something vacuum cleaners and suction cups did. I didn’t know what they were talking about, and my father wouldn’t explain it. It took a few more years before I got clued in. Then came George Carlin’s ""7 Dirty Words""routine, which gave an intellectual patina to the public use of vulgarity. Next, the Nixon tapes, filled with infinite [expletive deleted]’s, bracing the nation with the revelation of locker room language in the Oval Office. How shocked we were to discover that all the president’s men had potty mouths. George Carlin's famous ""7 Dirty Words"" routine gave an intellectual patina to the public use of vulgarity.(Kevin Statham/Redferns) Then came the great Red Sox-Yankees rivalryof the mid to late 1970s, replete with chants of ""Yankees suck!"" (And, in the Bronx, ""Boston blows!"") Traditionalists were appalled. Young people were delighted with the public naughtiness of it all. In the 1980s, comedy clubs, late night TV, hip-hop and cable removed whatever objections people had to ""bad words.""  And then came Howard Stern on satellite radio, and then the Internet and social media, and the wheels came off, once and for all. PROFESSOR HURLS STUDENTS' PRO-LIFE DISPLAY AFTER PROFANITY-LACED TIRADE: ‘TRIGGERING MY STUDENTS’ As profanity rises, subtlety vanishes. Back in the day, limits actually enhanced creativity and even comedy. The owner of the all-woman band in the 1959 Billy Wilder classic ""Some Like It Hot"" has to watch her language, as did everyone else back then. She hilariously tells the band manager, ""Every girl in my band is a virtuoso, and I intend to keep it that way!"" How shocked we were to discover that all the president’s men had potty mouths. (AP Photo) ""Obscene"" derives from the ancient Greek prefix ""ob-"" or off and the word ""skene,"" which means stage, from which we take the word ""scene."" Anything that the Greeks wouldn’t put on a stage was considered ob-skene, or obscene. Today, there are no standards, on stage or off. These days, in fact, the world is awash in bad language. The former president notoriously referred tocertain ""s---hole countries"" in Africa. A recent Politico.com article quoted one British politician describing others as ""f---wads,"" which does have a certain British ring to it. Even some business books are replete with swear words; it’s hard to tell whether the authors are struggling to appearau courantor whether they’re just clueless about how offensive they will be to broad swaths of readers. As president, Donald Trump referred to certain ""s---hole countries"" in Africa.(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) It used to be a sign of ill breeding touse profanity in public.No longer. Expletives were always part of the workplace conversation, but they were confined, in gentler times, to moments when women were not in earshot, and used only with people one already knew. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These days, I’m always surprised when total strangers – business prospects or others, men or women – drop f-bombs at first meetings. Don’t they realize that someone might be offended? Or am I the last person on earth to care? Women of my mother’s generation never used coarse language. Today, gender makes no difference when it comes to four-letter words or gerunds derived therefrom. Decades ago, swearing was associated with sailors, not with college-educated women. Of course, back then, only sailors had tattoos, too. It appears that there is no turning back; that profanity, out of the mouths of men, women and babes, is irrevocably part of our daily discourse. The world is the worse for our boorishness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Are there more pressing problems than the fact that expletives are no longer deleted? That we, and our children, are subject not just to Carlin’s 7 dirty words but also to others that even Nixon might not have used? Yes, but if you want my opinion, it’s still a f---ing shame.

The report also highlighted variances in cancer death rates across different races and ethnicities. In 2021, the cancer mortality rate among White children and teens was 16% less than for Black and Hispanic groups. More advanced chemotherapy treatments likely contributed to the declining mortality, said one physician.(i Stock) Between the years 2001 and 2021, cancer deaths declined 27% for White children and teens, compared to an 11% drop for Black youth and 19% among young Hispanic patients, according to the CDC.

IN POTENTIAL CANCER BREAKTHROUGH, NEWLY FOUND ‘KILL SWITCH’ TRIGGERS DEATH OF CANCER CELLS: ‘ONE-TWO PUNCH' Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Centerand a Fox News medical contributor, said that a combination of factors likely contributed to the declining mortality rates.

Brooklyn College sociology professor Alex Vitale was one of multiple professors and researchers whodiscussed with CNNgrowing concerns over the rise in retail theft as more stores have closed or moved out of large cities. However, Vitale insisted that the concern is usually overblown. ""Historically, shoplifting has always had this outsized impact on public discourse,"" Vitale said. He added, ""We see examples on video of behaving badly and it gets invested with all this extra meaning about the collapse of social order."" Shoplifters in Washington D.C. were caught on video stealing laundry detergent in the middle of the day.(Fox News) ORGANIZED SHOPLIFTING IS A $100-BILLION PROBLEM. HERE'S WHY WE'RE ALL SCREWED The report by CNN contextualized ""anxiety over shoplifting"" as ""an enduring phenomenon"" that ""is often a stand-in for larger concerns of cultural, economic or political changes"" from concerns over ""bored and sexually repressed"" women in the 1800’s to teens and college students in the 1960s. ""In the 1960s, there was more of a political and cultural element to shoplifting,"" Michael Flamm, a historian from Ohio Wesleyan, said. ""There was a much wider articulation that shoplifting was a critique of the capitalist system."" Flamm added, ""Shoplifting tied into a wider sense that respect for authority was diminishing. It was a stand-in for larger concerns and anxieties."" The National Retail Federation (NRF)found that retails across the nation lost $112.1 billion in revenue due to theft in 2022 with Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City being among the most affected cities. In addition, major store brands such as Target and Walmart have shuttered multiple stores, citing retail crime and annual losses as a factor. A viral video showed freezers at a San Francisco Walgreens chained shut after workers complained of rampant theft.(Richie Greenberg @greenbergnation) Although the article also found that shoplifting reports in 24 major cities were 16% higher in the first half of 2023 compared to 2019, it cited a report from the Council on Criminal Justice that ""there is no clear national rise in shoplifting."" TARGET SHUTTERS STORES, CONSUMERS AFFECTED AS MAJOR COMPANIES GRAPPLE WITH MASSIVE THEFT LOSSES The piece further added that the shoplifting issue has been used politically to push back against police and criminal justice reforms. ""Shoplifting has also become a politically charged crime that many on the right and some Democrats have exploited to oppose criminal justice policy reforms,"" the article stated. James Walsh, who directs the University of Ontario Institute of Technology’s graduate program on criminology and justice, added, ""The figure of a shoplifter may provide for a scapegoat for deeper problems that are more complex and intractable… It resonates with broader concerns about law and disorder.""

In my new book, ""The Constitution of the United States and Other Patriotic Documents,"" readers can rediscover what made America a luminous beacon of hope for liberty, prosperity, and justice throughout the world. Since before its founding, our country has been blessed with extraordinary leaders who steeledour resolve for independence. They invented a new form of government by the people and for the people. Each brought different skills and talents to the cause of freedom. Those who followed guided us ably through more than two centuries of often treacherous challenges and grave threats. It is a story best told through thelens of historic documentsthat have been honored and preserved for our national heritage. In this unique collector’s edition, the writings, speeches, and letters of our founders and their successors are carefully selected and explained. The important promises and navigating principles that shaped our great nation can be read in full. Over time, others helped transform public sentiment to advance equality and opportunity, empowering generations that followed. Their eloquent beliefs and convictions are also included. NEW STUDY FINDS AMERICAN HISTORY COLLEGE COURSES AMPLIFY DIVISIVE MOMENTS WHILE IGNORING POSITIVE ACTIONS The American experiment had its genesis in the power of words and ideas. We owe our unparalleled success to the exemplary statesmen – and women – who expressed them. Bold and transcendent figures defined what it is to be an American and to control our own destinies. Their dynamic opinions, steadfast faith, and inspiring arguments are revisited in this volume as a salute to our nation’s enduring triumph. The durability of our constitutional republic and the rights we enjoy today also serve as a shining testimonial to the moral courage and intellectual brilliance of our forebearers. We are their grateful beneficiaries. Absorbing their wisdom enriches our appreciation for the lives we enjoy and our love of country. Among the essential patriotic documents contained in the book, we revisit seminal moments in the American journey.  For example… *As Patrick Henrystirred the nation with his passionate vow, ""Give me liberty or give me death,"" it was the inexorable logic and ""common sense"" of Thomas Paine that galvanized Americans to declare their independence when he wrote, ""Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never forsaken us."" *John Adamscautioned that only the ballot box in a representative democracy would prevent men in power from becoming ""ravenous beasts of prey."" He argued that ""The happiness of society is the end (goal) of government."" *While Ben Franklinexpressed sober misgivings aboutthe Constitution,Alexander Hamilton and James Madisonpenned a brilliant set of essays known as The Federalist Papers that led to its adoption.

Abraham Lincoln(Library of Congress Prints and Photographs) *As the suffrage movement gained momentum,Elizabeth Cady Stantoncondemned the tyranny of sexism, leaving ""women to feel aggrieved, oppressed, and deprived of their most sacred rights."" Victoria C. Woodhull correctly argued that ""the Constitution makes no distinction of sex"" and ""women are the equals of men."" In a much acclaimed speech, Susan B. Anthony, who was indicted for casting a ballot, posed the vexing question, ""Is it a crime for a citizen of the United States to vote?"" *At the dawn of the 20th century,Theodore Rooseveltshattered the Gilded Age of ruthless monopolists and robber barons with his promise of a ""square deal for every man, big or small, rich or poor."" Drawing from the principles of Lincoln, Roosevelt moved aggressively and successfully against corporate corruption and what he called ""the sinister influence or control of special interests"" in government. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States(The Associated Press) *His relative,Franklin Roosevelt, saw the nation through immense suffering in the Great Depression by reassuring Americans, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" His innovative fireside chats buoyed the spirits of a nation in despair. When the U.S. was attacked by Japan on Dec. 7, 1941, Roosevelt delivered his famous ""a date which will live in infamy"" address before Congress.

Veterans Day is observed on Nov. 11 each year. The federal holiday is a day when Americans pay their respects and thank themillions of veteranswho have served in the U.S. armed forces. Veterans Day became a federal holiday in 1954. GEORGE W. BUSH DURING WARRIOR BIKE RIDE IN TEXAS FOR AMERICA'S VETERANS: ‘LUCKY TO HAVE THEM AS CITIZENS’ In October of that same year, President Eisenhower issued the first ""Veterans Day Proclamation."" Below are nine numbers-based facts surrounding Veterans Day. Veterans Day is a federal holiday celebrating all those who have served in the armed forces.(i Stock) Before there was a Veterans Day, there was an Armistice Day. President Wilson proclaimed Nov. 11 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day in 1919, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The date of Armistice Day reportedly referenced the day World War I ended with the signing of an armistice on the Western Front on Nov. 11, 1918 at 11 a.m. VETERANS DAY AND ITS HISTORY: 6 KEY FACTS TO KNOW On the first Armistice Day, Wilson said, ""To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations."" The United States Army is a land service branch of the U.S. armed forces.(i Stock) Armistice Day waschanged to Veterans Dayby President Eisenhower in 1954, according to the Library of Congress. The switch to Veterans Day was reportedly done to honor veterans of all U.S. wars. Veterans Day is one of the 11 federal holidays recognizedby the U.S. government. It is the ninth federal holiday observed in a calendar year, according to a list published by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Human Resources Management. There are 16.5 million veterans in the United States.(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) The other federal holidays are New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Washington’s Birthday,Memorial Day,Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In 2021, there were 16.5 million veterans in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Of those, there were 1.7 million female veterans, according to the source. VETERANS DAY VS MEMORIAL DAY: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? The final permanent exhibit of the National WWII Museum in New Orleans was finished and introduced to the public on November 3, 2023. On this day, 44 WWII Veterans attended the event to see the final pavilion dedicated to their sacrifices. Some 1.3 millionactive-duty service membersmake up the U.S. armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and Space Force), according to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Federal Register, an official journal of the federal government. In order to become an active duty service member, you need to graduate from high school or receive a GED, take a placement exam, a physical exam and enter into basic training. The alternative to joining a branch of the U.S. military is to earn a college degree from one of the five military academies. VETERANS DAY IS NOT ALWAYS EASY FOR OUR HEROES – HERE'S WHAT TO SAY AND DO The academies include the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) or West Pointin West Point, New York; the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) in Annapolis, Maryland; the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) in Colorado Springs, Colorado; the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) in New London, Connecticut; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in Kings Point, New York. The Department of Defense has 825,000 National Guard and Reserve service members who can be called on in case of emergency. The National Guard is stationed all across the United States, and territories, making it easy for military personnel to remain close to home while serving. There are over 2,000 National Guard units stationed in nearly 3,000 communities. As for the Army Reserve, reservists are also typically stationed near their homes. Soldiers can serve in the Air Force Reserve, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve. Part-time National Guard and Reserve soldiers do not live on base. The Pentagon's U.S. Space Forceis the newest branch of the U.S. military and was established 2019. Upon organization, the Space Force's intention was to stand up three squadrons in Delta 7, a threat analysis squadron, a targeting squadron and a PED squadron. The purposes of each squadron vary, but each captures diverse forms of intel from potential threats. The Coast Guard is the branch of the military that acts under the Navy during times of war. The Coast Guard was established in 1790, but the Navy was not established until 1798, making the guard eight years older. The Coast Guard is the only military branch that is part of the Department of Homeland Security. One of the guard's responsibility is search and rescue missions, such as in the case of themissing Titanic submarine in 2023. Service members typically serve a full eight years before retiring from the guard. Veterans Day is celebrated on Nov. 11 each year.(i Stock) The U.S. Census Bureau indicates there are 8.1 million veterans who are over the age of 65. This makes up nearly half of all veterans throughout the country. Though there are still many living veterans from World War II, the service members from the second war are aged 90 and over. Some have already celebrated 100th birthdays. WWII veteran and German POW, Wally King,born in rural Ohio, was shot down over Germany in April 1945 just as the war was ending. He turned 100 on Oct. 31, 2023. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER ""I got hit by a light ground fire somewhere near the Russian front between the two armies and the plane caught on fire, which caused me to bail out,"" he told Fox News Digital in mid-October. Of the 16.1 million Americans who served in World War II, there are 119,550 veterans alive today, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. U.S. WWII Veterans are still making waves in the news, too. In May 2023, Fred Taylor, a 101-year-old veteran walked at a college graduation ceremony 80 years after he graduated to finally receive his diploma. ""I have no regrets about going into the service,"" he told Fox News Digital at the time. ""I really enjoyed flying. My only regret is missing my graduation ceremony, as you normally would end your senior year."" And WWII Veteran Gladys Hughespreviously told Fox News Digital via email, ""When someone says to me, ‘Thank you for your service,’ I want to shout out to them, ‘Thank you for caring!’"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are three U.S. states that are home to over one million veterans: Texas, Florida and California. In Texas, there are over 1.4 million veterans andin Florida, there are over 1.3 million.There are also over 1.3 million veterans living in California, but over 10,000 fewer than in Florida.

Josh Allen threw three touchdown passes and the sluggish Buffalo Billsoffense responded to a change in coordinators by scoring points on six of its first eight possessions in a 32-6 rout of the AFC East-rival New York Jets on Sunday. The Bills (6-5) snapped a two-game skid and topped 25 points for the first time in seven weeks to end the team’s worst drought since a six-game run during Allen’s rookie season in 2018. After building a 9-0 lead on three field goals by Tyler Bass, Allen broke the game open with three touchdowns over four possessions spanning halftime. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Jets (4-6) dropped their third straight and coach Robert Saleh potentially opened the door for a quarterback switch. Starter Zach Wilsonwas benched with 2:17 remaining in the third quarter and replaced by Tim Boyle, who didn’t fair much better in overseeing an offense that managed to score just its ninth touchdown of the season. Allen was efficient in finishing 20 of 32 for 275 yards with an interception, which came on a desperation Hail Mary to end the first half. Otherwise, he put the game on ice with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Ty Johnson on fourth-and-1 to cap Buffalo’s opening drive of the third quarter. He followed that up four minutes later with an 81-yard touchdown to Khalil Shakir in putting the Bills up 29-6. Buffalo Bills running back James Cook, top center, celebrates a touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game against the New York Jets in Orchard Park, N.Y., Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) The 81-yard touchdown was the longest scoring play from scrimmage this season, and the offensive outburst came with quarterbacks coach Joe Brady taking over as coordinator after Ken Dorsey was fired on Tuesday following a 24-22 loss to Denver. Newly acquired cornerback Rasul Douglas had two interceptions — Buffalo's first in seven games — and also recovered a fumble. The offensively challenged Jets finally scored a touchdown, but nothing much else went well for a team that ranks at or near the bottom of the league in numerous offensive categories. LIONS PUT TOGETHER 4TH-QUARTER COMEBACK TO STUN BEARS IN NFC NORTH BATTLE Wilson’s 9-yard touchdown pass to Breece Hall with 45 seconds left in the first half was the Jets’ first TD in three weeks. And the Jets needed a trick play to extend their touchdown drive with punter Thomas Morstead completing an 18-yard pass to cornerback Brandin Echols on fourth-and-2 from New York’s 24. Wilson finished seven of 15 for 81 yards with an interception. Boyle was 7 of 14 for 33 yards and an interception. Buffalo’s offense by comparison showed signs of rhythm, balance and imagination, which were all issues that became apparent under Dorsey. Most important, the offense’s ability to build and maintain an early lead took the pressure off an injury depleted defense already missing three key starters, and lost three defensive backs to head injuries during the game. The most serious injury was sustained by safety Taylor Rapp, who moved his hands as he was loaded into an ambulance on the field. Rapp sustained a neck injury, while Taron Johnson and Dane Jackson were ruled out with head injuries.

Have you ever sent atext messageto someone and wondered if they have read it or not? Maybe you are waiting for a reply, or maybe you just want to make sure they got your message. Whatever the reason, it can be frustrating to not know if your message has been seen or ignored. Fortunately, there is a way to find out if someone has read your text message, and it is called, ""read receipts."" Read receipts are notificationsthat tell you when the recipient of your message has opened and read it. They can also show you the time when they read it, so you can have a better idea of their availability and interest.

Pros:Turning on read receipts lets you know when the other person has seen your message, which can be useful for confirming important information or avoiding misunderstandings. You can also customize read receipts for individual contacts, so you can choose who can see when you read their messages and who can’t. Cons:Turning on read receipts can also have some drawbacks, such as invading your privacy or putting pressure on you to reply quickly. Some people might get annoyed or offended if they see that you have read their message but haven’t responded yet. You might also lose the option to pretend that you didn’t see a message that you don’t want to deal with.

Instead, you will have to use SMS messaging, which is the standard text messaging service that works over cellular networks. SMS messages are shown in green bubbles on your i Phone. The problem with SMS messaging is that it does not support read receipts. This means that you will not be able to see if the recipient has read your message or not. You will only see a status of Delivered,which means that your message has reached their phone, but not necessarily that they have opened it. The only way to get read receipts for SMS messages is to use a third-party app that supports them, such as Whats App, Facebook Messenger or Signal. These apps work over Wi-Fi or cellular data, and they allow you to see when the recipient has read your message, as well as other features like voice and video calls, stickers, and encryption.

""A Christmas Story,""which started as a low-budget film that had a modest showing at the box office in 1983, is now an undisputed holiday classic and a must-watch for many families each season. The movie premiered in theaters 40 years ago – on Nov. 18, 1983 – and while at first it seemed like a forgettable piece of nostalgia, the 1940s coming-of-age story soon became a holiday staple through TV viewings and video rentals. Here is what the original cast is up to now. Let's see if Ralphie ever shot his eye out and if Randy was ever able to put his arms down. I triple-dog dare you to read on.

Mc Gavin, who had entered his 60s by the time he played the part, already had a successful career behind him that began in 1945 with ""A Song to Remember."" He starred in several TV series, including ""Crime Photographer,"" ""Riverboat,"" ""Mike Hammer."" ""The Outsiders"" and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker.""

""And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it he was indignant, and said to them, ‘Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.’ And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands upon them"" (Mark 10:13-16). These verses come from the Gospel of Mark, one of the three synoptic Gospels. The Gospel of Mark is attributed to St. Mark the Evangelist.

429,Fox News,Virgin Mary statue reportedly crying in Mexico town sparks questions about potential miracle,Christine Rousselle,"An abbey in rural Gower, Missouri, has become a pilgrimage site due to the body of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster A statue of the Virgin Mary in the Mexican state of Colima that is reportedly weeping tears has drawn crowds of onlookers and questions about a potential miracle. The statue was first noticed ""crying"" in October — but videos of the statue's purported tears gained traction on social media in mid-November. The statue, which is encased in glass, is named the Virgin of Dolores. It's located in the town of El Chanal, which is near the city of Colima, the capital of the state with the same name. VIRGIN MARY STATUE WITHSTANDS EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY AS CATHEDRAL COLLAPSES: 'INSPIRING SYMBOL OF HOPE' ""Dolores"" translates to ""sorrow"" or pain."" In Catholicism, one of the titles of the Virgin Mary is Our Lady of Sorrows, inspired by a prophecy in the Gospel of Luke. A statue of the Virgin Mary located in the Mexican state of Colima is reportedly crying tears. Here are two views of the statue.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) ""So, a couple of tears started flowing,"" eyewitness Víctor Ramos told the news outlet CEN. Thestatue's eyes reddenedas she ""cried,"" claimed Ramos. ""Similarly, when we cry, and our eyes become red, the same happens to the image,"" Ramos said. WHAT ARE ANGEL NUMBERS AND WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SEEING THEM? Perhaps the statue's tears were a reaction to the ""violence rates that are being experienced here in the state of Colima, also here in the community,"" said Ramos. The U.S. Department of State is right now warning against traveling to the entire state of Colima due to ""crime and kidnapping."" In 2022, thecity of Colimahad a homicide rate of 181.94 homicides per 100,000 residents, said Mexico's Citizens’ Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice. This was the highest in the world. Videos of the statue's tears have gone viral on social media platforms.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) Ever since videos of the supposedly crying statue went viral on social media platforms, the church has experienced a slew of visitors hoping to see the crying statue for themselves. Two Catholic priests told Fox News Digital that they were hesitant to endorse any devotion to the supposedly miraculous occurrence. ""Often, there's a natural explanation for these sorts of things."" ""These phenomena have to be subject to thejudgment of the Church, which usually comes from the local bishop after an investigation and hearing experts on the matter,"" said Fr. Thomas Petri, O.P., president of the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, DC. ""Often, there's a natural explanation for these sorts of things,"" he said. But even after an investigation by Church authorities in which no natural reason is found, ""Catholics are not obliged to believe in these phenomena,"" said Petri. AS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH ""However, we can always be grateful for any event or occurrence that causes people to pause and think about God and heavenly realities,"" he added. Fr. Paul Hedman, a priest of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and a self-described ""skeptic"" on these types of phenomena, also urged caution. ""People should remain indifferent and not get too excited until the Church is able to investigate,"" he said. Some people have suggested that the statue of the Virgin Mary is crying due to the slew of violence in the city near where the statue is located.(CEN/Licensed for Fox News Digital) A crying statue, said Hedman, could be caused by something such as condensation, or ""outright fraud by those looking to make a buck."" ""I would generally encourage people to maintain a healthy skepticism — the truth will come forward, and it is better to be cautious than to pour your soul into something that turns out to be inauthentic,"" he said.

433,Fox News,"Voting begins in Argentina’s presidential runoff, may send Trump-admiring populist Milei into presidency",Associated Press,". Voters in Argentina were heading to the polls Sunday in a presidential runoff election that will determine whether South America’ssecond-largest economy will take a rightward shift. Populist Javier Milei, an upstart candidate who got his start as a television talking head, has frequently been compared to former U.S. President Donald Trump. He faces Economy Minister Sergio Massa of the Peronist party, which has been a leading force in Argentine politics for decades. On Massa's watch, inflation has soared to more than 140% and poverty has increased. Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist, proposes to slash the size of the state and rein in inflation, while Massa has warned people about the negative impacts of such policies. The highly polarizing election is forcing many to decide which of the two they consider to be the least bad option. ARGENTINA'S JAVIER MILEI COPIES TRUMP'S PLAYBOOK TO BECOME COUNTRY'S BIGGEST PRIMARY ELECTION VOTE-GETTER ""Whatever happens in this election will be incredible,"" said Lucas Romero, director of local political consultancy Synopsis. ""It would be incredible for Massa to win in this economic context or for Milei to win facing a candidate as professional as Massa."" Voting stations opened at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) and close 10 hours later. Voting is conducted with paper ballots, making the count unpredictable, but initial results were expected around three hours after polls close. Milei went from blasting the country’s ""political caste"" on TV to winning a lawmaker seat two years ago. The economist's screeds resonated widely with Argentines angered by their struggle to make ends meet, particularly young men. Javier Milei, left, is running against Economy Minister Sergio Massa, right, in Argentina’s presidential election. Argentines headed to the polls Sunday in the highly polarizing runoff election.(AP Photo/File) ""Money covers less and less each day. I’m a qualified individual, and my salary isn’t enough for anything,"" Esteban Medina, a 26-year-old physical therapist from Ezeiza, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a Milei rally earlier this week. Massa, as one of the most prominent figures in a deeply unpopular administration, was once seen as having little chance of victory. But he managed to mobilize the networks of his Peronist party and clinched a decisive first-place finish in the first round of voting. His campaign has cautioned Argentines that his libertarian opponent's plan to eliminate key ministries and otherwise sharply curtail the state would threaten public services, including health and education, and welfare programs many rely on. Massa has also drawn attention to his opponent's often aggressive rhetoric and has openly questioned his mental acuity; ahead of the first round, Milei sometimes carried a revving chainsaw at rallies. FORMER ROCKER NICKNAMED 'ARGENTINE TRUMP' GAINS ELECTION STEAM WITH ANTI-SOCIALIST MESSAGE Massa's ""only chance to winthis electionwhen people want change ... is to make this election a referendum on whether Milei is fit to be president or not,"" said Ana Iparraguirre, partner at pollster GBAO Strategies. Milei has accused Massa and his allies of running a ""campaign of fear"" and he has walked back some of his most controversial proposals, such as loosening gun control. In his final campaign ad, Milei looks at the camera and assures voters he has no plans to privatize education or health care. Most pre-election polls, which have been notoriously wrong at every step of this year’s campaign, show a statistical tie between the two candidates. Voters for first-round candidates who didn’t make the runoff will be key. Patricia Bullrich, who placed third, has endorsed Milei. Javier Rojas, a 36-year-old pediatrician who voted for Bullrich in October, told The Associated Press he's leaning toward Milei, then added: ""Well, to be honest, it’s more of a vote against the other side than anything else."" Underscoring the bitter division this campaign has brought to the fore, Milei received both jeers and cheers on Friday night at the legendary Colón Theater in Buenos Aires. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The vote takes place amid Milei's allegations of possible electoral fraud, reminiscent of those from Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Without providing evidence, Milei claimed that the first round of the presidential election was plagued by irregularities that affected the result. Experts say such irregularities cannot swing an election, and that his assertions are partly aimed at firing up his base and motivating his supporters to become monitors of voting stations. Such claims spread widely on social media and, at Milei’s rally in Ezeiza earlier this week, all those interviewed told the AP they were concerned about the integrity of the vote. ""You don’t need to show statistically significant errors,"" Fernanda Buril, of the Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems, said in an e-mail. ""If you draw enough attention to one problem in one polling station which likely doesn’t affect the results in any meaningful way, people are likely to overestimate the frequency and impact of that and other problems in the elections more generally.""

434,Fox News,European country wants to charge 'green tax' on all flights to fund pensions: report,Michael Lee,"Captain Dennis Tajer joined FOX & Friends First to discuss the alarming discovery and what is being done to ensure the safety of airline passengers. Denmark is considering a new law that wouldtax all flightsin an effort to boost the country's sustainable energy goals, but not all the money raised would be used for green energy. The new proposal would tax passengers about $9 for flightswithin Europe,$25 for medium distance flights, and $56 for long-distance flights, according to a report from the Washington Post. The new tax is expected to raise about 1.2 billion krones, or roughly $176 million, and would be used to fund a transition to having all Danish domestic flights use sustainable fuels by 2030. Another portion of the funds raised would go toward paying pension increases to elderly Danes, according to the report.

""The flight sector in Denmark must – as all other sectors – lower its carbon footprint and get on board a green future. We will create that change and make green flights our reality."" The policy would be phased in over time, the report notes, starting in 2025 and with the goal of a complete transition by 2030. The country also plans to have its domestic flight route powered byall-green-fuelsin the skies by 2025.

CRISIS AVERTED...FOR NOW: PILOT REVEALS WHY PLANES BARELY AVOIDING TRAGEDY AS TERRIFIED PASSENGERS SPEAK OUT ""This proposal is little more than greenwash that will ultimately fuel the industry’s growth. The tax is too tiny for demand reduction, and most of it will be swallowed by the industry,"" Magdalena Heuwieser, co-founder of the Stay Grounded network, told the Washington Post. Instead, Heuwieser believes that Denmark should ban all domestic flights and promote the country'srail system.

437,Fox News,Simplify your Thanksgiving spread with these 1-pan side dish delights,"Perri Ormont Blumberg , Maeghan Dolph , Gabriele Regalbuto","'FOX & Friends First' co-host Carley Shimkus reacts to Martha Stewart claiming to be 'Turkeyed out' and presents the official FOX News cookbook on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Thanksgiving Day,a time for warmth, grateful hearts and delicious feasting, would not be the same without flavorful food. Sure, the main event at the dining room table is usually the big bird, but side dishes are just as important. They are the unsung heroes stealing the spotlight, adding layers of taste and texture to complement the star of the table. Preparing a Thanksgiving feastoften involves a symphony of pots, pans and utensils, with the kitchen turned into a bustling hub of culinary activity. Yet after the whirlwind of cooking, the aftermath of a cluttered kitchen can be daunting. Cleaning multiple dishes, utensils and cookware can feel like an uninvited task, stealing precious post-dinner relaxation and family time. THANKSGIVING QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW FACTS ABOUT THE ANNUAL TURKEY DAY HOLIDAY? Picture this: one single pan on the stovetop, transforming simple ingredients into masterpieces, while keeping the chaos of a cluttered kitchen at bay. Does it get better? After you've cleaned the house and shopped relentlessly in preparation for guests, the convenience of the minimal cleanup becomes a relief. Here are three Thanksgiving side dishes guaranteed to make your feast unforgettable. Disclaimer: These recipes are meant to be cooked together on one large cookie sheet, all baked in the oven at 425 F. However,the sweet potatoeswill take more than double the time the veggies need to cook, so you will need to begin cooking them first. Once the potatoes are cooked halfway, follow these recipes, add the Brussels sprouts and carrots to the same cookie sheet — and bake through. Sweet potatoes offer a delightful blend of sweetness and comfort that embodies the essence of the holiday feast.(i Stock) Begin by washing your potatoes with soap and warm water to remove any dirt. From there, you can either peel or keep the skin on the potatoes. Using a sharp knife, cut the potatoes into slices. You’ll want them less than ½ inch thick. Coat the potatoes in olive oil and toss with chopped fresh sage and minced garlic. THANKSGIVING MEALS WILL YIELD PLENTY OF LEFTOVERS, SO HOW DO YOU STORE THEM SAFELY? Add everything to a cookie sheet and salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 20–25 minutes at 425 F and then flip the potatoes before adding the vegetables to bake with them. Once youadd the Brussels sproutsand glazed the carrots, bake the potatoes for another 25 minutes, remove and top with crushed pecans and serve hot. When roasted Brussel sprouts are kissed by the heat of the oven, their outer layers are left caramelized to golden perfection, developing a delightful crunch while the inner layers retain a tender, creamy texture.(Natasha Breen/REDA&CO/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) While the potatoes are cooking for the first half of their bake, prepare the Brussels sprouts by removing the stems. Toss the vegetable with melted butter, fresh lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. HOW FAST CAN YOU FIND A PUMPKIN HIDDEN IN A GROUP OF TURKEYS? Cut the shallots into round slices and toss with the sprouts. Gently add the veggies next to the sweet potatoes and, once the glazed carrots are added, bake for 25 minutes at 425 F. When the sheet of sides is fully cooked, remove the pan and transfer the food onto serving platters. Sprinkle the pomegranate seeds atop the Brussels and serve hot. What makes glazed carrots a standout side dish is their simplicity. A drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of salt, and a dash of herbs or spices are all they need to shine.(Gabrielle Geiselman) For this carrot recipe, wash and peel the outside of the carrots to remove any dirt or stems. Slice the carrots at an angle about half an inch thick and toss them in melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin, fresh chopped parsley and salt and pepper to taste.

441,Fox News,Thanksgiving travel faces challenges from budding cross-country storm,FOX Weather,"Millions of Americans across the country are gearing up for Thanksgivingtravelthis week, but a powerful storm system impacting more than 30 states in the central and eastern U.S.will bring a variety of weather impacts, such assevere weatheralong the Gulf Coast and rain and snow in the Northeastand New England. THANKSGIVING TRAVEL WEATHER LIVE TRACKER: CURRENT RADAR, AIRPORT STATUS, FLIGHT DELAYS AND MORE FALL IS THE SECOND SEVERE WEATHER SEASON So, if you were planning on traveling ahead of the holiday in the East – buckle up. It’s going to be a bumpy ride. Here’s a breakdown of each day’s forecast: The FOX Forecast Center says more widespread rain is expected across much of the Eastern U.S. on Tuesday, which will have more of an impact on Thanksgiving travel in other major cities. As this system moves into the Ohio Valley, another system from Canadawill dive to the south, providing more fuel for the ongoing storm. This will allow forsnowto break out in the Great Lakes, with mostly rain falling elsewhere. Snow could also fall in the Northeast and in New England, but that will be limited to only the highest elevations. Meanwhile, the severe weather threat will expand on Tuesday to include more of the Southeast as well as into themid-Atlantic. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF A WHITE THANKSGIVING? The SPC placed a large area from southeastern Mississippito the Carolinas in a Level 1 out of 5 on its thunderstorm risk scale. However, there is an area of southern Alabamaand the Florida Panhandle which is at a Level 2 out of 5. There is also a threat of tornadoes, which includes cities with major airports like Atlantaand Charlotte. THANKSGIVING DINNER MAY COST A BIT MORE THANKS TO EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS ACROSS THE U.S. A secondary area of low pressure is likely to form along the East Coast near the Jersey Shore as the main system slides off the coast on Wednesday. This new low pressure system will likely enhance the wind impacts for coastal regions as it works its way up the coast before it moves out to sea. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES RECORD THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY TRAVEL SEASON Heavy rain is expected for most of the Interstate 95 corridor on Wednesday morning but will begin to wind down by the time we get into Wednesday afternoon. Impacts could linger a bit longer for cities along the coast like Bostonand areas of Maineas the storm scrapes the coast, but the worst of the weather should wrap up by Wednesday evening. The FOX Forecast Center says snow is possible in upstate New York,Vermont,New Hampshireand Maine on Wednesday. That snow will be falling ahead of the heavy rain, so the FOX Forecast Center expects there won’t be much accumulation due to the rain expected after. Most of the country will be clear of major weather impacts on Thanksgiving, and the only hotspot where rain could put a damper on festivities will be in East Texas, Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast.

442,Fox News,Severe storms bring strong tornado threat to Gulf Coast during busy Thanksgiving travel week,FOX Weather,"A strong storm system has the potential for tornadoes and the threat of damaging wind gusts overnight as severe weather continues to push east. Severe storms were ongoing throughout portions of the Gulf Coast states. Doppler radar confirmedtornadoesin Vernon and Rapides Parishes in Louisiana. A possible tornado damaged structures and downed trees in Colfax, Louisiana. Parts of Louisiana reported golf ball-sized hail Monday evening. Listen to the cacophony. This Ferriday, Louisiana took refuge in his garage just as golf ball-sized hail pelted his car and front yard. A dangerous nocturnal threat exists as the storms continue pushing east through Mississippi and Alabama during the overnight hours. In this region, the tornado probabilities are the highest, which warranted the severe weather threat risk rising from a 2 to a 3 on the SPC's scale. ""A big heads up for Louisiana and Mississippi, especially because some of the threat is going to be while we are sleeping,"" says FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin. ""So if you have already done your Thanksgivingtravel plans over the weekend, you’re setting up shop for the week (and, say) you’re in Mississippi, but you’re not from Mississippi,download the FOX Weather app."" ""(There) is significant risk to property,"" she added. ""But if you don’t protect your body, it can also be a deadly risk. These are going to be large, long-track tornadoes that are possible."" (FOX Weather) CROSS-COUNTRY STORM COULD BRING THANKSGIVING TRAVEL TROUBLE Most of thesevere weatheringredients are in place for seeing tornadoes. The relatively low amount of available storm energy could be the ingredient limiting the severity of thunderstorms, but it will still be enough with the abundant moisture and wind shear in place to keep things active for most of Monday into early Tuesday around that area. FALL IS THE SECOND SEVERE WEATHER SEASON The storms along the cold front will be moving fast, and damagingwindwith gusts of 60 mph or greater will be an additional concern. This line of storms will work its way through all of Louisiana and a majority of Mississippi on Monday night before finally running out of steam. Secondary impacts will be heavy rainfall on roadways such as Interstate 55, I-20 and I-10, which may impact anyone traveling on the roads, as well as some major airport hubs. The rainfall forecast between Monday, Nov. 20, and Thursday, Nov. 23, 2023. (FOX Weather) There is a lingering severe threat along the Gulf Coast come Tuesday morning, but the widespread severe threat will likely come to an end shortly after midnight on Monday. Severe weather outlook for Nov. 21, 2023. (FOX Weather) Still, the SPC has highlighted an area in southern Alabama and the western edge of the Florida Panhandle in the Level 2 risk for severe weather for early Tuesday morning and then amarginal (1 out of 5) riskof severe weather on Tuesday across a wide swath of the Southeast. Thunderstorms capable of producing damaging winds and possibly a tornado will move across the region Tuesday morning. Strong thunderstorms are possible in Mobile, Montgomery and Panama City.

444,Fox News,Eagles-Chiefs preview: This could be a downfall during Monday Night Football matchup in Kansas City,FOX Weather,"In what’s expected to be a highly-viewed matchup Monday between the Eagles and the Chiefs, a certain visitor may cause some problems during the game. No, we aren’t talking about the meeting of Travis Kelce’s and Taylor Swift’s parents, but rain looks to be imminent for Monday Night Football at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadiumin Kansas City. In what’s being dubbed as the ‘Family Reunion Game,’ both Travis Kelce’s Kansas Chiefs and brother Jason Kelce’s Philadelphia Eagles are coming off bye weeks ahead of the Monday night contest. KELCE FAMILY ADVOCATES FOR NFL STADIUMS TO USE GRASS FIELDS AFTER TURF INJURY The last time the Eagles and Chiefs met, the Chiefs went home with the Lombardi Trophy and were crowned as Super Bowl LVIIchampions, so expectations for this game will be another nail-biter with a likely close score. Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs reacts at the line of scrimmage against the Philadelphia Eagles during the fourth quarter in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium on February 12, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. ((Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)) The Eagles are 8-1 on the season, and the Chiefs have a 7-2 record. Both teams are sure to put up points, but the question remains of how the weather will impact the game and what effect it will have on quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts. ARTIFICIAL TURF VS. REAL GRASS: NFL'S ONGOING PROBLEM WITH PLAYING SURFACES Jalen Hurts #1 of the Philadelphia Eagles scores a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium on February 12, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. ( (Photo by Focus on Sport/Getty Images)) When deciding between players whom you equally like to start in your fantasy football lineup, weather can be the ultimate tiebreaker. With imminent rain andwindsgusting upwards of 25 mph, the passing game could be affected. WHY IS ARROWHEAD IN KANSAS CITY THE LOUDEST NFL STADIUM? No matter the weather, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is a must-start, along with Mahomes. But if rain impacts the game, Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco, a top-25 fantasy running back this season, will probably be the Chiefs offensive player you want in your lineup. Jalen Hurts #1 of the Philadelphia Eagles gets set against the Kansas City Chiefs after Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium on February 12, 2023 in Glendale, Arizona. The Chiefs defeated the Eagles 38-35. ((Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images)) As far as the Philadelphia Eagles are concerned, Jalen Hurts is a no-brainer. If you are concerned about the passing game, running back Deandre Swift will be a must-start. Swift averages 4.5 yards per carry, is a tremendous check-down option, and is a top-20 fantasy running back this season. WHICH NFL TEAMS DO BEST IN THE COLD? Eagles’ AJ Brown will be someone to watch, especially with the ongoing rain showers. Brown already has over 1,000 receiving yards this season through nine games, nearly doubling Travis Kelce’s numbers, and is a top-5 fantasy receiver in 2023. And let’s not forget the Chiefs and Eagles defenses this season. Both are among the top defenses in the NFL. This game will definitely be interesting to watch, whether it’ll be a shootout or a low-scoring affair. FILE –  Storm blowing over Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs, before a game against the San Diego Chargers on December 14, 2008 in Kansas City, Missouri. ((Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)) Bring your ponchos and dress warm if you are headed to the roofless Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night, as rain will be ongoing in Kansas Cityfor the 7:15 p.m. kickoff. WEATHER EXTREMES THAT WILL IMPACT NFL GAMES IN 2023-24 SEASON Alow-pressure system that will bring severe weather to the Southeastwill also bring rain to the central Plains. Rain will be in the forecast for most of the day on Monday, withstormchances lowering as nightfall approaches. Rain chances look to end near the time the game finishes. Windswill be out of the north, ushering in colder temperatures to accompany the rain. Winds will continue to get strong throughout the game, gusting at 25 mph. Temperatures will hover in the low 40s for kickoff and remain somewhat steady throughout the game. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or

445,Fox News,Meet the everyday heroes commemorated at FOX Nation's 2023 Patriot Awards,Madeline Coggins,"General contractor Tony Siravo spoke with 'FOX & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones about how it has been 'truly an honor' to create the pieces of art for this year's Patriot Award recipients. Country music's biggest stage was dressed in red, white and blue and theseats were filledwith some of the nation's top patriots for FOX Nation's 2023 Patriot Awards. The fifth annual award show was held at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tenn., Thursday night, and the event brimmed with pride and patriotism. Six honorees who have gone above and beyond in the name of patriotism were honored at the event. Here is a look atthis year's awardrecipients: MOST VALUABLE PATRIOT - TIFFANY JUSTICE & TINA DESCOVICH Parental rights in education has become a hot topic in politics following the coronavirus pandemic and a motivating issue in elections across local, state and federal levels. As more parents engage public spaces to protect their children, one group that has spearheaded efforts across the nation is Moms for Liberty(M4L), whose founders Tiffany Justice and Tina Descovich were awarded the ""Most Valuable Patriot Award."" Rachel Campos-Duffy and Sean Duffy presented the award to Justice and Descovich who proved their dedication to protecting parental rights in America through their work with M4L. ""We are accepting this on behalf of over 130,000 moms and dads across America, and to our moms in just under three years, over 300 chapters, 48 states, we know you are working to unify, educate and empower parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government,"" Justice said after receiving the award Thursday. NEW PATRIOT AWARD HONORS FALLEN HERO, TROPHIES CUSTOM-MADE BY THIRD-GENERATION CARPENTER ""We are joyful warriors. Our children are being taught to hate each other in school. There is no future for America with that type of hate, so we are going to fight like hell with a smile on our faces because our children are watching us, and it is a privilege to fight for this country."" Moms for Libertywas founded two years ago amid the coronavirus pandemic as a ""social-welfare"" nonprofit group, which means it can engage in political and policy activity without disclosing its donors. The group says its mission is to protect parental rights in education, which they describe as ""God-given and fundamental."" ""Once we let the government get in between us and our children, our families are done. Our country is at risk. This is the line in the sand. Moms for Liberty, moms across the country have drawn that line because we do not co-parent with the government,"" Descovich added. BACK THE BLUE AWARD - JAMES PATTERSON Bestselling author James Patterson was awarded the ""Back the Blue Award"" for his dedication to defending men and women in law enforcement and sharing their stories that otherwise go unheard. FOX News contributor Tyrus and ""Crime Cam 24/7"" Sean ""Sticks"" Larkin presented the award to the ""Walk the Blue Line"" author. ""Walk the Blue Line"" is a collection of honest and heartfelt stories by realpolice officersrevealing what it's like to wear the uniform. Patterson, however, has written about crime and law enforcement for years. WATCH: FLORIDA POLICE OFFICERS LIFE CAR OFF MAN TRAPPED UNDERNEATH - ‘SOMEBODY PULL HIM OUT!’ ""I've been writing about the police for years. From Alex Cross to the nonfiction ‘Walk the Blue Line,’ what I've heard from officers over and over is thanks for telling our side of the story. Part of that story is that there's no such thing as a routine call for help. There are no routine car stops. Every call can be a matter of life and death,"" Patterson said after accepting his award. The ""Alex Cross"" author emphasized the importance of backing the men and women in blue. ""We need to back our men and women in blue. If we don't, we could end up with a country of cities overrun by criminals, and it's kind of happening already. We need to make sure our police are supported by this rule of law. Bad guys: You do the crime, you do the time,"" he added. ""I'm proud to be up here standing in for all these officers and to behonoring our policetonight. Go blue."" SALUTE TO SERVICE - WORLD WAR II VETERAN ANDY NEGRA Nearly eight decades ago, Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy and marked the beginning of the end of World War II. Veteran Andy Negra was one of the men in the momentous battle, and was honored with the ""Salute to Service Patriot Award."" Award-winning actor Dennis Quaid and FOX News' Johnny ""Joey"" Jones presented Negra with the custom trophy crafted by third-generation carpenter Tony Siravo. ""I represent all of the World War II veterans that are still alive, and for the other veterans out of the other wars, let me assure you, I represent you, too. That's the Iraq and all the rest of them,"" Negra said upon receiving his award. WITH AMERICAN PATRIOTISM IN STEEP DECLINE, VETERANS DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF HONORING THOSE WHO'VE SERVED ""I graduated high school. Two weeks later, I was heading for Fort Bragg, N.C., and after that, it was history. I learned real quick what service to the country meant. I learned new jobs I never knew work. I learned how to rely on my friends. I relied on everything around me to protect me."" The 99-year-old commemorated the 79th anniversary of D-Day this past June at the beaches in Normandy along with more than 40 other veterans. Negra told AP he is the last member of the 128th Armored Field Artillery still living. ""[The world is] a mess. I never thought that we fought so hardduring World War IIto find the country in a condition that it is today, but let me assure you, let me assure all of you — every time this country ever got into a problem, they solved it, so regardless of what's going on now, we will break this badness and get back to the good,"" he said. YOUNG PATRIOT - PRESTON SHARP In 2015, a 12-year-old Preston Sharp was first inspired to serve and honor America's veterans. After visiting his grandfather's grave, he was shocked by the lack of flags and flowers placed at the graves of other veterans and decided to take matters into his own hands. Sharp's commitment to America's veterans earned him the ""Young Patriot Award,"" presented by FOX News' Harris Faulkner and Will Cain. ""[This award] is to bringawareness to our veterans, to remind them that they matter, that we do care, and that they will always be remembered,"" Sharp said. Since 2015, Sharp's nonprofit Veterans Flags and Flowers has expanded and grown beyond ensuring a veteran is honored in death. FOX WEATHER AWARD FOR COURAGE - TRACY HARDEN While winds gushed and sirens blared warnings throughout the area, a quick-thinking restaurant owner in Mississippi saved herself and eight others by sheltering in the dairy cooler. As an EF-4tornadotore the building down around her, Tracy Harden managed to save lives in her community despite the danger around her. Co-hosts of ""The Five"" along with FOX Weather's Janice Dean awarded Harden the ""Courage Award"" for her heroic actions. ""I know that night there was a much higher power holding me steady, allowing me to push through. For that, I'm grateful,"" Harden said, holding back tears.

Twenty-five people were killed in Mississippi and one in Alabama by several tornadoes in March 2023. Harden's actions saved her own and eight other souls. ""I want to accept this award in memory of the 14 lives, 14 friends we lost during the tornado,"" she added. ""Not for myself, but for my community. We are Rolling Fork strong, we are Rolling Fork rising, and I am so proud."" T2T STEPHEN SILLER AWARD - NASHVILLE POLICE ""FOX & Friends"" co-hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, Brian Kilmeade and Lawrence Jones were joined by Frank Siller to present the first-ever T2T Stephen Siller award. The award is named in honor of firefighter Stephen Siller, who died in the9/11 terrorist attacks. Frank was joined by his nephew, Stephen Siller, in presenting the award to the Nashville police. Stephen Siller was only a baby when his father rushed to the scene at the Twin Towers over 20 years ago. While there are countless stories of law enforcement going above and beyond in the line of duty, police earlier this year rushed toward gunshots after an active shooter opened fire on a church-run school in Nashville, Tenn. Five law enforcement officers from Nashville were awarded the ""T2T Stephen Siller Award"" for their response to the Covenant School Shootingin March. ""That decision was — it wasn't a decision. It was what was going to happen,"" Det. Sgt. Jeff Mathes said on behalf of the other officers. CLICK HERE TO JOIN FOX NATION Police responded after shooter Audrey Elizabeth Hale began shooting at students and teachers at the Covenant Schoolearly on March 27. The killer gunned down three 9-year-olds and three adults and left a community reeling in the aftermath of the massacre. Law enforcement saved countless lives after rushing into the line of fire, and before 10:30 a.m. had fatally shot the killer on the second floor of the school building. ""I've been thinking about what the term or the word patriot means since I found out about this, and the only thing, I can't think of a definition, but I can think of people from times all the way across our history as a nation,"" Mathes continued. ""On behalf of the Metro Nashville Police Department, there are patriots that I'll accept this for, but patriots like our friend and detective on our team, Eric Wegner. He ran outside and was the stimulus of getting shot. He got shot at, and that's what we needed to find what we needed and the work that we needed to do. So being a patriot is going for others, respecting each other, respecting your country and most importantly, putting your God first."" The five Nashville police were honored further and memorialized in a portrait by American painter Steve Penley.

446,Fox News,Popular children's book is returned to Missouri library after 30 years: 'Never too late',Christine Rousselle,". A library in Missouri is celebrating the return of its oldest-ever overdue book — and thanks to its no-fine policy, the person who checked it out and who has now returned it does not owe a cent. ""It's never too late to come back to the library, especially now that we are fine-free,"" the St. Charles City-County Library in St. Peters, Missouri, shared in a Nov. 8 Facebook post. ""A customer returnedthis Sandra Boynton bookto our Wing Haven Branch today,"" the post read — noting that the book was checked out back in 1993. NEW YORK LIBRARY RECEIVES AN OVERDUE BOOK NEARLY 90 YEARS LATER And while library staff appeared to be glad the book had been returned, they were ""even [happier] to welcome the customer back to the library,"" according to the post. The book, ""But Not the Hippopotamus,"" by Sandra Boynton, was published in 1982. The book, ""But Not the Hippopotamus"" by Sandra Boynton, was returned to the St. Charles City-County Library in Missouri after more than 30 years.(St. Charles City-County Library) It's recommended for children ages 1-3 years old, according to an Amazon listing. Boynton has ""written and illustrated over 75 children's books and seven general audience books,"" according to her biography on book publisher Simon & Schuster's website. Five of Boynton's books have been New York Times bestsellers. She's sold 85 million books. ""Kids' books like that always get lost in the weirdest places."" Facebook users reacted to the announcement of the book's return, with some people tagging Boynton's account. ""And the kid [that] this was read to is all grown up now,"" said one Facebook user. LIBRARY RECEIVES OVERDUE BOOK FROM 47 YEARS AGO, ALONG WITH ANONYMOUS NOTE AND A SURPRISE ""Must bea tough read.Congrats on finishing it!"" another user joked. Another person was sympathetic to the person who returned the long-overdue book, saying, ""Kids' bookslike that always get lost in the weirdest places."" A representative from the St. Charles City-County Library told Fox News Digital that the Boynton book is the oldest in ""recent memory"" that's been returned to the library district.

In addition to books, the St. Charles City-County Library also lends out DVDs, CDs, e Resources, magazines and a ""library of things,"" such as cake pans and Wi Fi hotspots, the representative said. NEW JERSEY MAN RETURNS BORROWED BOOK TO HIS LIBRARY 75 YEARS LATE The library systemhas not charged fines since September 2020, a move that also cleared any existing fines on customer accounts. Library customers will, however, be responsible for replacing the cost of an item if it is not returned after 28 days. A spokesperson from the library in St. Peters, Missouri (not pictured), told Fox News Digital that the Sandra Boynton children's book was the oldest book returned to its shelves in recent memory.(In Pictures Ltd./Corbis via Getty Images) The decision to eliminate fines was made after research showed that the threat of fines was deterring people from using the library, the St. Charles City-County Library wrote in a news release in 2020, when it announced it would be going fine-free. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER ""While researching the idea of offering a fine-free library to the community, we discovered that although fines do not represent a significant portion of the library’s overall budget, they do act as a significant deterrent for those most in need of a library,"" Jason Kuhl, CEO of the library, said in the release. Even though the book was overdue by 30 years, the library patron was not charged a fine for the late book — as the library system in Missouri eliminated fines back in 2020.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Library fines, he said, disproportionately affect children,older adults,disabled and homebound customers, and lower-income households."" ""The library is committed to serving all customers, whatever their age or economic status,"" said Kuhl. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other library systems that have eliminated fines have seen an increase in the number of new library cards issued as well as an increase in the number of checked out items, said Kuhl. What these systems have not seen, he said, was an increase in the number oflost or missing items. ""We anticipate that we will have fewer lost items because customers who were afraid to return a late item will now be able to do so without financial consequences,"" he added.

A study found that people were more energized when they were tasked with keeping a positive secret.(i Stock) The experiment found good news that was being kept a secret was more ""energizing"" than good news that wasnota secret — leading people to want to keep the good news to themselves, according to Slepian. Previous research on secrecy had suggested that keeping secrets is bad for our well-being, he said, as BBC Science Focus reported. ""But this work has only examined keeping secrets that have negative implications for our lives."" Summing up the new findings, Slepian told Fox News Digital, ""Rather thanbeing fatigued and burdenedby the secret, people find positive secrets energizing."" SECRETS FROM FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FOR BETTER, SMOOTHER AIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCES THIS FALL Slepian also found that ""positive secret keeping"" was motivated by ""intrinsic reasons other than [the] secrets"" themselves. It was ""autonomous choice"" — as opposed to ""choice based in external pressures,"" the study stated. Slepian said this is due to the anticipation about the secret being revealed eventually. Thousands of people took part in experiments to see how they felt about keeping secrets big and small.(i Stock) Most of the positive secrets that ""people intend to reveal and anticipate the revelation [of] are exciting and energizing,"" Slepian said. The most surprising finding of the study, he added, was that even when positive secrets aren’t intended to be revealed — people still get excited about them.

(AP) — A second person was arrested Thursday in a Tampa, Florida, mass shooting that erupted during Halloween festivities, leaving two dead and 16 injured, police said. A 14-year-old boy was arrested in Palm Beach Countyand was waiting to be transported back to Tampa, police said in a news release. He faces felony charges of being a minor in possession of a firearm while wearing a mask and carrying a concealed firearm. FLORIDA SHOOTING LEAVES AT LEAST 2 DEAD, 18 INJURED DURING HALLOWEEN CELEBRATIONS ""There is no reasonable explanation for a 14-year-old to be in possession of a firearm,"" Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said in a statement. An argument between two groups led to the shooting in the early morning hours of Oct. 29 in Tampa's Ybor City area, police said. Later that day, detectives arrested Tyrell Stephen Phillips, 22, in connection with the shooting. He was charged with second-degree murder with a firearm. A second suspect has been arrested in a shooting that rocked Ybor City, Tampa.(Fox News) The early morning fight occurred in an area with several bars and clubs that was once the center of Tampa’scigar industry. In more recent years, the area has been known for its lively nightlife, and Tampa police have said hundreds of people were on the streets at the time of the shootings because numerous nightspots had just closed. Video posted online shows people, many in Halloween costumes, drinking and talking on the street when about a dozen shots ring out, followed seconds later by about eight more. A stampede ensued, with some people toppling over metal tables and taking cover behind them. Video from the aftermath shows police officers treating several people lying wounded on the ground.

453,Fox News,Missouri's voter ID law is back in court. Here's a look at what it does,Associated Press,". COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — A trial for a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Missouri's new photo identification requirement for voters is scheduled to begin Friday. Here is a look at the function of the law and why voting rights groups are suing: WHAT THE LAW DOESMissouri's GOP-led Legislature last year capped off a nearly two-decade-long push by Republicans and passed a law requiring voters to show photo identification to cast a regular ballot. WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR VOTER ID AND MAKING EARLY VOTING EASIER: NATIONAL POLL People without a government-issued photo ID can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures. The law requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote. LEGAL CHALLENGESThe Missouri League of Women Voters,NAACPand two voters sued to overturn the law last year, arguing the change makes casting ballots unconstitutionally difficult for some voters. Cole County Presiding Judge Jon Beetem, who also will hear arguments in the trial beginning Friday, dismissed the case in October 2022. He found neither of the two voters ""alleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement."" The League of Women Voters and NAACP are challenging a MO law that requires photo ID in order to vote. The Missouri ACLUand Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, have since added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE LAWThe newest plaintiff is John O’Connor, a 90-year-old Columbia, Missouri, resident with poor vision who needs help walking. When the law took effect last year, O'Connor had an expired passport and driver's license, which are not acceptable forms of identification to vote under state law. His lawyers argued he eventually obtained a non-driver's license with the help of his wife, but only because officials accepted his expired driver's license despite guidance from the state Revenue Department that long-expired licenses are not acceptable records to use when seeking new IDs. ""Even when a voter obtains the underlying documentation, voters who lack transportation, cannot get to the DMV or other government agencies during their hours of operation, or have a disability or impairment that prevents them from accessing a DMV, the voter is still unable to surmount the burdens to obtaining a photo ID,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote in a pretrial brief. ARGUMENTS FOR THE LAWRepublican Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office is defending the law in court. The state lawyers argue that, so far, no one has been turned away at the polls because of the law. Missouri provides free non-driver's licenses for voting to those who do not already have a driver's license or have a current license. The health department's Bureau of Vital Records provides free birth certificates to those seeking their first non-driver's license in order to vote if the applicant does not have a current driver's license. ""There is not a severe burden on the right to vote as the State has gone to great lengths to help voters obtain IDs,"" Bailey wrote in a court brief. VOTER ID ELSEWHEREThe National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 20 ask for a photo ID. Other Republican-led states are moving in the same direction as Missouri as they respond to conservative voters unsettled by unfounded claims of widespread fraud and persistent conspiracy theories over the accuracy of U.S. elections. Critics characterize such requirements as an overreaction that could disenfranchise eligible voters. For the first time this year, Ohio voters were required show photo identification to cast ballots in person. The new law eliminated previously acceptable non-photo options, such as a utility bill, bank statement, government check or paycheck. State-issued photo IDs are available free of charge Missouri Republicans are not the only ones who had to fight for years to enact ID requirements. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP North Carolina’s voter photo identification law, enacted nearly five years ago by the Republican-controlled legislature but blocked by litigation, is just now being implemented. Registered voters there can get free IDs at their county election offices if they provide their name, date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number. Nebraska lawmakers this summer passed a voter ID law allowing a wide array of photo identification that voters can present at the polls. IDs include passports, driver’s licenses, military and tribal IDs and Nebraska college IDs. Expired IDs are allowed if they have the voter’s name and photo. Residents of hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living centers will be able to use patient documents that include a photo.

455,Guardian,"The great carbon divide Richest 1% account for more carbon emissions than poorest 66%, report says‘Polluter elite’ are plundering the planet to point of destruction, says Oxfam after comprehensive study of climate inequality2h ago'Obscene'Twelve billionaires’ climate emissions outpollute 2.1m homes, analysis finds'So undemocratic'Elon Musk was once an environmental hero: is he still a rare green billionaire?UKTax corporate polluters and rich to help tackle climate crisis, Jeremy Hunt told",Jonathan Watts,"The richest 1% of humanity is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest 66%, with dire consequences for vulnerable communities and global efforts to tackle the climate emergency, a report says. The most comprehensive study of global climate inequality ever undertaken shows that this elite group, made up of 77 million people including billionaires, millionaires and those paid more than US$140,000 (£112,500) a year, accounted for 16% of all CO2emissions in 2019 – enough to cause more than a million excess deaths due to heat, according to the report. For the past six months, the Guardian has worked with Oxfam, the Stockholm Environment Instituteand other experts on an exclusive basis to produce a special investigation, The Great Carbon Divide. It explores the causes and consequences of carbon inequality and the disproportionate impact of super-rich individuals, who have been termed “the polluter elite”. Climate justice will be high on the agenda of this month’s UN Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates. The Oxfam reportshows that while the wealthiest 1% tend to live climate-insulated, air-conditioned lives, their emissions – 5.9bn tonnes of CO2in 2019 – are responsible for immense suffering. Using a “mortality cost” formula – used by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others – of 226 excess deaths worldwide for every million tonnes of carbon, the report calculates that the emissions from the 1% alone would be enough to cause the heat-related deaths of 1.3 million people over the coming decades. Over the period from 1990 to 2019, the accumulated emissions of the 1% were equivalent to wiping out last year’s harvests of EU corn, US wheat, Bangladeshi rice and Chinese soya beans. The suffering falls disproportionately upon people living in poverty, marginalised ethnic communities, migrants and women and girls, who live and work outside or in homes vulnerable to extreme weather, according to the research. These groups are less likely to have savings, insurance or social protection, which leaves them more economically, as well as physically, at risk from floods, drought, heatwaves and forest fires. The UN saysdeveloping countries account for 91% of deaths related to extreme weather. The report finds that it would take about 1,500 years for someone in the bottom 99% to produce as much carbon as the richest billionaires do in a year. “The super-rich are plundering and polluting the planet to the point of destruction and it is those who can least afford it who are paying the highest price,” said Chiara Liguori, Oxfam’s senior climate justice policy adviser. The twin crises of climate and inequality were “fuelling one another”, she said. The wealth gap between nations only partly explains the disparity. The report shows that in 2019 – the most recent year for which there is comprehensive data – high-income countries (mostly in the global north) were responsible for 40% of global consumption-based CO2emissions, while the contribution from low-income countries (mostly in the global south) was a negligible 0.4%. Africa, which is home to about one in six of the world population, was responsible for just 4% of emissions. A less discussed but faster-growing problem is inequality within countries. Billionaires are still overwhelmingly white, male and based in the US and Europe, but members of this influential class of super-rich can increasingly be found in other parts of the world. Millionaires are even more dispersed. The report says this is bad news for the climate on multiple levels. The extravagant carbon footprint of the 0.1% – from superyachts, private jets and mansions to space flights and doomsday bunkers – is 77 times higher than the upper level needed for global warming to peak at 1.5C. The corporate shares of many super-rich arehighly polluting. This elite also wield enormous and growing political power by owning media organisations and social networks, hiring advertising and PR agencies and lobbyists, and mixing socially with senior politicians, who are also often members of the richest 1%, according to the report. In the US, for example, one in four members of Congress reportedly own stocks in fossil fuel companies, worth a total of between$33m and $93m. The report says this helps to explain why global emissions continue to rise, and why governments in the global north provided $1.8tn to subsidise the fossil fuel industry in 2020, contrary to their international pledges to phase out carbon emissions. Oxfam is calling for hefty wealth taxes on the super-rich and windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies to support the worst affected, reduce inequality and fund a transition to renewable energy. It says a 60% tax on the incomes of the wealthiest 1% would raise $6.4tn a year and could cut emissions by 695m tonnes, which is more than the 2019 footprint of the UK. Oxfam International’s interim executive director, Amitabh Behar, said: “Not taxing wealth allows the richest to rob from us, ruin our planet and renege on democracy. Taxing extreme wealth transforms our chances to tackle both inequality and the climate crisis. These are trillions of dollars at stake to invest in dynamic 21st-century green governments, but also to re-inject into our democracies.”",Unknown,,,
456,Guardian,Argentina presidential election Far-right libertarian Javier Milei wins after rival concedes Victory for TV celebrity-turned politician catapults South America’s second-largest economy into an unpredictable future2h ago,Tom Phillips,"Javier Milei, avolatile far-right libertarianwho has vowed to “exterminate” inflation and take a chainsaw to the state, has been elected president of Argentina, catapulting South America’s second largest economy into an unpredictable and potentially turbulent future. With more than 99% of votes counted, the Mick Jagger impersonating TV celebrity-turned politician, who is often compared to Donald Trump, had secured 55.69% of the vote compared with 44.3% for his rival, the centre-left finance minister Sergio Massa. “Today the reconstruction of Argentinabegins. Today is a historic night for Argentina,” Milei told jubilant supporters at his campaign headquarters in Buenos Aires, calling his victory a “miracle”. Milei promised “drastic changes” to tackle Argentina’s “tragic reality” of soaring inflation and widespread poverty. He also sent a message to the international community: “Argentina will return to the place in the world which it should never have lost.” Earlier, Massa - who received 11.5m votes to Milei’s 14.4m - conceded defeat. “Argentinians have chosen another path,” said Massa, who said he had called Milei to congratulate him on his victory and hinted he would retire from frontline politics. “Obviously these are not the results we hoped for and I have spoken to Javier Mileito congratulate him because he’s the president that the majority of Argentines have chosen for the next four years,” added Massa, whose Peronist movement has governed for 16 of the last 20 years. Pro-Milei activists rejoiced at the triumph of their 53-year-old leader, whom they describe as an economic visionary poised to lead Argentina out of one of the country’s worst economic crises in decades. “[I’m] happy, happy, happy,” said Francisco Jiménez, a 30-year-old delivery driver and Milei activist from Villa Soldati, a working-class area outside Buenos Aires. As he set off to join the party at Milei’s campaign HQ, Jiménez said he knew the result was likely to send Argentina’s peso tumbling against the dollar and cause more economic pain. “But I don’t think there is another option than trusting him. Now more than ever,” he added. “The situation is dire.” During his campaign, Milei – who will take office on 10 December – vowed to abolish the central bank and dollarise the economy in order to overcome a financial calamity that has left 40% of Argentina’s 45 million citizens in poverty and pushed inflation to more than 140%. “I know how to exterminate the cancer of inflation,” Milei proclaimed during last Sunday’s final presidential debate which most pundits believed Massa had won. Milei’s victory was celebrated by other big beasts of the global far-right including Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, who had championed his campaign and has promised to attend his inauguration. “Hope is sparkling in South America once again,” Bolsonaro wrote on X, hailing what he called a victory for “honesty, progress and freedom”. The former US president Donald Trump wrote: “The whole world was watching! I am very proud of you. You will turn your country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again.” His victory was also celebrated by X’s owner Elon Musk, who posted: “Prosperity is ahead for Argentina”. Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – who Milei has repeatedly insulted as a corrupt “communist” – recognised Milei’s victory in a tepid social media post. “Democracy is the voice of the people and must always be respected,” Lula wrote, without mentioning Milei by name. “I wish the next government good luck and success. Argentina is a great country and deserves our complete respect,” Lula added. Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, lamented: “The extreme right has won in Argentina … [It is] sad for Latin America.” “Now say it without crying,” El Salvador’s right-wing president, Nayib Bukele,postedironically in response. Milei’s leftwing opponents reacted with shock and dejection to the election of a notoriously erratic figure whose radical ideas include legalising the sale of organs, cutting ties with Argentina’s two biggest trade partners, Brazil and China, and closing more than a dozen ministries. Milei – a climate-denying populist who is known by the nickname El Loco (the Madman) – has also enraged millions of Argentinians by questioning the four-decade consensus over the crimes of its 1976-83 dictatorship, during which an estimated 30,000 people were killed by the military regime. His vice-presidential running mate is Victoria Villarruel, an ultra-conservative congresswoman who has played down the dictatorship’s sins. “He is way more excessive and unstable than [Jair] Bolsonaro and Trump. So it’s highly unpredictable what this person could do [in power],” Federico Finchelstein, an Argentinian historian who studies the global far right, said on the eve of Sunday’s election. Benjamin Gedan, the head of the Wilson Centre’s Argentina Project, said he believed one word explained the scale of Milei’s victory: desperation. “This vote just reeks of desperation. A lot of Argentines voted knowingly against their economic interests because they recognise that the status quo is catastrophic. And there was no reason to believe that the current finance minister could plausibly be the answer,” Gedan said. “It’s a huge gamble but not a completely irrational one.” Gedan said the election of such a radical and inexperienced political outsider thrust Argentina into uncharted waters. “The real risk is that Argentina melts down in his attempt to radically transform the economy. That would look like massive social unrest, national strikes by unions, potential political violence and stresses against the democratic institutions. There is a pretty dark scenario if in fact he pursues aggressively his maximalist vision for Argentina.” After hours of tension, there was an explosion of noise on the streets of Buenos Aires as news of the result spread and citizens reacted with a mixture of joy, apprehension and anger. “Vamos Milei, the change is coming!” one woman could be heard shouting from a balcony in Recoleta, not far from the president-elect’s campaign HQ. “Never again!” a male voice bellowed, in reference to the human rights violations that took place under Argentina’s military regime. “Milei is the dictatorship”.",Mon 20 Nov 2023 00.24 CET,20.0,11.0,2023.0
457,Guardian,Ukraine Zelenskiy calls for operational changes to military after sacking commander3h ago,Unknown,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has demanded rapid changes in the operations of Ukraine’s military and announced the dismissal of the commander of its medical forces. The Ukrainian president’s move was announced on Sunday as he met defence minister, Rustem Umerov, and coincided with debate over the conduct of the 20-month-old war against Russia, with questions over how quickly a counteroffensive in the east and south is proceeding. “In today’s meeting with defence minister Umerov, priorities were set,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “There is little time left to wait for results. Quick action is needed for forthcoming changes.” Zelenskiy said he had replaced Maj Gen Tetiana Ostashchenko as commander of the medical forces. “The task is clear, as has been repeatedly stressed in society, particularly among combat medics, we need a fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers,” he said. This, he said, included a range of issues – better tourniquets, digitalisation and better communication. Umerov acknowledged the change on the Telegram messaging app and set as top priorities digitalisation, “tactical medicine” and rotation of service personnel. Ukraine’s military reports on what it describes as advances in recapturing occupied areas in the east and south and last week acknowledged that troops had taken control of areas on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in southern Kherson region. Ukrainian commander in chief, Gen Valery Zaluzhny, in an essay published this month, said the war was entering a new stage of attrition and Ukraine needed more sophisticated technology to counter the Russian military. While repeatedly saying advances will take time, Zelenskiy has denied the war is headed into a stalemate and has called on Kyiv’s western partners, mainly the United States, to maintain levels of military support. Ostashchenko was replaced by Maj Gen Anatoliy Kazmirchuk, head of a military clinic in Kyiv. Her dismissal came a week after a Ukrainian news outlet suggested her removal, as well as that of others, was imminent after consultations with paramedics and other officials responsible for providing support to the military. Meanwhile on Sunday, air defence units in Moscow intercepted a drone targeting the city, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Sobyanin, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said units in the Elektrostal district in the capital’s east had intercepted the drone. According to preliminary information, falling debris resulting from the operation had caused no casualties or damage, Sobyanin said.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 23.46 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
458,Guardian,"US politics Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter and former first lady, dies aged 962h ago",Richard Luscombe,"Rosalynn Carter, wife of the 39th president Jimmy Carter, has died at the couple’s Georgia home aged 96. Carter, who became one of the nation’s leading mental health advocates during and after her husband’s time in the White House, was diagnosed with dementia in May. On Friday, her family announced she hadentered hospice careat home, joining her 99-year-old husband in end-of-life treatment in the Plains one-story residence they shared since before Jimmy Carter was elected a Georgia state senator in 1962. The former president has been in hospice care theresince Februaryafter declining further medical intervention for his own health issues. “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” Jimmy Carter said in a statement released Sunday afternoon by the Carter Center. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.” The statement said Mrs Carter “died peacefully, with family by her side” at 2.10pm ET. An online tribute book is open atwww.rosalynncartertribute.org. Chip Carter, the couple’s middle son, said: “Besides being a loving mother and extraordinary first lady, my mother was a great humanitarian in her own right. Her life of service and compassion was an example for all Americans. “She will be sorely missed not only by our family but by the many people who have better mental health care and access to resources for caregiving today.” The former first lady was born Eleanor Rosalynn Smith in August 1927, in Plains, a small rural town of fewer than 600 people where her husband was also born and raised. She was a fiercely loyal ally throughout his political career, both in the White House and during his years as a respected international diplomat after his single term in office ended in 1981. But she also forged her own identity for her mental health advocacy and as a social justice activist. She founded the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiversin 1987, and remained active in the organization into her later years. The Carter Center, a human rights non-profit founded by the couple, paid tribute to her work in itsstatement earlier this yearannouncing her dementia diagnosis. “Mrs Carter has been the nation’s leading mental health advocate for much of her life. We recognize, as she did more than half a century ago, that stigma is often a barrier that keeps individuals and their families from seeking and getting much-needed support,” it said. “We hope sharing our family’s news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor’s offices around the country.” First lady Jill Biden on Sunday paid tribute to Carter during an event in Virginia. Joe Biden said the former first lady had “integrity”. Before departing the event in Norfolk, Virginia, the US president said: “The Carters are an incredible family because they brought so much grace to the office.” Former president George W Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, in a statement called Carter “a woman of dignity and strength”. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Carter was a “saintly and revered public servant” driven by faith, compassion and kindness. “On the world stage, first lady Carter was a pioneer. Her historic, high-stakes diplomatic mission to Latin America in 1977 ushered in a new era of engagement in the region. Two years later, she became the first sitting first lady to address the World Health Organization, where she argued that mental health was an aspect of physical health – and that health is a human right,” Pelosi said in a statement offering condolences to the Carter family. Rosalynn Carter and her husband were also supporters of Habitat for Humanity, raising awareness and funds for the Carter Work Projectnamed for them, and frequently tackling projects themselves as “some of our best hands-on construction volunteers”. The Georgia-based charity that the Carters worked for tirelessly said its members were saddened by her passing. “She was a compassionate and committed champion of #Habitatfor Humanity and worked fiercely to help families around the world,” the group said on Twitter/X. One of the couple’s final public appearances was at the Plains Peanut Festival in September, days before Jimmy Carter’s 99th birthday, when theyrode the parade togetherin the back of an SUV. Their families were already known to each other when they met while Jimmy Carter was at the US naval academy in Maryland during the second world war.

459,Guardian,UK politics Rishi Sunak could block Human Rights Act to force through Rwanda asylum plan6h ago,Rajeev Syal,"Rishi Sunak is considering blocking a key human rights law to help force through plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda amid growing pressure from rightwing Conservative MPs. No 10 has discussed the possibility of “disapplying” the Human Rights Act to an emergency bill in an effort to minimise legal challenges againstthe prime minister’s key immigration policy. Ministers are aware such a proposal could face rebellions in the Commons and the Lords, which could vote down the proposals. A Conservative party source said: “This would tear the party apart. Several cabinet ministers and the one nationers would not stand for it – the prime minister wouldn’t even get it through the Commons. Never mind that this wouldn’t placate the head-bangers on the right either.” The government’s quandary has emerged as a former supreme court judge said the proposals to send people seeking asylum to the east African country with no possibility of a return to the UK were “probably dead”. The prime minister is under intense pressure from the Conservative right to get the scheme working as part of his pledge to “stop the boats” amid the Channel refugee crisis. Right-leaning MPs are demanding that a flight takes off for Kigali before the next general election, which is expected to take place before the end of 2024. It follows a ruling by the UK’s highest court on Wednesday that Sunak’s flagship policy is unlawfulbecause of the possibility of “refoulement” – that refugees are at risk of being sent back to their country of origin by the Rwandan government. Refoulement is prohibited by international laws, including the European convention on human rights (ECHR), the UN refugee convention and the UN convention against torture, which have been given effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act. Discussions about blocking the Human Rights Act had taken place in Downing Street since the ruling, sources said. Hours after the court ruling, Sunak said he would upgrade the agreement with the Rwandan government to a treaty and launch an emergency bill within weeks to prevent court challenges. Ministers are looking at requiring MPs to sit on Fridays and reordering the parliamentary timetable to accelerate a new bill. Party sources said they were aware that dozens of Tory MPs could vote with Labour to block any such change. Any block on human rights laws could also face objections in the House of Lords because of mounting concern it would breach the UK’s international law obligations under the ECHR. The hard-right New Conservativesgrouping demanded that Sunak’s new legislation “must disapply the Human Rights Act”, while the former home secretary Suella Braverman, who was sacked by Sunak last week, said the new bill must exclude all avenues of legal challenge. When approached by the Guardian, No 10 declined to comment. The former supreme court judge Lord Sumption said of the Rwanda plan: “I think the current Rwanda scheme is probably dead, but we obviously have to suspend judgment until we see what this legislation or this new treaty looks like.” He also suggested judges in Strasbourg would come to a similar view of the scheme’s legality as UK supreme court justices. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He told Sky News: “The government have made clear … that they don’t intend to do that [withdraw from the ECHR]. Although the government may well ignore interim orders from Strasbourg, they presumably intend to comply with final orders from Strasbourg. It [the Strasbourg court] will investigate safety for itself and probably arrive at a conclusion very similar to that of the supreme court.” He said he was “sceptical” of reported plans to send British civil servants to work in the east African country, adding: “The main problem [with the] scheme is that it outsources to Rwanda the decision about whether people have refugee status.” Speaking on Sunday, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, defended the government’s plans for emergency legislation and added that the government did not want to leave the ECHR despite calls from the right of the Conservative party. “I think we will see that, because I do think, when you interview me next year, we will be having a discussion about how we have succeeded in this plan, and I will be saying: look, it wasn’t easy, we kept at it, but that is what we promise to do,” he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Ministers are under pressure to process the asylum claims of tens of thousands of people who arrived in the UK after the illegal migration act was passed in July. Immigration experts said ministers could be in breach of the UN refugee convention because asylum seekers were being held – in some cases in detention centres – indefinitely. They have no prospect of being removed to a third safe country or being granted access to the asylum system in the UK under the act. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “The Illegal Migration Act is unfair, unworkable, and expensive. It’s causing huge distress and anxiety for those we support with rising levels of acute mental health problems for already traumatised men, women and children. There are serious questions about the legality of leaving people in this situation indefinitely and the government should swiftly take action by allowing them all to be given a fair hearing in the asylum system and treated with compassion and dignity.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 20.24 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
460,Guardian,Donald Trump Illinois governor ‘deeply concerned’ by rhetoric reminiscent of Nazi era6h ago,Richard Luscombe,"Donald Trump’s rhetoric on immigration, his plans for a second presidency if he wins next year’s election, and his description of political enemies as “vermin” reflect the language of 1930s Germany and the Nazis’ rise to power there, a senior Democrat warned on Sunday. JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor of Jewish descent whohelped drive the constructionof the state’s Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Chicago, added his voice to a wave of condemnation over the former president’s remarks. Joe Bidenlast week also likened Trump’s comments to the era when Nazi Germany orchestrated the murders of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, saying “it isn’t even the first time” he had done so. Trump had deliberately chosen to use words “that are unfortunately reminiscent of the past”, Pritzker said during an appearance on MSNBC’s Inside with Jen Psaki. “The rhetoric that’s being used by Trump, by some of the Maga (Make America great again) extremists, is rhetoric that was used in the 1930s in Germany [and] I am very concerned about the direction of the country if we see policies like what Donald Trumpis espousing come to light,” he said. “In Germany in the 1930s people that they didn’t want to have power, people that they wanted to separate and segregate, they began calling them immigrants, even people who had been in Germany for generations. This is a way to begin to segregate people and then eventually … dehumanize and kill people. “I don’t know where it’s going with Donald Trump. What I can tell you is that the things that he talks about are frightening to those of us who know the history of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. And I’m deeply concerned about his predilection for revenge and what that will mean for groups of people that didn’t support him in the 2024 election if he gets elected.” Highlighting Trump’s extremism has become a key part of messaging from the Joe Biden White House and Democratic party as the runaway leader in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination moves further ahead of his challengers. “Employing words like ‘vermin’ to describe anyone who makes use of their basic right to criticize the government echoes dictators like [Adolf] Hitler and [Benito] Mussolini,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said during apress briefing last week. “Using terms like that about dissent would be unrecognizable to our founders, but horrifyingly recognisable to American veterans who put on their country’s uniform in the 1940s” and defeated the Axis Powers which included forces from Hitler’s Germany and Mussolini’s Italy during the second world war. Pritzker expanded on the theme Sunday in his interview with Psaki, Biden’s former White House press secretary. “I repeat it wherever I go, that Donald Trump is dangerous for our democracy. He’s dangerous for specific minority groups in the US. And I think that for those of us who have a platform to call it out it is a requirement,” he said. “I’m deeply concerned about the rise of hate. I worry about it on our college campuses. We’ve seen protests, and I think it’s everybody’s right to express themselves. What I don’t want is protests and counter-protests encountering each other and that turning into violence.” Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The governor also had words of comfort for Democrats concerned at recent polls placing Trumpahead of Bidenin several key swing states. “I don’t think yet people have really put these two next to each other and evaluated what the philosophies and agendas are,” he said. “People don’t really focus until, let’s face it, after the conventions. It’s just in those final couple of months, July all the way through November, that this needs to be brought home to people. “When that happens, that crystallization will occur in people’s minds and people will see that the democracy that they believe in, the country that they owe their allegiance to, that the best thing for America is to put aside the authoritarian Donald Trump.” Trump was in Texas near the border with Mexico on Sunday to promote an escalation of hard-line immigration policies that he adopted while in office. Those policies alarmed civil rights activists and drew court challenges.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 20.50 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
461,Guardian,Netherlands Far-right Party for Freedom makes gains in poll ahead of election11h ago,Senay Boztas,"Leftwing parties in the Netherlands have urged people to vote strategically to avoid a far-right government after a poll showed last-minute gains for Geert Wilders’ Party for Freedom (PVV). Wilders, whose manifesto calls for an asylum “stop” and ban on “Islamic schools, Qu’rans and mosques”, said it was a “game changer” when a poll on Saturday evening put him level with Mark Rutte’s party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). The pollster Maurice de Hond – who overestimated Wilders’ share by five seats in the last election – found in asurveyof almost 7,000 people on 17 November that the PVV and VVD were neck and neck in 26 of the 150 seats, thanks to a five-seat surge for Wilders after anaggressive performancein a television debate. Pollsters pointed out that two other major polls are coming out on Monday and Tuesday. Sjoerd van Heck, of Ipsos, said that if Wilders has surged in all of the last polls, including its own, “a rallying effect of leftist voters seeking to block a PVV-led government is likely to happen”. Since the new head of Rutte’s party, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, said early in the campaign that she would not, like Rutte, exclude the PVV from coalition negotiations, Wilders has taken an intermittently milder tone. In an interview with the current affairs programme Nieuwsuur, he promised concessions on anti-Islam polities, but has never apologised for calling for “fewer Moroccans” in a 2014 speech for which he has acriminal record. Leftwing leaders were quick to warn progressive voters to vote strategically for the centre parties.Frans Timmermans, the European heavyweight who is leading a new coalition of Labour and the Green Left, said: “It’s clear that Ms Yeşilgöz hasopened the door for Wildersin the government. This would mean someone participates in running the country who dismisses a million Dutch [Muslims] as second-class citizens.” The new head of the D66 liberal democrats, Rob Jetten, said there was a “big risk” of an extreme-right government.“The VVD, knowing full well what it was doing, let thegovernment fall[in July], when it could have led migration on to a better path, then Yeşilgöz sets the door wide open to Wilders, so she has created this dynamic,” he told the broadcaster NOS. With three days before elections, pundits say the outcome is hard to call in this splintered, proportionally representative system. Another leading candidate,Pieter Omtzigt, and his New Social Contract party have repeatedly said they would not govern with the “anti-constitutional” PVV. Following the poll, on Sunday afternoon, Omtzigt said that he is open to becoming prime minister if his party wins the most seats and has a cabinet of ministerial subject specialists. A week ago he told reporters he would rather lead his faction from parliament than take up residence in the PM’s tower. A keypotential coalition partner, the Farmer-Citizen Movement, has suggested the PVV could be a silent partner supporting a minority government – although this arrangement ended disastrously for a previous Rutte administration. On Sunday,Yeşilgöz-Zegerius– a former refugee of Turkish-Kurdish origin who is campaigning for further controls on immigration – distanced herself from extreme viewpoints. “I refuse to shut out a single voter … [but] the PVV has policies like wanting the Netherlands to leave Europe, it wants a Nexit, it ignores climate problems, which would completely destroy this country,” she told the broadcaster WNL on Sunday. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “The differences are enormous. Wilders has had a constructive week, his tone is moderated, all his standpoints are being binned: I don’t know how believable that is.” De Hond told the Guardian that while 60% of voters were still considering two parties, the surge he measured may come true and was certainly affecting the debate. “You can be number one and still not in the government,” he said. “A lot of voters want to show they are not happy with how [Rutte’s] government operated. The four parties in the last government together will lose around 40% of their votes, which will go to protest parties. Wilders has been on television when before he was not, and in a debate on Thursday on a TV channel with most rightwing potential voters, he was number one by far.” But, he admitted, “voters can move in the last couple of days”.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 15.51 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
462,Guardian,‘The emperor’s hallmark’Hat worn by Napoleon fetches record €1.9m at Paris auction10h ago,Kate Connolly,"A two-cornered hat worn by Napoleon Bonaparteduring his reign as French emperor has fetched a record €1.932m (£1.69m) at an auction in Paris. The black bicorne beaver felt hat was initially estimated at €600,000-800,000. The price reached surpassed the €1.884m paid for another of Napoleon’s hats in 2014, also sold by the Drouot auction house, a spokesperson for the company said. The hat is one of 20 remaining out of 120 the French military commander is believed to have owned in his lifetime. The sale price is thought to have been inflated by the hype surrounding the release this month of Ridley Scott’s Napoleon biopicstarring Joaquin Phoenix. Napoleon wore his hats sideways to ensure he was distinguishable on the battlefield – and thus created one of the most recognisable brands in history, which has endured since his death more than 200 years ago. The points or “corns” were placed parallel to his shoulders, a style referred to as “en bataille”, in contrast to the majority of his officers, who wore theirs at right angles to their shoulders. Pierre Osenat, of the the Drouot auction house, said the hat was distinguishable by a “cockade” – a cluster of ribbons of distinctive colours that Napoleon reportedly added himself in 1815 when he was travelling across the Mediterranean to Antibes from his exile in Elba, leading to a temporary return to power before his eventual defeat at Waterloo. Most of the remaining Napoleonic bicornes still in existence are held in museums, and about five are in private collections, Osenat said. The bicorne hat’s excellent provenance was due to it remaining in the possession of the same family throughout the 19th century, the descendants of the quartermaster Jean-Louis Noisiez who had worked at Napoleon’s palace, Osenat said. Osenat told French media before the auction: “This hat was discernible by everyone. When they saw it in battle. they knew without a doubt that Napoleon was present. “In private, he’d either have it on his head or in his hand, sometimes throwing it on the ground. It was the emperor’s hallmark.” Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The hat was the star item in the sale of the collection of the French industrialist Col Pierre Baillon, who died last year. It was auctioned alongside: a nightshirt worn by Napoleon on the isle of St Helena, where he was exiled for the last time and where he died in 1821; a silver dinner plate stolen from his carriage following his defeat at Waterloo in 1815; and a mahogany vanity case, containing a well-preserved sterling silver toothbrush, razors, scissors and other items he used, which fetched up to €60,000. Other items in the sale included firearms, swords and coins. In 2014, a South Korean buyer paid just under €1.9 m for a bicorne Napoleon had worn during the Battle of Marengo in 1800.

463,Guardian,"‘It may help. It may not’First he was the change PM. Then came the king’s speech. Now a spectacular reshuffle. Can Rishi’s endless resets ever work?Is the Tory PM’s latest gamble, to bring back David Cameron as foreign secretary, a stroke of genius or the last desperate gamble of a drowning man?",Toby Helm,"Dressed in a crimson velvet cloak, trimmed and lined with white ermine, and flanked by two senior Conservative peers, Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, the new foreign secretary, will be formally introduced into the House of Lords on Monday amid all the colour and splendour that the second chamber affords. The former prime minister, who everyone thought had bid a final farewell to Westminster in 2016 after the humiliation of the Brexit referendum, will then deliver his maiden speech the following day in a debate on international trade. It could well go down as the political comeback of the year, if not the decade. The imagery of the return of an ex-PM who left under such a cloud, and was subsequently embroiled in a major lobbying scandal, may not be perfect for Rishi Sunak, as he attempts his latest leadership reset. But something had to be done. The Tories were in a death spiral. “Suella [Braverman] was mad and taking us down,” said one Conservative MP. “This was what Rishi came up with. It may help, it may not.” The decision stunned everyone in the Tory party, including good friends of the former occupant of No 10, and those who had served in his governments. “David always had a thing, I thought, about not wanting to be in the Lords. Yes, I was surprised,” said one ally, now in the upper house. “Like Major, Blair, Brown, he didn’t seem to want to do it, having been prime minister.” Negotiations on the comeback were kept as the tightest of secrets in Downing Street. Only two or three people are said to have known anything, apart from Sunak and Cameron himself. Former Tory leader William Hague is believed to have been the key interlocutor, and to have convinced Cameron that a stint as foreign secretary (Hague had been in the job under Cameron) would be a good way to restore his reputation at home and abroad and conclude his career on a high note. So when the news broke, it came as a bolt from the blue. Last Sunday morning the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, who was completely in the dark at the time, was sent out on the TV media round by No 10 and clearly felt he had to put on a partial defence of Braverman in case she survived any reshuffle. She was facing a barrage of criticism for having inflamed tensions at the pro-Palestinian march the day before, after accusing the police of leftwing bias. The first Shapps would know of the reshuffle next day, in which Braverman was unceremoniously fired and Cameron installed, was when he saw the ex-PM strolling up Downing Street. Sunak and his team knew it was all a gamble. They were aware that the Tory parliamentary party these days is far more rightwing than it had been in Cameron’s time. The 2019 election result saw many more rightwing pro-Brexit MPs arrive, particularly from “red wall” seats. But among southern and metropolitan voters, Sunak and his allies thought Cameron would play well. Within hours of the reshuffle, groups of rightwing Tory backbenchers were, however, meeting in the Commons to discuss both setbacks for their wing of the party: the loss of standard-bearer Braverman, and the return of the remainer and social liberal Cameron. James Cleverly, an affable moderate, had made way at the foreign office and taken Braverman’s place. “Rishi’s Big Throw of the Dice,” said the Daily Mailnext day. Sunak was risking a “revolt on the Tory right” the paper added, while noting, more positively, that “in a bold move” Sunak had recalled ex-TV presenter Esther Mc Vey to be “minister for common sense” in charge of “rooting out woke culture”. By Tuesday, Downing Street minds were turning to the announcement, due the following morning, from the supreme court on the legality of the government’s policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, which had been championed by Braverman and had got bogged down in legal challenges. It was the cornerstone of Sunak’s entire immigration policy. One of the five pledges on which he has staked his reputation is to “stop the boats”. As No 10 wargamed how to respond to the possible scenarios, depending on how the judgment went, there was also nervousness about what Braverman might do. After her sacking, she had promised to say more in due course. As it turned out, Braverman decided to go for broke on the afternoon before the supreme court gave its verdict, and in terms that astounded everyone. Even experienced Westminster hands had never seen aletterlike it. On page after blistering page, she tore into the prime minister, accusing him of having “manifestly and repeatedly failed” to honour promises he had supposedly made to her when she agreed to back his leadership campaign last year. Braverman’s support for Sunak had been vital in preventing Boris Johnson from mounting a comeback. “Either your distinctive style of government means you are incapable of doing so or as I must surely conclude now, you never had any intention of keeping your promises,” she wrote. And in what seemed to be an attempt to pre-empt a negative judgment by the supreme court, she accused Sunak of failing to prepare for that eventuality, and of “magical thinking” about potential future challenges he might mount to keep the Rwanda plan in play. So extreme was her language and so intemperate, that most Tory MPs thought the letter had damaged her more than Sunak, ending any remote chance she may once have had of becoming leader. “When you write a poison pen letter, you do it in three paragraphs, not three pages,” said one senior backbencher. “It just showed that she was not fit to be home secretary in the first place, let alone leader.” But – while Braverman was imploding – none of this was playing well for Sunak or the Tories. The latest reset was merely highlighting party divisions, not healing them. The media coverage was all about Conservative party and government turmoil and splits. Labour’s own problems, over Keir Starmer’s refusal to call for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, were attracting less coverage than they otherwise would have had, allowing the Labour leader partially off the hook. It was also escaping no one that Sunak now seemed to be attempting to reset his government every few weeks, whether it was at the party conference, through theking’s speechor by conducting blockbuster reshuffles. And each reset seemed out of sync, in policy terms, with the last one. They did not build on each other, but seemed increasingly contradictory. In September, at the Tory conference in Manchester, Sunak had become the“change” prime minister, differentiating himself from the Conservative PMs who had gone before him – including Cameron. To make the point he had dumped the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2, a decision Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, both condemned in public only a few weeks ago because they had advanced HS2 and believed in it. As Starmer would put it at prime minister’s questions, “his [Sunak’s] big idea is to keep turning his government on and off at the wall and hoping that we see signs of life”. After 13 years it was not, however, proving easy to find a way forward whichever way Sunak looked: forwards or back, left or right. Wednesday morning offered a sudden, if brief, ray of hope for Sunak and his team as it emerged thatinflation had dropped to 4.6% in the year to October, down from 6.7% the month before. The story led the BBC news for a couple of hours. But then the supreme court delivered its unanimous verdict. A senior Labour frontbencher could not believe the party’s good fortune. “They [the Tories] had had their best news for months, even years, and then … the Rwanda decision.” The supreme court ruling was the cue for even worse Tory bloodletting than had come before. The court found that the Rwanda policy was unlawful because migrants faced a real risk of being sent back to their home countries where they could be mistreated. This would be in breach of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), which is enshrined in the Human Rights Act. Sunak’s entire immigration policy looked in shreds. Rightwing MPs started calling for the UK to reassess its position in the international legal system. Danny Kruger, the MP for Devizes, said the scope of the ruling meant the UK’s involvement in other treaties and conventions had now to be considered. “The government should immediately announce an intention to do what is necessary to insist on our sovereignty. That means legislation to override the effect of the European court, of the European convention on human rights itself and of other conventions including the refugee convention if necessary.” Speaking after an emergency meeting of the rightwing New Conservativesgroup of Tory MPs, the party’s deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, said: “It’s a dark day for British people. We should just get the planes in the air right now and send them to Rwanda. People are fed up in this country. They’re fed up of being taken for a ride and paying their taxes to people who have no right to be here and are criminals. The government need to show our leadership and send them back same day.” Sunak held a press conference in Downing Street and announced he was taking the “extraordinary step” of rushing emergency legislation through to declare that Rwanda was a safe country. There would also be a new treaty with Rwanda as part of legal process to keep the policy alive. There was a sense of desperation spreading across government. The immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, appeared to stake the survival of Sunak’s government on a strategy that would in effect mean the UK challenging international law. “I don’t see a path to victory at the next general election unless we resolve this issue,” he said. The legal establishment reacted with barely concealed horror. Bar Council chair Nick Vineall said: “The Bar Council notes with grave concern the prime minister’s suggestion that legislation might be introduced, the purpose of which is apparently to deem Rwanda to be a safe country to which to return asylum seekers. “If parliament were to pass legislation the effect of which was to reverse a finding of fact made by a court of competent jurisdiction, that would raise profound and important questions about the respective role of the courts and parliament in countries that subscribe to the rule of law.” In the Commons, Cleverly suggested it would not be necessary to leave the ECHR, while later in his press briefing Sunak signalled that this would have to be an option, despite the huge knock-on effects such a move would have, not least the fact that the ECHR was central to the Good Friday agreement. “If we leave the ECHR the Good Friday agreement goes down the tubes,” said a former cabinet minister. Immediately, there were indications from senior peers that such emergency legislation would face numerous challenges in the upper house, not least because the Rwanda plan had not been in the 2019 Tory manifesto in the first place. Lucy Powell, shadow leader of the Commons, asked which bills in the recent king’s speech, which formed the basis of the last but one Sunak reset, would have to be ditched to make way for new Rwanda law. Had King Charles been wasting his time? “The ink is not even dry on the government’s king’s speech yet the prime minister is already proposing a treaty and new laws to mask their utter failure to get a grip on illegal immigration.” Tory friends of the new foreign secretary in the Lords, meanwhile, raised the question of what the newest recruit to their ranks might think: “All I know is I can’t see him wanting to leave the ECHR. If that were to become policy I think we could have a serious problem.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 07.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0

465,Guardian,"‘There are no crops to celebrate’Climate crisis wipes out a way of life in Taiwan’s mountains Countless landslides in Nantou county are disrupting ancient agricultural traditions, leading some to wonder how much longer they can continue to cling to the steep slopes they call home49m ago",Helen Davidson,"Halfway up Taiwan’s central mountain ranges, two young women were working a shift at the town’s service station in August when the landslide hit. As torrent of water, mud and rocks gushed down they ran next door for shelter, a decision that probably saved their lives. Moments later, the station became buried under tonnes of earth and rock. The disaster in Ren’ai township was one of countless landslides in the same month across Nantou, a landlocked county in central Taiwan, triggered by torrential rain brought by the whipping tail of distant typhoon Khanun. The county in the central region of Taiwan’s main island is set in a dramatic range of lush, jungle-covered mountains. Thousands of peaks, some higher than 3,000 metres above sea level, stretch sharply into the sky from narrow valleys and rivers. They are sparsely populated, with small towns and villages accessed by winding single-lane roads, where aboriginal tribes are among those making a living mostly through agriculture, and holding on to ancient traditions. They say they have never seen so much water. Landslides are not uncommon in Taiwan, the whole island is in a hot zone for typhoons and earthquakes. However, mountain communities like Nantou are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, and things are getting worse amid the climate crisis. This was the fourth time since 2000 that the service station had been hit and some are beginning to wonder how much longer their traditional way of life can continue. The local economies are largely based on agriculture, and indigenous customs are tightly linked to seasonal harvests. Nantou is the ancestral homeland of the Seediq people, one of 16 recognised aboriginal tribes in Taiwan, and the modern home of several others. The August typhoon caused the cancellation of autumn harvest ceremonies, an annual ritual lasting up to a week. “There is nothing to harvest,” says Wang Wan-quan, a 70-year-old farmer in Nang Feng village in Nantou. “They were all destroyed by typhoons, covered by landslides, and damaged by heavy rain. We can’t celebrate anything. There are no crops to celebrate.” Wang draws his income from growing tea and organic vegetables. “When a typhoon comes, some people will make money and some won’t,” he says. Zi-jun Zeng, the village head in Nang Feng, says rising temperatures, increased extreme weather events, and changing climates are exacerbatingthe weakening of Aboriginal culture, disrupting ceremonies, changing harvest patterns and the annual celebrations tied to them. “Indigenous communities in Taiwan are all farming communities. The culture is always connected to the land,” he says. Climate scientists say changing weather patterns are making typhoons, known elsewhere as cyclones or hurricanes, much more intense. A 2016 study published in Nature found the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 hitting east and south-east Asia had doubled or even tripled in the preceding four decades. A report released in March by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found it was “likely” that the proportion of category 3-5 cyclones had increase globally over the past four decades, and that it was “very likely” the proportion of category 4-5 cyclones would increase with global heating. The IPCC also said it had “high confidence” that anthropogenic climate change had contributed to extreme rainfall amounts during intense cyclones. Taiwan draws most of its drinking water from typhoons. Although the frequency of intense typhoons is increasing, the overall number making landfall has dropped significantly,prompting record-breaking droughts. When they hit, their increased strength brings floods and landslides, and hurt local economies by destroying crops and the roads along which produce is transported for sale. Chen Guo-xiong Che, the major secretary for the township covering Nangfeng, says they are seeking to adapt farming strategies, citing efforts to plant more trees among the monoculture tea and coffee fields. But the current infrastructure of the tribes couldn’t handle this latest downpour. “I am worried about climate change ,” says Chen. “This year’s typhoon impact was bigger and temperatures are higher. We’ve never experienced so much water. “Climate change directly impacts us and those living in high altitude. The large quantity of rain in a short time cut off the main road and the farm road – people’s road to work … The road is ruined in seven or eight places and directly affects livelihoods and incomes. “Villagers living in the mountains are not scared of natural disasters, they can face damage. But we hope the government can help with better construction and infrastructure.” Dr Lin Tze-luen, a spokesman for the executive branch of Taiwan’s government, tells the Guardian his country has become adept at preparing for and responding to disasters, “but now the challenge is climate change”. “There is a debate, some say people should relocate. But indigenous culture is rooted in that area … We know it affects traditions but it’s difficult and we try to increase their resilience,” Lin says, citing the provision of satellite phones to residents who decide to stay, and increased government subsidies for home insurance. In Ren’ai township, days after typhoon Khanun, the rubble is nearly cleared but the service station building is ruined. Mangled pumps are covered by a layer of mud, and water is still pouring across the road from the collapsed hillsides. The town’s response is organised and practical. There are local government representatives, disaster response charities, and community volunteer groups. Some young male residents returned from military conscription service to hike through devastation to reach stranded residents and deliver supplies. One of the young women who escaped the service station is now helping her neighbours clear the mud and debris. Few talk of leaving this place. Wang, who travels in a mobility scooter, says he won’t leave, but it was a close call this time. He was out checking on a neighbour when a landslide hit his house. “The cloud stopped over our tribe and wouldn’t go away,” he says. “We had never seen such rain as this.” Additional research by Tzu-wei Liu",Mon 20 Nov 2023 01.47 CET,20.0,11.0,2023.0
466,Guardian,‘Determination that never stopped’The life of Rosalynn Carter3h ago In pictures Rosalynn Carter,Unknown,"The Washington chattering class, often unsure what to make of outsiders, dubbed Rosalynn Carter the “steel magnolia” when she arrived as first lady. A devout Baptist and mother of four, she was diminutive and outwardly shy, with a soft smile and softer Southern accent. That was the “magnolia”. She also was a force behind Jimmy Carter’s rise from peanut farmer to winner of the 1976 presidential election. That was the “steel”. Yet that obvious, even trite moniker almost certainly undersold her role and impact across the Carters’ early life, their one White House term and their four decades afterward as global humanitarians advocating peace, democracy and the eradication of disease. Through more than 77 years of marriage, until her death Sunday at the age of 96, Rosalynn Carter was business and political partner, best friend and closest confidant to the 39th president. A Georgia Democrat like her husband, she became in her own right a leading advocate for people with mental health conditions and family caregivers in American life, and she joined the former president as co-founder of The Carter Center, where they set a new standard for what first couples can accomplish after yielding power. “She was always eager to help his agenda, but she knew what she wanted to accomplish,” said Kathy Cade, a White House adviser to the first lady and later a Carter Center board member. Rosalynn Carter talked often of her passion for politics. “I love campaigning,” she told the Associated Press (AP) in 2021. She acknowledged how devastated she was when voters delivered a landslide rebuke in 1980. Cade said a larger purpose, though, undergirded the thrills and disappointments: “She really wanted to use the influence she had to help people.” Jimmy Carter biographer Jonathan Alter argues that only Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton rival Rosalynn Carter’s influence as first lady. The Carters’ work beyond the White House, he says, sets her apart as having achieved “one of the great political partnerships in American history”. Cade recalled her old boss as “pragmatic” and “astute”, knowing when to lobby congressional brokers without her husband’s prompting and when to hit the campaign trail alone. She did that for long stretches in 1980 when the president remained at the White House trying to free US hostages in Iran, something he managed only after losing to Ronald Reagan. “I was in all the states,” Rosalynn Carter told the AP. “I campaigned solid every day the last time we ran.” She flouted stereotypes of first ladies as hostesses and fashion mavens: she bought dresses off the rack and established an East Wing office with her own staff and initiatives – a push that culminated in the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 to steer more federal money to treating mental health, though Reagan reversed course. At The Carter Center, she launched a fellowship for journalists to pursue better coverage of mental health issues. She attended cabinet meetings and testified before Congress. Even when fulfilling traditional responsibilities, she expanded the first lady’s role, helping to establish the regular music productions still broadcast as public television’s In Performance at the White House. She presided over the inaugural Kennedy Center Honors, prestigious annual awards that still recognize seminal contributions to US culture. She hosted White House dinners but danced only with her husband. Her approach befuddled some Washington observers. “There was still a women’s page in the newspaper,” Cade recalled. “The reporters who were on the national scene didn’t think it was their job to cover what she was doing. She belonged on the women’s page. And the women’s page folks had difficulty understanding what she was doing, because she wasn’t doing the more traditional first lady things.” Grandson Jason Carter, now Carter Center board chairman, described her “determination that never stopped”. She was “physically small” but “the strongest, most remarkably tough woman that you would ever hope to see”. Including as Jimmy Carter’s political enforcer. She “defended my grandfather in a lot of contexts, including against Democratsand others”, confronting, in person or via telephone, people she thought had damaged his cause, Jason Carter said. Yet she nearly always connected politics to policy and those policy outcomes to people’s lives – connections forged from her earliest years in the Depression-era deep south. Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born 18 August 1927, in Plains, delivered by nurse Lillian Carter, a neighbor. “Miss Lillian” brought her son, Jimmy, then almost 3, back to the Smith home a few days later to meet the baby. Not long after, James Earl Carter Sr moved his family to a farm outside Plains. But the Carter and Smith children attended the same all-white schools in town. Years later, Rosalynn and Jimmy would quietly support integration – and call for it more vocally at Plains Baptist Church. But growing up, they accepted Jim Crow segregation as the order of the day, she wrote in a memoir. Rosalynn and Jimmy each endured challenges of rural Depression life. But while the Carters were considerable landholders, the Smiths were poor, and Rosalynn’s father died in 1940, leaving her to help raise her siblings. She recalled this period as inspiration for her emphasis on caregivers, a way of classifying people that Alter, the biographer, said was not used widely in discussions of US society and the economy until Rosalynn Carter used her platform. “There are only four kinds of people in this world,” she said. “Those who have been caregivers; those who are currently caregivers; those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.” As she grew up, Rosalynn became close to one of Jimmy’s sisters. Ruth Carter later engineered a date between her brother and Rosalynn during one of his trips home from the US Naval Academy during the second world war. Jimmy, newly commissioned as a Navy lieutenant, and Rosalynn were married 7 July 1946 at Plains Methodist Church, her home church before she joined his Baptist faith. Already an appointed school board member, Jimmy decided to run for state Senate in 1962, without consulting Rosalynn. She embraced the decision because she shared his goals. Four years later, Jimmy ran for governor, giving Rosalynn the first chance to campaign by herself. He lost. But they spent the ensuing four years preparing for another bid, traveling the state together and separately, with a network of friends and supporters. It would become the model for the “Peanut Brigade” they used to blanket Iowa and other key states in the 1976 Democratic primary season. Those campaigns for governor solidified mental health as Rosalynn’s signature issue. By the time they got to the White House, Rosalynn had distinguished herself as the center of Carter’s inner circle, even if those beyond the West Wing did not appreciate her role. Carter sent her on diplomatic missions. She took Spanish lessons to aid her Latin America voyages. She decided herself to travel in 1979 to Cambodian refugee camps. Spurred by a Friday briefing, she was on a plane the next week, having put together an international delegation to address the crisis. “She wasn’t just going to have pictures made ... she watched people die,” Cade said. She traveled to US state capitals and urged lawmakers to adopt vaccine requirements for schoolchildren, winning over converts to policies that largely remain intact today, recent fights over Covid-19 vaccine mandates notwithstanding. Rosalynn wanted her husband to delay the treaty ceding control of the Panama Canal, pushing it to a second term. She met regularly, without the president, with pollster Pat Caddell. They discussed a re-election path she knew was perilous on the heels of inflation, rising interest rates, oil shortages and the Iran hostage situation. Distraught upon their return to Plains in 1981, she dived back into the farming business. But the void would not begin to close until the former president conceived The Carter Center. In their Atlanta outpost, she found an enduring platform from which to travel the world, pushing to eradicate Guinea worm disease and other maladies in developing countries, monitoring elections, elevating discussion of women’s and girls’ rights and continuing her mental health advocacy. All while living in the same Georgia village she once wanted to leave forever. “My grandparents, you know, have a microwave from 1982 ... They’ve got a rack next to their sink where they dry Ziploc bags, reuse them,” Jason Carter said recently, explaining their “simple” and “frugal” style in the same home where the Carters lived when Jimmy was first elected as a state senator. There, the former first lady welcomed foreign dignitaries, Joe Biden and Jill Biden, aspiring politicians seeking advice and, as her health declined, a new generation of Carter Center leadership. She liked to serve pimento cheese sandwiches, fruit and, depending on the guest list, a few glasses of wine. And she came with an agenda. “Mrs Carter would always be the first one at the door, and she would insist on walking me to the door at the end,” Paige Alexander, CEO of The Carter Center, said of her sessions in Plains. “That final walk ... so she could get her last points in was, I think, quite indicative of the relationship that they had and how she managed it from the governor’s mansion all the way through.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 23.27 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
467,Guardian,‘Hell de Janeiro’Scorching heat highlights Brazil’s glaring inequality,Constance Malleret,"The start of summer in the southern hemisphere is still a month away, but Brazilhas already experienced its eighth heatwave of the year so far, as temperatures soar to dangerously high levels. Large swathes of the country were put under red alert this week by Inmet, the national meteorological institute, which warned of risks to health “and even life” as temperatures stayed at least five degrees Celsius above average for more than five days. The dangers were brought into sharp relief by the death of a fan at a Taylor Swift concerton Friday night in Rio de Janeiro, at which thousands of other concertgoers reportedly had to be treated for dehydration. Ana Clara Benevides Machado, 23, collapsed in the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos stadium and died shortly afterwards, reportedly from a cardiac arrest, after sweltering conditions were reported at the venue where the temperature was far higher than the official 39.1C outside. The singer joined fans and politicians in expressing her shock at the death. Swift wrote on social media that she was “devastated” at the news, and “overwhelmed by grief”. At the start of the concert, fans were reported to have shouted repeatedly towards the stage for “water, water, water”, after allegedly being prevented from taking supplies into the stadium with them. Brazil’s justice minister, Flávio Dino, posted on X that emergency rules would be implemented requiring leisure venues to allow fans access to water. Other politicians across the region were expected to follow suit. Following Brazil’s hottest July, August, September and Octoberon record, this week’s temperatures were expected to “rewrite climate history” in the country, the Met Sul weather companysaid. Experts partly attribute the excessive heat to a strong El Niño, with the climate crisis making the intensity and frequency of such events more likely. Inmet thermometers repeatedly registered temperatures above 40C across the centre-west and south-east, with a peak of 43.3C in Corumbá on the border with Bolivia on Wednesday. With temperatures hitting 37.7C and 42.6C, respectively, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro broke records for the year. In Rio, affectionately nicknamed “Hell de Janeiro” by locals, feels-like temperatures reached a staggering 59.7C on Saturday. White-collar workers who usually work from homepoured back into air-conditioned officesto escape the unforgiving heat and astronomical electricity bills, but that was not an option for people like Flávio Figueiredo, a favela moto-taxi driver. The heat “makes work more stressful”, said the 42-year-old, sheltering in the shade of a tree at the entrance of Parque Arará, a favela located off Avenida Brasil – one of Rio’s busiest and most polluted thoroughfares – and backing onto an oil refinery. “If the temperature is, say, 30C, when you stop on the tarmac it feels like 40, 50,” he added. As elsewhere, Brazil’s glaring social inequalities are heightened by extreme weather events. “The reality of a heatwave during the week is not the pictures of crowded beaches. … The reality of a heatwave is packed buses with broken air conditioning, public schools without air conditioning or a functioning fan. That is the reality of climate injustice,” said Marina Marçal, a climate policy specialist who has been advising the Brazilian government on how to address this inequity in its climate and urban agendas. “Poorer areas, like favelas, are the hottest areas,” said Andrews Lucena, a geographer at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro studying extreme urban heat. “Favelas are heat hotspots because they have the worst material construction conditions, an absence of green spaces, and often unfinished buildings, which favours an accumulation and excess of heat.” Sign up to Global Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion Often dependent on clandestine hookups to the grid, favela residents are also more likely to suffer from frequent power and water outages. “Public authorities don’t look [at us], there’s no effort to improve things,” said Luis Cassiano Silva, an Arará resident, putting this down to structural racism. Like 56% of Brazilians – and 67% of favela residents – Silva is Black. The favela’s oppressive heat always bothered the 54-year-old, who previously lived in leafier areas and has a propensity to sweat excessively. Twelve years ago, he took matters into his own hands and created a green roof on his house, working with researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro to design a prototype that worked on more precarious constructions. Today, the flourishing roof garden keeps his terrace below noticeably cooler. “It’s lovely,” said the environmental activist, before adding “but seriously, it’s really hot … and it keeps getting worse.” The heatwave was expected to peak over the weekend, according to the Inmet meteorologist Dayse Moraes, but a particularly hot summer could lie ahead. “If it gets much hotter, I don’t know how we’ll cope,” said Marileidi Francisco, 42, a shopkeeper in Arará. Silva has tried to replicate his cooling roof, but although his Teto Verde Favela project helped green the square where Figueiredo was sheltering from the sun, the garden roofs haven’t really taken off in Parque Arará, which remains a blistering red and grey jumble of brick and corrugated iron. To cool down, residents simply turn to “an outdoor shower or a beer at the bar” said Silva, mopping his dripping forehead, while round the corner the gangsters who control the area sought relief in a pool they had set up on the street.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 12.02 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
468,Guardian,"'Insurance policy against extinction'The doomsday vaults storing seeds, data and DNA to protect our future",Ella Braidwood,"Are we allowed to go in?” I surprise myself with this question, given that I’m staring through the small window of a door into one of six underground vaults, each one essentially a walk-in freezer. The temperature inside is -20C. It is a grey winter day at the Millennium Seed Bank in Wakehurst, Sussex and the maze of featureless corridors and reinforced concrete adds to the1984-ish austerity of the setting. These vaults are designed to withstand the worst apocalypse we can imagine – be it caused by bombs, radiation, floods or disease. Dr Elinor Breman, a senior researcher, and my guide for today, briefly hesitates before responding: yes, I can, but only if I sign a waiver and don’t have any heart conditions. This seems fair enough. I sign a declaration, having read the warnings of frostbite and hypothermia, and Breman hands me a protective blue coat. She flicks a switch before we go in. When I look at her quizzically, she casually explains that this is so an alarm goes off if we’re not out in five minutes. Inside, the door shut behind us, I’m greeted by the one antidote we’d need in the face of impending annihilation: a larder lined with rows and rows of sealed glass jars full of seeds. This is the largest seed bank in the world – nearly 2.5bn seeds are conserved here, ready for use in hundreds, if not thousands of years to come. Most seeds are frozen in these vaults, though a smaller number are cryopreserved instead and stored in vats of liquid nitrogen at -180C. Fans whir, the cold presses in on me. Breman picks up a couple of jars, but she can’t tell me which seeds are inside – a barcode system is used to decipher them, yet another layer of security. In total, this facility is a backup for almost 40,000 wild plant species worldwide, including nearly all of the UK’s native flora, from cowslips and bluebells to knotgrass. After about two minutes, and with my fingertips tingling, we make our exit. Built in 2000, this seed bank is one of as many as 1,700 worldwide, otherwise known as ‘“doomsday vaults”: facilities intended to safeguard humanity in the event of civilisation’s collapse. It isn’t just about seeds – researchers are preserving everything from DNA to data, and even faeces. Should it all go wrong, these Noah’s Arks could provide the blueprints for our recovery. As Breman puts it, the Millennium Seed Bank is an “insurance policy against extinction”, helping preserve the planet’s rapidly declining biodiversity. And the outlook is bleak: two in five plant species are facing extinction according to one report by Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which also coordinates this project. The main causes are, invariably, human practices – industrial farming, deforestation, pollution, climate change and so on. Yet humans depend on plants for food, medicines, clothing, building materials and, quite literally, the oxygen we breathe. “You could look at it as an altruistic thing, but it is also actually survival,” adds Breman. “We need these plants to survive.” The concept of doomsday vaults began in the 1920s, when the Russian botanist Nikolai Vavilov set one up in what is now St Petersburg. It still exists today and during the Second World War a number of its scientists purportedly died of hunger rather than eat the collection during the 28-month siege of Leningrad, all the while protecting it from starving citizens and encroaching German troops. Most vaults act like regular financial banks – you make a deposit, which is securely stored, and then you can withdraw it when you need it. Yet while the doomsday name conjures up images of end-of-the-world events, many banks are already in use, for research purposes or to address more localised catastrophes already before us, such as war or natural disasters. The Millennium Seed Bank, for example, has been using its collection to restore chalk grasslands in the South Downs for more than a decade now, with other projects in Madagascar, Indonesia and Mexico. Seeds from Vavilov’s institute, meanwhile, were used to restore crops in the Soviet Union after the war. In the frozen mountainsof Svalbard, a remote archipelago between Norway and the North Pole, lies another doomsday vault, this one seeking to preserve the world’s data. Opened in 2017, the Arctic World Archivestores data on physical reels of film, owned by Norwegian company Piql, some 300m inside a decommissioned mine. The vault, says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, seeks to “help preserve world memory, irreplaceable information for the benefit of future generations”. In an era of cyber-attacks and misinformation, it is also concerned, he adds, with “making sure that it is done in a way where information and data cannot be manipulated, cannot be edited, or changed according to any person or organisation’s ideas”. Over Zoom, Bjerkestrand holds up a strip of film, which is part of the vault’s collection. It appears transparent but, held against the light, and with Bjerkestrand’s arm as a backdrop, I can make out its contents: a tiny visualisation of the Taj Mahal, representing a 3D scan of the monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. Also preserved in the vault is Sweden’s entire database of art, comprising some 140,000 pieces, a selection of manuscripts from the Vatican library, and a digitised version of Edvard Munch’s The Scream. In 2020, Git Hub, the world’s largest source code host, announced it had stored 21TB of data on 186 reels of film at the vault. As at the Millennium Seed Bank, security is paramount. The facility is alarmed and has video surveillance. Polar bears, says Bjerkestrand, act as security guards. (I let out a chuckle at this, but Bjerkestrand is serious. “You laugh, but a couple of years ago there was a Dutch guy taken for breakfast by a polar bear just a few hundred metres from the entrance of the vault.”) The land naturally lends itself to the preservation of the photosensitive film: the vaults are dry, dark and, thanks to the surrounding permafrost – permanently frozen ground – extremely cold. So ideal is this island for preservation that it’s home to another bank, the Global Seed Vault. Opened in 2008 by the Norwegian government, it’s essentially the agricultural equivalent of the Millennium Seed Bank. With more than 1m seed varieties, including rice, wheat and beans, it is a backup facility for crops vital to food production and is used as a secondary repository for long-term storage by other seed banks internationally. Like the Millennium Seed Bank, its importance is already proven: in 2015, researchers from a seed bank in Syria became the first to take out a deposit so as to restore their collections in Morocco and Lebanon, after fleeing the civil war. When it comes to planning a vault, many considerations come into play. It must be a secure facility in somewhere as geopolitically stable as possible (Svalbard, for example, is demilitarised). “The world is getting very complicated,” as Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, president of the Microbiota Vault, puts it, her point made by the tragedies of recent wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Dominguez-Bello’s project, still in the early stages, seeks to preserve microbial biodiversity, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. While some microbes are pathogens, others are beneficial to human health, helping with digestion and the prevention of illness, and it is these which the Microbiota Vault will seek to preserve by cryopreserving human faeces. “Microbiomes [the collection of all microbes that live in our body] are, for each one of the species of this planet, vital,” says Dominguez-Bello. Human practices, such as the overuse of antibiotics, threaten this equilibrium, she says. Potential sites mooted so far include some old military bunkers in the Swiss Alps or somewhere in Norway. But cost, as is the case for other vaults, is a barrier. Dominguez-Bello estimates her vault would take “hundreds of millions” to make a reality. “We need big money to make the project self-sustaining,” she admits. “Again, it’s a hard thing in the current world.” Others are lookingfurther afield – even to the moon. In 2021, engineers from the University of Arizona unveiled ambitious proposals for a solar-powered “lunar ark”, which would seek to cryopreserve seeds, sperm and egg samples and store them in a facility built into the moon’s lava tubes – networks of conduits formed by streams of lava billions of years ago. The idea is that the ark would protect the planet’s biodiversity should there be a sudden, cataclysmic event, such as a supervolcanic eruption or a major asteroid strike. “Our current civilisation is actually quite volatile,” says Jekan Thanga, a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the university, who is leading the project. “But these kinds of events can really reshape Earth.” Thanga stresses that vaults on Earth aren’t necessarily braced for catastrophes. Owing to climate change, the permafrost is melting on Svalbard and gene bank collections have been destroyed or looted in Iraq and Afghanistan. A few years ago, the Philippines’ national gene bank was flooded. But Thanga’s plans look like they’d need some refining – currently the proposals seek to preserve just 50 samples from each species, via an estimated 250 rocket launches; this is a far cry from the practices at the Millennium Seed Bank where the ideal collection is made up of 10,000 seeds of each species. Don’t these proposals seem a bit, well, out of this world? Thanga admits it could be a challenge to make them a reality. “Our sense is that with the cryopreservation units, optimistically, we need to be advancing all these fields within the next 30 years to really get there. And it’s by no means going to be low-cost here.” Back down on Earth, Brendon Noble is chair of the board of the Frozen Ark project which has so far cryopreserved some 48,000 samples of genetic material from endangered animals, totalling around 5,500 species, including honeybees, North Africa’sscimitar-horned oryx– now extinct in the wild – the Colombian spider monkeyand thesnow leopard. For Noble, their work is one of a “survival obligation” for humans. Animals and insects are key to the maintenance of our ecosystems, such as for pollination, food production and medicines. But the situation is undeniably grim. Last year, a WWF report found that global wildlife populations had plummeted by 69% in the past 50 years, largely linked to human activities, from deforestation to poaching and industrial pollution. “People are talking about the sixth great extinction and the fact that we’re in the middle of it, we’re not waiting for it,” he explains. “The fifth one actually got rid of the dinosaurs… The rate at which we’re losing species is just utterly astounding.” If humanity is seemingly so ill-fated, isn’t there a temptation to just give up? Noble strongly disagrees. “I think it’s really important to feel that we’re taking action,” he says. “We’re doing what we feel is a solid contribution to making things work.” He looks to animals as a treasure trove of possibilities for humans – researchers have long studied thenaked mole-rat, for example, because it doesn’t get cancer. “There’s so many species in the world that have incredible powers, if you like characteristics, and the DNA is the blueprint,” says Noble. “Why wouldn’t we want to preserve that and understand it?” The need for seed banks can feel bleak and yet Breman sees them as beacons for hope. “I think that everybody who works at the Millennium Seed Bank would say that what we’re doing is providing options for the future,” she says. “Every seed that’s banked here has the potential to help change the world.”",Unknown,,,
469,Guardian,Suck carbon from the air?US facility launches novel climate solution,Katharine Gammon,"Inside a vast new warehouse in the Californiatown of Tracy, tall towers of trays containing a gray powder are stacked in neat rows. It’s all part of Heirloom, a company that promises to use limestone to directly remove carbon dioxide from the air and store it deep within concrete, keeping it out of the atmosphere. The facility – the first commercial direct air capture (DAC) plant in the US – opened last week. Capturing and stowing away carbon from the air was once considered a far-fetched idea.Today, scientistsand political leaders see it as an inevitable tool in mitigating the climate crisis. Money from both private and public sources is pouring in, and the Biden administration has committed to spending at least $3.7bn to kick-start DAC and other carbon-removal projects across the United States. Heirloom’s facility uses limestone – the second most abundant mineral on Earth – to sponge up carbon from the air. The process begins when industrial kilns heat the limestone to 1,650F (899C), which breaks it down into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. The carbon dioxide is then stored in con​​crete, which can be used for construction projects. The remaining powder – calcium oxide – is spread on trays that are sprayed with water and sit in the open air and absorb carbon, which naturally binds to the gas. The process then begins all over again, using heat to separate out the newly captured carbon. Other direct air capture systems use huge fans to pull air, and Heirloom says it uses a few but that their system takes less energy because it leverages limestone’s natural ability to pull carbon molecules out of the air. The Heirloom chief executive, Shashank Samala, says he was inspired to climate action by his childhood in south-east India, where he grew up among heatwaves and droughts, and hopes the warehouse will be the first of many. “For me, it’s really important to work on a solution that actually has a meaningful, scaled impact on climate change, to actually make a dent on this,” he said. Making a noticeable dent could take some time. The facility can absorb a maximum of 1,000 metric tons of CO2 per year – just a fraction of the annual emissions from a gas-fired power plant. The company hopes to remove 1bn tons of carbon dioxide by 2035, though Samala admits scaling up will be a challenge: to reach the company’s goals in the next 12 years, they’ll have to increase their capacity three times each year. All that scaling up will also take money, and tech firms are going in for direct air capture: Microsoft has signed a long-term contract with Heirloom to suck up to 315,000 metric tons of CO2, to offset the tech company’s own emissions and reach its net-zero goals. A fund called Frontier has pledged$46.6m to Heirloomand another carbon-sucking venture. Heirloom says it’s powered by renewable energy from a local provider, and that it won’t take investments from oil and gas companies. One use for carbon captured from DAC plants is toenhance oil extractionby injecting carbon into oil wells to make them more productive, but that doesn’t align with the company’s values. “We felt the space needed leadership and values and we wanted to make sure that the carbon dioxide pulled from the air is not used as an excuse to put more CO2 into the air,” said Samala. Heirloom has received a $600m award from the Department of Energy to build a hub in Louisiana that can process up to a million tons a year. The facilities are modular, Samala says, so it’s a matter of putting limestone on larger trays and stacking more trays. There are still hurdles in making meaningful contributions to lowering carbon dioxide, says Farzan Kazemifar, a mechanical engineer at San José State University. Direct air capture is an expensive and energy-hungry process. Because only a tiny fraction of carbon is removed from the atmosphere, it takes a lot of air – and a lot of powerful fans – to push through enough material to get the carbon out. “The atmosphere is big, and any direct air capture is little, and the economics are still challenging,” said Brad Sageman, an earth and planetary scientist at Northwestern University. But it’s important to pursue every possible solution to the climate crisis, he says, “because even if we succeed in applying all of them, we still aren’t sure whether we’re going to be able to fix the problem”. Samala says he hopes the world starts to take notice of direct air capture and the role it can play; just as city governments pay to pick up trash, people need to think about paying for removing the carbon they produce. “We need to pay for the CO2 we are putting out there,” he said.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 13.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
470,Guardian,Solar power to the people California program brings clean energy to Oakland,Unknown,"Joseph Wang and his wife have figured out a way to stay warm and efficient during northern California’s winter nights: layering. “We bundle up during the day, and at night. We use two blankets,” said Wang, 87, in Mandarin, explaining how he and his wife, Meng Rou Lan, 84, dealt with trying to save money on their electricity bill last winter. When he and his wife were hit with a $130 electricity bill, they decided to use their heater sparingly. But soon, due to a publicly funded statewidesolarprogram in California, their bill may go down as much as $40 a month. Wang is a resident of St Mary’s Gardens, an affordable housing complex with 100 units for low-income seniors in Oakland, California. St Mary’s Gardens is one of more than 100 projects in California that have had solar panels installed as part of the state-funded Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (Somah) program. The state is allotting $100m a year in public funding starting in July 2019. By 2030, the program’s goal is to power 300 megawatts through new solar projects on low-income rental buildings across the state – akin to the amount of electricity generated by a small nuclear power plant, or enough to provide power to 150,000 tenant families. The program provides financial assistance to owners of affordable housing buildings, and also education to tenants. A little more than 100 low-income rental buildings have completed solar installations through this project, and the owners of hundreds more are interested, according to Somah. The financial incentives saved through solar directly benefit low-income tenants, and the program is designed so that people who live in the most “disadvantaged communities” – those affected most by environmental pollution and the climate crisis – can benefit from multibillion-dollar investments in clean energy from the government. “Our core goal is to give back to these vulnerable communities that sometimes lack voices in this space,” said Staci Givens, program manager of Somah. California paved the way for solar programs, as one of the sunniest and largest states in the throes of worsening climate conditions. Solar panels have become popular to assist in energy conservation, and oftentimes have benefited wealthier neighborhoods. In an effort to make solar energy more equitable, the Biden-Harris administration approved a $7bn Solar for All program for states across the country. According to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryreporton solar installations in the US, people who have solar panels on their rooftops are disproportionately high-income earners. California also has the most households with rooftop solar, comprising 50% of the US total. The overall snapshot of people who have solar tend to be middle-aged, white and primarily English-speaking, and work in business or finance and live in rural areas, according to the Berkeley Lab. Gideon Anders said that when he first heard about the Somah program, he didn’t know much about the ins and outs of solar panels. As a board member and treasurer of the St Mary’s Gardens Elderly Housing Limited Partnership, he and other members decided to install solar because it was a great opportunity for the building and the residents. “When we found out about the program, and we found the level of incentives that were being made available, we basically determined it was a deal that we couldn’t pass up,” Anders said. Ayesha Abbasi, state organizer for Asian Pacific Environmental Network (Apen), an environmental and advocacy organization based in Oakland, California, approached the manager of the St Mary’s Gardens building as part of her outreach work. Apen helped to write the legislation that started Somah. St Mary’s Gardens was a perfect candidate to benefit from the clean energy program: a building with low-income senior tenants, propped next to freeways and a port diesel corridor. The total cost of installing solar energy in a building like St Mary’s Gardens is about $345,000, and it has taken three and a half years. “It was a lot of work put into making these projects [successful],” Abbasi said. For St Mary’s Gardens, the entire cost of installation was covered by the state because the building doesn’t own the solar panels, but is contracting with Sunrun, a solar power company, to maintain the panels for the next 20 years, Anders said. Givens estimates that once PG&E approves the installation and connects to the grid, each unit could save from $30 to $40 a month. The solar panel project led the building owners to pursue other clean energy ideas. Anders said they already upgraded the building’s common space HVAC system to an electric heat pump, and replaced gas water boilers with electric ones. Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion However, getting buildings to install solar has some challenges. First, many people don’t have the technical skills or staffing to oversee a big construction project, Givens said. Somah does provide technical assistance to building owners, but it still requires a staff person to have time to manage the work. Second, building owners may have to pay some out-of-pocket costs, whether upfront for the construction – a rebate is given only after solar has been installed and connected – or when signing a lease with a solar contractor. Once contractors have installed solar panels, they have to wait for the electric company to inspect and hook them up to the grid, which can take some time – at least eight months. But the larger goal for some is not only to financially benefit individuals and families, but to help contribute to the eventual closing down of coal-powered plants and the gradual reversal of the effects of the climate crisis. “We need to scale it from these rooftops, to a region, to a state, to a country, in order to see an impact,” said Mari Rose Taruc, energy director at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “We start from a roof, but we want to see it scale up.” The seniors at St Mary’s Gardens said they want the environment to be cleaner because they have been affected by poor air quality from wildfires. “When the air pollution is bad, it is bad for us seniors,” Yun Hao Zhang, a resident at St Mary’s Gardens, said in Cantonese through a translator, Apen community organizer Sky Liang. One resident said she wanted the program to help other seniors. “We get to enjoy this green energy, but there are so many more low-income seniors out there like us who could benefit,” said Meng Rou Lan.

471,Guardian,‘They’ll have to kill me first’Locals in DR Congo oppose plans to drill for oil,Josephine Moulds,"Jean Bolengu Ekunja drove his spear into the ground. “We won’t compromise,” he told the crowd gathered in Baringa, a village deep in the Congo basin rainforest. “If oil activity is what they are going to do here, they will have to kill me first, as the chief. Then they will have to slaughter all the population!” The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is auctioning rights toexplore for oil in large swathes of rainforestand other protected areas across the country. Baringa, in the northwest, is one of scores of communities affected. The process has sparked fierce yet familiar debate about environment and development, and set the stage for a legal fight over community rights. DRC’s hydrocarbons minister, Didier Budimbu, has said the country needs to extract its oil and gas “so that our children can eat and we can develop our economy”. It is the latest attempt to exploitfossil fuel resourcesin one of the world’s poorest countries, where almost two-thirds of people survive on less than $2.15 (£1.73) a day, the international poverty line. The first contracts – for gas extraction from Lake Kivu – were signed in September, but the deadline for bids to look for oil in the heart of the rainforest has been pushed to next year. Many previous attempts to exploit DRC’s fossil-fuel reserves have ended in failure, beset with scandal and officials cancelling contracts. This time around, the DRC has promised the auction will be transparent, impartial and competitive. But an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) revealed a process plagued with apparentpreferential treatment and backroom deals. Some of the oil blocks up for auction lie within the Congo basin rainforest, which is peppered with small farming and fishing communities. DRC law requires the government to get the opinion of local people before any project or activity that may have an impact on the environment, yet people here say they have not been asked about the auction. A few hours upstream from Baringa and several kilometres further into the forest is Lisoko, a farming community. With no phone network or radio coverage, the community has little access to news about the oil block auction.Nadine Bolumbu, the chief of this and six neighbouring villages, said no one apart from Greenpeace had told them about the auction. She said the villagers’ position was clear: “We owe our survival to the forest. We refuse oil exploitation in our group.” Budimbu and the ministry of hydrocarbons declined to comment. People in Lisoko gather cassava leaves and fat yellow caterpillars from the swampy forest surrounding the village, where African teak trees loom out of the water, some reaching up to 50 metres high. This tangle of trees serves as a hunting ground for wild boar, antelopes and other bushmeat, and villagers catch fish in its pools and streams. Bamboo and thick branches provide structures for their one-storey homes, many built from earth packed and cooked into bricks. The lack of infrastructure raises questions over how realistic oil exploration is. After a flight from Kinshasa, Lisoko is a two-day trip by motorboat up the Congo river and its tributaries, then a journey into the forest. There are few roads here, just narrow tracks for motorbikes to whip along, their drivers ducking to avoid low branches and fallen trees. Goods are transported via the river, with live goats on makeshift rafts and timber piled high on barges. Exporting oil from this area would involve building hundreds of miles of pipeline through dense rainforest. Similar licences acquired from the government in the past have remained unused for years due to the huge investment they require. Vincent Rouget, a director at the consultancy Control Risks, said the current government may have intended to raise funds from the auction before the forthcoming election in December. Instead it has become an election issue, with the leading opposition candidate, Moïse Katumbi, stating that he would scrap plans to explore for oil in the Congo basin if he wins. That opposition stretches beyond the DRC. Last year, the US climate envoy John Kerry asked the government to withdraw some of the oil blocks to protect the tropical rainforest – the last in the world with enough trees to absorb more carbon than it emits. International and Congolese environmental organisations have called for the government to scrap the auction altogether. At least 13 of the blocks overlap protected areas, according to Greenpeace Africa. That includes the world’s largest tropical peatlands, near Lisoko, which fan out from tributaries of the Congo river in the northwest. It has been described by experts as the worst place in the world to drill for oil because peatlands lock in partially decayed plant matter that, if disturbed, could release vast amounts of carbon, dramatically adding to global heating. It is also an area rich in wildlife, including bonobos, crocodiles and forest elephants, among many other species. Set against the trilling of crickets, kingfishers and hornbills, the government’s promise to ensure that any oil exploration is done responsibly rings hollow. Sitting under a palm-roofed shelter out of the punishing midday sun, Albert Ifaso Bonguli, one of Lisoko’s village elders, asked: “After this exploitation, what will be left here? They’ll abandon the land with the craters, there will be water pollution, all the animals will flee.” He was unconvinced that oil would bring jobs to local communities, which desperately need funds to send their children to school and pay for medical care. Few people here end up in secondary education, where final exams cost more than $70 (£56) – a huge sum for people whose main source of income is from the surplus bushmeat, vegetables and fish they can sell in local markets. “The villagers don’t know anything about this kind of work,” Bonguli said. “The income from the oil will not benefit the Congo, only the investors who are financing the exploitation.” The government has so far struggled to attract bidders for the oil blocks, and some major companies, such as Total Energies, have said they will not take part. Finding funding and insurance for projects to extract oil in the rainforest may also prove difficult. Many financial institutions have committed to ensuring that any projects they support have the free, prior and informed consent of affected communities. Generali, Hannover Re, Talanx and Zurich have, according to Greenpeace, ruled out providing cover for oil and gas blocks in the DRC. Hannover Re said this was due to “expectations and exclusions” relating to environment, social and governance issues. The lack of consent from the communities that TBIJ visited was evident. They may not have been consulted, but many have heard rumours of the auction. Seeing a group of outsiders speeding through the village on motorbikes and assuming they were there to take the oil, local people shouted: “Thieves!”, “We refuse!” and “Get out of here!” Back in Baringa, Ekunja said his village has not been consulted on the auctions. But it had discussed them – and their answer was clear. “Non! N-O-N!” he shouted, drawing cheers from the crowd.

472,Guardian,Musk ‘believes in America’De Santis defends X owner after antisemitic post Florida governor claims he hasn’t seen the message in which Musk tweeted an enthusiastic agreement with antisemitic post9h ago,Richard Luscombe,"Ron De Santis defended Elon Musk as “a guy that believes in America” on Sunday as the Florida governor refused to condemn X’s billionaire owner for an antisemitic post that caused numerous key advertisers todesert the social media platform. In an interview Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union, the Republican Florida governor claimed he had not seen the message on the platform that was formerly known as Twitter. The message – in which Musk said an X user who accused Jewish people of hating white people was speaking “the actual truth” – wasdenounced by the White House on Friday as “abhorrent”. Instead, De Santis dedicated his remarks on CNN to exalting Musk as a banner carrier for free speech. And he dismissed other prominent right wingers who haveexpressed antisemitic positionsas “fringe voices”. “Elon has had a target on his back ever since he purchased Twitter, because I think he’s taking it into a direction that a lot of people who are used to controlling the narrative don’t like,” said De Santis, whose campaign for the Republican 2024 nominationcontinues to crater. “I was a big supporter of him purchasing Twitter.” When State of the Union host Jake Tapper brought Musk’s widely condemned “actual truth” message to the screen, De Santis said he had “no idea what the context is” and said he would not “pass judgment on the fly”, although he said he stood against antisemitism “across the board”. “I know Elon Musk,” De Santis said. “I’ve never seen him do anything. I think he’s a guy that believes in America, I’ve never seen him indulge in any of that. So it’s surprising if that’s true.” Critics have previously accused the governor of beingslow to condemn rallies by neo-Nazisin his state, some carrying flags with the words: “This is De Santis country.” He has attempted to portray the criticism as a “smear campaign” by political opponents while a campaign aideposted a “reprehensible” tweetsuggesting De Santis’s Nazi supporters were actually Democratic party staffers. After Sunday’s CNN interview, senior Democrats were skeptical of De Santis’s insistence he hadn’t seen Musk’s message. The message drew headlines globally and prompted disgusted major companies – including Apple, Disney, IBM and Warner Brothers – to suspend advertising on X. “The guy’s running for president, and Elon Musk [posted] that on Wednesday. It’s Sunday. So this is four days later, and he has not had the chance to read what Musk wrote? That is very hard for me to believe,” Democratic US House member Jamie Raskinof Maryland told Tapper. “You showed it to him, and he still refused to condemn it. If you’re serious about condemning and confronting antisemitism, and racism, and these bigotries, which are the gateway to destruction of liberal democracy, you’ve got to be explicit and open and full throated about it when you’ve got [the opportunity] to denounce antisemitism and racism across the board.” De Santis has vocally supported Israel since its war with Hamas began in October. On Sunday, he urged greater US support for the Israeli’s military’s onslaught against Hamas in Gaza. “We need to let Israel win this war,” De Santis said. “We should support them publicly and privately to actually finish the job, because if you just do some glancing blows, Hamas is going to reconstitute itself and we’re going to end up in the same cycle going forward. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “Israel’s in a situation where they suffered the biggest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. You have an organization, Hamas, that wants to wipe Israel totally off the map. This is not just some minor dispute.

473,Guardian,Chagos Islands Family still wait for return of migrant worker’s body after unexplained death on UK-US military base,Katie McQue,"A major US defence contractor has failed to repatriate the body of a migrant worker who died under unexplained circumstances on the British-owned island of Diego Garcia more than a month ago, the Observerhas learned. Saddam Ali died after a short illness on 18 October, on the secretive joint UK-US military base on the remote British overseas territory in the Indian Ocean. His family allege that KBR – Ali’s employer – failed to get the 33-year-old Indian sufficient medical assistance, keeping him on the base, which does not have ahospital-gradefacility. More than 1,000 migrant workers are contracted to work for KBR – a key Pentagon contractor that helped build Guantánamo Bay in Cuba – on the military base, which the UK has leased to the US since the 1960s. Strategically located, the atoll of Diego Garcia is crucial for US interests, lying within range of east Africa, the Middle East and Asia. However, thetreatment of migrant workerson its vast military base has become a source of increasing concern. “It was KBR’s responsibility to evacuate Saddam for better treatment. They should have taken prompt action to evacuate him,” said Dr Junaidul Hasan, his cousin. “They are not providing any information about why they did not.” In a statement to the Observer, KBR said: “Saddam reported ill to us Monday, 16 October and we transferred him to the naval doctors and called a medevac [medical evacuation] for him that same day.” However, Hasan and three KBR workers claim Ali’s body remains on Diego Garcia, part of the Chagos Islandsarchipelago. “They informed us they would arrange [a medevac] but it was never arranged,” said Hasan. Ali, who had no underlying health conditions, became sick with a fever and died of a heart attack, KBR told the family. They have not been provided with any further details about what caused his death. Last night the defence contractor said Ali “passed before it [the medevac] could arrive.” Questions over the potential mishandling of Ali’s medical care comes amid allegations that KBR is “mistreating” its migrant workforce on the base. Ordered by a senior Royal Navy officer, the inquiry was launched after UK officials suspected KBR of recruiting undocumented workers for the military base. Last November, KBR flew three Filipino men, aged 36, 40 and 49, to the tiny British territory from Dubai, where they were believed to be working illegally on tourist visas, according to two KBR employees. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO) said: “The UK government and the British Indian Ocean Territory [BIOT] administration take any allegations of forced labour or human trafficking extremely seriously.” The FCDO spokesperson said its investigation concluded the men entered Diego Garcia legally but requested the Observerto withhold the names of the UK officers involved in the investigation. The three Filipinos are still working on the base, it is understood. KBR, a former subsidiary of controversial oil services giant Halliburton, which was run for five years by Dick Cheney before he became US vice-president, refuted allegations that it recruited undocumented workers and denied the FCDO investigation took place. “In late 2022, three employees who were properly documented arrived on the island without having taken their paperwork with them,” said the spokesperson. “The BIOT asked us to look into this, specifically understanding at the time that the three employees may have simply forgotten their paperwork.” However, Dr Maruja Asis, director of the Scalabrini Migration Center, in Manila, Philippines, said: “For these workers being hired in Dubai and then moving on to Diego Garcia, it is very possible that they may be rendered very vulnerable. The protections that the Philippine government can extend to them can be very limited.” KBR, also known as Kellogg Brown & Root, is the main contractor on the military base, located in the Chagos Islands. The Chagos Islanders were forcefully removed to make way for the Diego Garcia base and have spent the past five decades in exile in Mauritius, Seychelles and the UK. KBR has held the military base’s main operating support services contract since 2017, providing services including facilities management and IT. The Observerhas interviewed 14 current and former KBR employees on Diego Garcia and reviewed documents such as payslips, work contracts, photographs, KBR presentation slides and communications. All the interviewees requested anonymity. They allege a culture of fear on the base, with managers telling staff there is a zero-tolerance policy for workers who speak out. “KBR is always making us scared about this, and we need work to provide for our families,” said Maggie*. “They always say they can terminate our jobs.” KBR recruited the workers after experiencing short staffing issues when the Philippines government blocked Filipinos from travelling to Diego Garcia to work for KBR unless they could show they would be earning more than the US minimum wage. In October 2021, the Philippine government demanded that companies on Diego Garcia pay their Filipino workers the US federal minimum wage of $7.25 (£5.98) an hour. Other contractors on the base complied with this request, but KBR did not, triggering tensions with its employees and the government. Regular warnings are issued by the Philippines government against unlicensed recruiters hiring its citizens, stating they risk falling victim to human trafficking schemes and “unfair labour conditions”. “KBR is trying to avoid hiring Filipinos from the Philippines because they’d have to pay the minimum wage. If these workers don’t have the proper documentation, that’s human trafficking,” said John*, a former KBR employee who resigned earlier this year. Because the Philippine government is blocking workers from travelling to Diego Garcia, workers can’t travel home for vacations and say they are being forced to choose between their job and seeing their children. “We’re tired and exhausted,” said Maggie, a mother who has not seen her young children for more than four years because of the pay dispute. “What KBR is doing to us is inhuman.” To remedy the staffing issues, the British government recently approved hiring limited numbers of Indian and Kenyan workers. However, three Indian workers claim they have been misled over the salaries they would be paid, alleging they were hired in mid-2022 on an $800 a month package, which was then cut to around $500 a month when their annual contracts were renewed this year. “The HR manager said if you want to work, the salary is $500; if you don’t want to work, go back. Many people resigned,” said Rohan*, an Indian worker in his 20s. A small group of Mauritian employees also claim their compensation packages were recently slashed by almost half, with one worker alleging that KBR stated it was deducting a $300 per month meal allowance from them. This meal allowance was written into job offer letters as part of the salary compensation package offered to workers, according to documents seen by the Observer. “We have since invested in culturally appropriate food for non-Filipino employees. Accordingly, when these employees’ contracts expire, we explain that new contracts would provide free meals instead of the food stipends if they want to continue working on the island,” the KBR spokesperson said. “KBR pays its employees on Diego Garcia lawful compensation and provides good and safe working conditions. Our Filipino employees choose to work for us because of this,” the spokesperson added. Workers claim the British and US forces on the base are aware of the pay situation with KBR. Asis added: “The UK and US governments should take action. The frontline face of these military bases are British and American, but behind that is an army of workers coming from developing countries who are doing a lot of work, but whose responsibility are they?” KBR has held meetings with its Filipino employees over the situation with one meeting slide showing that the company claims the Philippine government is “using a misplaced concept that Diego Garcia is a US territory”, and that “paying the US minimum wage would represent a 235% salary increase”. KBR’s spokesperson told the Observerthat the total compensation given to the Filipino workforce exceeds the Philippine government’s mandated hourly rate “when housing, food, medical coverage, and other benefits are included”. * Names have been changed to protect their identities.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 12.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
474,Guardian,Canada Mystery of ‘decades-old’ plane wreck in backcountry solved,Leyland Cecco,"When a hunter in British Columbia stumbled upon the crumpled remains of an airplane fuselage on 3 November, he reported the grim findings to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Officers were dispatched to the remote crash site to survey the wreckage and concluded that the shell of the bush plane, with no motor, wings, doors or seats, was likely more than two decades old. Investigators surmised that the plane had probably been destroyed in a crash, but no bodies were discovered near the site. “Only the fuselage remained,” a police spokesman said. “Additionally, no registration numbers were attached.” The mystery appeared to be inexplicable, until search-and-rescue experts came forward to say they knew just how the plane had ended up in the BC backcountry – because they put it there last year. On Tuesday, Transport Canada publisheda reportabout wreckage north of Kamloops, British Columbia. According to the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, little was known about the aircraft, other than it was “destroyed”, likely by “collision with terrain”. After studying the crash site, officers concluded the wreckage has been on the hillside for decades. But in a subsequent media release, the RCMP deepened the mystery after it said there were no reports of missing planes or passengers. Soon after, however, members of Canada’s Civil Air Search and Rescue Association (Casara) came forward to explain. Search experts placed the wreckage on a mountaintop last summer, as a prop for training programmes, local media outlet Castanetfirst reported. When planes crash in the Canadian backcountry, the wreckage can easily be lost in the vastness of the wilderness. In one case, a large military transport plane carrying 44 crew and passengersdisappeared in the northof the Yukon territory. Despite a massive search effort, no trace of it has ever been found. In an effort to avoid such scenarios, search-and-rescue teams practice on historic wrecks or scrapped planes which have been scattered across the province. “We like to make it as real as possible for them: smoke, injured people. They love it and we get to treat it like a real downed aircraft,” said Fred Carey, director general of British Columbia’s air rescue. Carey said a team hauled the “carcass” of the Cessna up a mountainside north of Kamloops last summer using a logging skidder. “Let’s say it was quite the chore.” The damaged fuselage was never meant to be a secret. After the wreckage was placed near Knouff Lake, both the local airport and the province’s main rescue coordination hub in Victoria were notified, said Carey. “There are placards in the wreck and even a phone number to call,” he said. “I’m not sure what happened, maybe the placards wore off. But in this case, it doesn’t look like the authorities followed protocol.” The RCMP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 14.15 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
475,Guardian,‘That’s not a potato’Mystery of Egyptian treasures found buried in grounds of Scottish school,Dalya Alberge,"In 1952, a schoolboy was digging up potatoes, assisting a gardener in the grounds of his school in Fife as part of a punishment. He stumbled across a bulbous shape that he initially mistook for a potato, only to discover later that he had found an Egyptian masterpiece made some 4,000 years ago. The idea of findingancient treasuresburied in the Scottish countryside, rather than beneath the sands of Cairo, is somewhat unlikely. Yet this was to be the first of 18 Egyptian antiquities unearthed on three separate occasions by schoolboys over some 30 years in the most unexpected of places – Melville House, a historic building near the small parish of Monimail in Fife. Most of the antiquities are now in National Museums Scotland (NMS), which is for the first time telling the remarkable story behind the discoveries. In 1952, Melville House was occupied by Dalhousie School. A teacher brought the boy’s discovery to the then Royal Scottish Museum – now NMS – where its distinguished Egyptologist, Cyril Aldred, realised its significance as an important mid-12th dynasty red sandstonestatue head(about 1922-1855 BC), whose quality suggests a royal workshop. Fourteen years later, in 1966, an Egyptian bronze votive statuette of an Apis bull was found in the same school grounds by pupils doing a PE class outdoors. During a vaulting exercise, one of the boys landed on a spike protruding from the ground. It turned out to date from the Late or Ptolemaic Period (about 664-332 BC). The supervising teacher, a “Mr Mc Nie”, brought the object into the museum for identification. By the strangest of coincidences, he was the very boy who found the head in 1952. Aldred offered to have it cleaned by museum staff, but Mc Nie took the bull away with him and it disappeared without trace. Following the closure of Dalhousie School, Melville House was purchased in 1975 by the then Fife regional council, who used it until 1998 as a residential school for young offenders and children with behavioural issues. In 1984, Dr Elizabeth Goring was the museum’s curator of Mediterranean archaeology when a group of teenagers visited with an object for her to identify. They sensed it might be old, and it turned out to be an ancient Egyptian bronze figurine of a man. Goring recalled her predecessor, Aldred, telling her about previous Egyptian finds in Melville’s grounds, and she realised that the figurine found there must be connected. Its discovery established beyond doubt that there had once been a collection there, but how the objects got there, and why they ended up buried, was a mystery. Intrigued, she decided “to dig a little deeper”, and arranged to visit the school to establish where the figurine had been buried. However, by the time it had been brought into the museum some three years later, its finder had ended up in Saughton Prison in Edinburgh. But a meeting with him at Melville House was arranged under the supervision of his probation officer, and he showed her the rough find-spot. Experts at the British Museum agreed the figurine represented a priest bringing offerings, an unusual subject. It was possibly created during the 25th dynasty (about 747-656 BC). Goring explored the site further, finding other objects, ranging from the top part of a fine faience figurine of the goddess Isis suckling her son Horus to part of a faience plaque bearing the Eye of Horus. Melville House is a fine stately home commissioned by the first Earl of Melville in 1697, and now serves as self-catering holiday accommodation. Goring’s research extended to the antiquities’ legal title, to establish whether they had been assembled by a member of the Leven and Melville family who had once occupied the property. But, in 1984, it was agreed that the finds of that year should betreated as treasure troveand acquired by the museum. The story of the discoveries is being told for the first time by Goring and her successor, Dr Margaret Maitland, in the forthcoming Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, to be published on 30 November. One possible explanation is that they were acquired by Alexander, Lord Balgonie, heir to the property, who visited Egypt in 1856 with his two sisters to improve his poor health after falling ill during service in the Crimean war. But he returned to Britain weaker, and died in 1857, aged only 24, from TB. It is possible that grief and the sad association of the antiquities with his early death prompted someone to dispose of them. It also could be that stories of “the mummy’s curse”, dating to the 1860s, linked such antiquities with ill fortune, prompting someone to bury them. Maitland, NMS’s principal curator of the Ancient Mediterranean, said: “We can’t be sure whether superstition played any role in their abandonment, but it’s not impossible.” The sandstone head, which measures 110mm in height, is on display in the NMS. Maitland said: “This is an extraordinary masterpiece, highly important in terms of Egyptian culture.” Goring added: “Every curator can tell you some extraordinary stories, but this is one of the most extraordinary that happened to me in my 26 years at the museum.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 11.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
476,Guardian,USCalifornia male nanny gets 707 years in prison for sexually assaulting 16 boys4h ago,Unknown,"A male nanny who advertised himself as a “manny” and worked for families across southern Californiabefore being convicted of sexually assaulting 16 young boys in his care has been handed a prison sentence of more than 700 years. Matthew Antonio Zakrzewski, who was also convicted of showing child sexual abuse material to a boy, received his punishment at a sentencing hearing Friday, California prosecutors said ina statement. Prosecutors said he received a total of 707 years in prison in connection with more than 30 felonies for which he was convicted in October. He delivered a statement to the court Friday in which he did not apologize, prosecutors said. “I prided myself on bringing smiles to your children and all the good times we shared were 100% genuine,” the 34-year-old Zakrzewski remarked as victims’ parents covered their ears and wept, according to prosecutors. Zakrzewski was arrested in May 2019 after a couple told Laguna Beach police he touched their son inappropriately. More alleged victims were identified, and Zakrzewski was ultimately charged with 34 felonies, including lewd and lascivious acts with a minor. Victims ranged from two to 12 years old, investigators said. A jury convicted Zakrzewski on all counts, according to the local district attorney. “These young boys were forced to endure unimaginable terror as a result of the ultimate betrayal by a babysitter,” the district attorney, Todd Spitzer, has previously said. Zakrzewski, of Costa Mesa, claimed that he was more than a “manny” who watched over children. He also advertised that he would provide a fun “buddy” experience for those put in his care.

477,Guardian,USFive-year-old who fatally stabbed twin brother won’t face charges in California7h ago,Unknown,"A five-year-old Californiaboy who fatally stabbed his twin brother last week won’t be charged with a crime, according to authorities. The case illustrates how many US states have policies setting a minimum age for prosecution, taking into account knowledge of wrongfulness and criminal intent. In California, children who are younger than 14 are presumed to be incapable of committing crimes unless “at the time of … the act charged against them, they knew its wrongfulness”, according to thestate’s penal code. The twins at the center of the recent killing in Californiawere fighting Wednesday when one brother grabbed a small kitchen knife and stabbed his sibling in unincorporated Scotts Valley, according to the Santa Cruz county sheriff’s office. The wounded boy died at the hospital. “We are heartbroken for the family of these two young children and share in their grief,” the sheriff’s office wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. However, the agency added, authorities do not plan to file criminal charges in the death. “California law dictates that age, criminal intent, and knowledge of wrongfulness are factors needed to charge a child with a crime,” the Facebook post by the sheriff’s office said. “Based on the current investigation, there is no indication of negligence or criminal activity by any other party” either.

478,Guardian,"Australia One in 10 Australian men report having sexual contact with under-18s, study finds7h ago",Andrew Messenger,"Francene Reo’s stepdad told her it was therapy. In 1976, the Newcastle supreme court found it was child sexual abuse. At that time, charging someone for incest was so unusual “they didn’t even know how to word the charges”, she said. Reo’s stepdad spent five years behind bars for his years of severe offending, which took place for 10 years when she was aged six to 16. She didn’t speak about it for decades. “I felt that if I’d gone public in those days, that I would have been seen as a nutcase,” Reo said. “People were so unable to discuss their own sexuality, let alone confront little children being sexually abused.” At the time paedophilia was believed to be rare. But according to University of New South Wales research published today, there is nothing rare about the sexual abuse of children. Described by its authors as the largest study of its kind ever undertaken globally, the study, titled Identifying and understanding child sexual offending behaviour and attitudes among Australian men, surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,945 Australian men and found 9.4% said they had sexual contact with someone under the age of 18. That would equate to about one million Australian men. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The figure includes online offending such as those who reported to have had online sexual conversations with children (4.3%) or deliberately watched pornographic material containing people below the age of 18 (2.5%). The study found 3.2% of men said they had had sexual contact with a person below the age of 18 when they were over 18. The age of consent in Australia is 16 or 17, depending on the state, which researchers admit is a limitation of the study which was set up to align with international surveys. However, they said the rate of contact was consistent with other studies worldwide. “People really need to ask themselves, we’ve got so many victims in the community, we’ve got so many lives that are impacted by child sexual abuse, but we have comparatively few men in prison for this offence. So who’s responsible for all of this damage?” asked Michael Salter, an associate professor in criminology at UNSW, who helped develop the study. “And that’s what our survey’s highlighting.” The report found nearly one in six men (15.1%) had sexual feelings towards under 18s. It reported that child offenders are also prolific consumers of deviant or violent adult pornography, signalling to Salter that “the overall porn-saturated online environment does have a role to play in sexual harm to children”. “Unfortunately, the commonwealth government has kicked the can down the road when it comes to age verification for adult content, and I think our survey signals [the] need to revisit that decision.” The findingsadd to groundbreaking research into victimsof child abuse published in April. The landmark Australian child maltreatment study found that about 23.7% of Australians had experienced child sexual abuse; about 8.7% had been forced into sex. More than one in three Australian girls experience child sexual abuse, it found. The UNSW research found two distinct cohorts of child sex offenders: “One which is motivated by sexual interest in children, and a second group who may be offending for situational or opportunistic reasons.” It also revealed the existence of a large group of undetected men who Salter called “specialist” offenders: otherwise pro-social, well-liked, high status men who repeatedly groom and then abuse children without detection. The study showed they tend to have higher incomes, are more likely to be married and are more likely to work in a field giving them access to kids. He said governments – and social media providers – need to do more to uncover their offending. Sign up to Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “We have commercial products that are actively facilitating child sexual exploitation,” he said. The study also found that perpetrators were also more likely to have been themselves the victim of sexual abuse or had adverse experiences as a child, to have anxiety, depression and binge drinking. Stop It Now! Australia, the country’s only helpline for people sexually attracted to children, helped develop the study. It found that about one-third of men with sexual feelings towards children wanted help. Georgia Naldrett, clinical manager at the helpline, called for governments to invest in initiatives that address boys and men who report “troubling thoughts and behaviours”. Now 77, Reo spent years fighting for compensation even after proving the offending took place. She said the offending had lifelong deleterious effects on her, but urged victims to seek therapeutic support and guidance. “You can get through it, and you can live a normal life. You can get it into perspective to the point where … you don’t relive it and … you’re not having nightmares any more,” she said.

479,Guardian,UK media MPs want national security law used to vet Barclay family’s Telegraph offer7h ago,Julia Kollewe,"A group of Conservative MPs have written to the government asking it to use the UK’s national security laws to investigate the Barclay family’s attempt to regain control of the Telegraph newspaper group with funding from Abu Dhabi.MPs, including Edward Leigh, John Hayes and the life peer Margaret Eaton, have written to the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, and the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, questioning the use of overseas sovereign wealth to buy Telegraph Media Group,the Financial Times reported. The Barclays had owned the group, which includes the Daily and Sunday Telegraph as well as the Spectator,since 2004but Lloyds Banking Group took control of it in June after the family failed to reach an agreement over more than £1bn in unpaid debt. It has since been put up for sale by the bank in an auction run by Goldman Sachs. Last month, the Barclay family tabled an offer valuing the newspaper group at £1bn in an attempt to deter rival bidders from challenging thembefore the auction. The family has secured financing from investors based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, aftertalks that began in August. The MPs said in the letter that they were concerned that investment vehicles with links to the UAE royal family “may soon gain control of or material influence over two of the most important media publications in Great Britain, the Telegraph and the Spectator”. They argued that there “is a strong case for close scrutiny by the government under both the Enterprise Act 2002 and the National Security and Investment Act 2021”, especially if the offer involved taking the publications as security for the loan, “an amount which, by any sensible measure, the revenue of the publications will not be able to support”.The MPs said in the letter: “Material influence over a quality national newspaper being passed to a foreign ruler at any time should raise concerns, but given the current geopolitical context, such a deal must be investigated. Clearly, this represents a potential threat to press freedom in this country, and given the position of influence that these publications hold, a risk of issues pertaining to national security not being reported accurately.” The MPs said that the Barclay family deal could be investigated through a public interest intervention notice but the family pushed back against this. In a statement, they said: “The Barclay family’s proposal to Lloyds Banking Groupconcerns the settlement of outstanding loans. There is no precedent and no basis for a PIIN being issued in relation to a debt transaction, and we are highly confident that the family’s proposal would not trigger any regulatory reviews regarding the ownership of the media assets.

480,Guardian,Brazil Bolsonaro under investigation for ‘harassing’ humpback whale11h ago,Tom Phillips,"Federal police are investigating Brazil’s former president,Jair Bolsonaro, for yet another suspected misdeed: “harassing” a humpback whale while taking a public holiday spin on his jetski. Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental policies earned him the nickname“Captain Chainsaw”during a four-year administration characterised by soaring destruction of the Amazon. But the far-right ex-president’s latest suspected environmental offencereportedlyoccurred in the waters off Brazil’s south-eastern coastline near the town of São Sebastião. It was there in June that a man resembling Bolsonaro was seemingly spotted –and filmed– about 15 metres from a humpback whale that had surfaced. “The man, thought to be Bolsonaro, was shooting a video with a mobile phone as the whale performed aerial behaviours suggesting distress or discomfort,” the news website i Greported. Brazilian legislation outlaws “the deliberate harassment of any species of cetacean” such as dolphins or humpback whales, which are called baleias jubarte in the South American country. According torulesenforced by the environmental agency Ibama, vessels with their engines running must not come within 100 metres of such animals. Seafarers are also forbidden from chasing or invading the space of pods of dolphins or whales, or making “excessive noise – such as music, any kind of percussion or other [sounds] … within 300 metres of any cetacean”. Another rightwing politician wasrecently fined2,500 reais (£410) for committing a similar offence in the same region. Just over a decade ago, Bolsonaro himself was fined for illegal fishing within a marine reserve off the Rio de Janeiro coastline. As president, critics accused him of deliberately dismantling environmental protections withcatastrophic consequences for nature. One year after losing power, Bolsonaro is facing a multitude of investigations into suspected crimes, including plotting a coup against his leftwing successor,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, misappropriating expensive jewels and faking Covid vaccination records. Some believe the politician, who has been banned from seeking election until 2030, could eventually end up in jail. On Saturday, the ex-president dismissed the humpback whale inquiry as another example of political persecution from Brazilian politicians and environmentalists. “Every day they accuse me of some kind of mischief. Yesterday it was hounding whales,” Bolsonaro told supporters, before making a disparaging remark about Brazil’s justice minister, Flávio Dino, whom he likened to a whale. Bolsonaro supporters made fun of the aquatic allegations on social media, with one claiming the humpback must have been a fan of the former president who stopped him to request a selfie.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 15.45 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0

483,Guardian,"UKScientists set to expose chaos and disagreement in government at Covid inquiry The Eat out to help out scheme will face scrutiny when Patrick Vallance, Chris Whitty and Angela Mc Lean appear this week",Toby Helm,"Explosive evidence about thetensions and disagreementsbetween the then prime minister Boris Johnson, his ministers and the country’s top scientific advisers at key moments during the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be made public this week at the official inquiry into the crisis. On Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s former chief scientific adviser – whose incendiary private diary entries are being quoted selectively at the inquiry – will give evidence at an all-day session on Monday that looks certain to cast new light on the chaos in government as the virus swept across the globe. Vallance will be followed in the witness box by the other top scientists who flanked ministers at the televised daily Covid press conferences. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, will make an all-day appearance on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the former deputy chief medical officer, and the current chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela Mc Lean – who described the-then chancellor Rishi Sunakas “Dr Death”in the weeks following the Treasury- inspired “eat out to help out” scheme in August 2020 – will appear before the inquiry. One of the issues that is certain to be explored is whether the scientists were adequately consulted at key moments, including about theeat out to help outscheme, in which the public were offered a discount on restaurant bills to encourage them to eat out. The inquiry is also likely to examine whether the scientists found themselves under political pressure to toe the line as part of the government team, with the result that the true extent of the dangers that they knew existed was not conveyed to the public. One former government minister with knowledge of the Covid threat at the time said: “In the early days, there was a political imperative not to overstate or overreact. “These scientists were not accustomed to finding themselves in Downing Street, alongside politicians at televised press conferences,” the minister said. “They will obviously have felt under pressure and couched what they said. That was certainly an issue.” One potentially difficult area for the scientists could be evidence that has already emerged which suggests that they had on several occasions seemed to have been stronger in their warnings about the Covid pandemic in private than they were in public. It has already emerged that Dominic Cummings,Johnson’s former chief adviser, told a No 10 aides’ Whats App group on 6 February 2020 that Vallance had just said to him that the virus was “probably out of control now and will sweep the world”. However, on 25 February 2020, Whitty and Vallance had briefed journalists saying that data from China suggested it was still possible to contain the virus. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Vallance added: “We’ve always taken the view that this may either be containable or it may not.” Oneextract from Vallance’s pandemic diarythat was released to the inquiry read: “Number 10 chaos as usual. On Friday, the two-metre rule meeting made it abundantly clear that no one in Number 10 or the Cabinet Office had really read or taken time to understand the science advice on two metres. Quite extraordinary.” Vallance and Whitty said in their original witness statements that “had they been consulted” on the eat out to help out scheme at the time, they would have advised against it because they suspected that it would increase transmission of Covid-19 at a crucial time in the fight to control the virus in the UK.",Unknown,,,
484,Guardian,"Egypt My brother the political prisoner, by Sanaa Seif12h ago",Sanaa Seif,"At 9am, my mother, aunt and I piled into a car and headed out towards the modern prison complex deep in the desert. We sat in silence – there was nothing to say. Pulling up to the compound, we all knew the drill: jump out, show officials our documents and then sit around for hours and hours. The wait that day felt especially anxious. Days previously, our family had received two short handwritten notes from Alaa, which proved he was alive. The first letter stated he was drinking water again. The second that he was eating, too, and that on our visit we should bring a birthday cake. A few days later, he’d be turning 41. For hours, my mum and aunt had stressed about what type of cake to bring, but I refused to engage. All I could focus on was how we’d failed to free him. Just 500km away, in Sharm el-Sheikh, world leaders were meeting for Cop27, the annual UN climate conference. Through the hard work of thousands of people, we’d managed to make Alaa’s imprisonment a major international news story to coincide with it. The world’s attention was on my brother, and I felt as if he’d given in too soon. That he had no idea, behind bars, how close we might have been to getting him out and that the authorities offered him a few tiny things – to listen to music, access to sunlight, some vague promise to re-evaluate his case – and in exchange he called off his strikes and we’d lost our leverage. We’d given in for less than Alaa’s freedom. Midafternoon, we were taken to the visitation room, empty except for security guards dressed in riot gear. Months had passed since I’d last seen my brother. Alaa was thin, his cheekbones protruding far more than they should, his eyes popping out from his face. The way he spoke, however, was gentle and soothing. The visit lasted half an hour. He described a near-death experience: after days of no water and months of no food, he’d been incredibly unwell. He’d collapsed in the bathroom. Waking up on the floor, he was put on drips. Then, out of nowhere, he was hearing music – for the first time in three years. Pink Floyd’s Comfortably Numb. An officer had played the song in the hope of bringing him round. He talked to us about our family. His son. Our pregnant sister. He was very emotional. At the end, we were briefly allowed to hug – our first embrace in three years. I felt how frail he was. As I held him, something softened in my mind. Pushed to the brink, I’d become so focused on my strategy to get him out that I’d forgotten Alaa’s humanity. In that moment, all I could feel was gratitude that he was alive. I’m the youngestof three siblings; Alaa is the oldest. Because of the 12-year age difference, he was both a sibling and a parent figure to me growing up. He took me to museums, concerts, sculpting lessons and break-dancing classes. As a kid, I had a habit of opening up electronic devices to see what was inside – our mum wasn’t best pleased when I dissected the washing machine. When I got my first laptop, Alaa sat with me and together we explored within. He’s not just my brother, but a friend and mentor. I miss his advice and his friendship. The other day, I went to see the new Scorsese movie and I kept thinking how much he’d have enjoyed it. I have a list of movies, TV shows and music that he’s missed in the last nine years waiting for him. The fight for Alaa’s freedom began in 2011. Since then, family, friends and many others have been relentless. Last year, we decided to focus our efforts on the international community, instead of on domestic campaigning. With Egypthosting Cop27, the Egyptian government had an opportunity to clean up their image in front of a global audience. It was a huge PR opportunity and we needed to convince politicians to bring up Alaa’s case, ensuring that smiling for the camera alongside the Egyptian president was contingent on the release of political prisoners. I’ve been imprisoned three times – and my mum and sister assaulted – for campaigning for my brother’s release. My family’s ordeal is not unique – there are tens of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt. But we know that putting pressure on the authorities can work, which is how I made it out of prison myself the most recent time in 2021. Following my most recent release, I took the book of essays my brother had written while in prison,You Have Not Yet Been Defeated, on an international tour. I met activists, journalists, politicians and diplomats to generate support. Each time, I told our story – my brother is a British-Egyptian software developer and writer imprisoned for the ideas in this book. He was prominent during the Arab Spring as a pro-democracy activist, his voice resonating with people across the region. The Egyptian authorities worry he’ll become a Nelson Mandela figure when he’s released. That’s nonsense. He’s just a father, with a son on the spectrum, who desperately wants to be a present parent; a techie kept offline waiting to rebuild his career. Support for our campaign grew, but though we are British citizens, the UK government wasn’t moving. I decided to make myself impossible to ignore, and, in October last year, pitched a tent on Whitehall outside the Foreign Office. I spent 20 days living there while Alaa escalated his hunger strike. It’s then that we started to get real attention. Alaa was in newspapers worldwide and I was invited on to television and radio shows. It was a relief, but also exhausting. None of this comes naturally to me. I’m an introvert, so I hate the spotlight and photos. When my brother heard I was doing public advocacy, he wrote to me, asking: Sanaa, is it that bad? As Cop27 began, I flew to Egypt. It’s all a blur of interviews, meetings, speeches and events. For five nights, I barely slept. There was a single apple in my bag, which I spent 48 hours nibbling. I’ve no idea how I managed to get through that period. My solace was climate activists and human rights groups – we planned and strategised together. They shared my burden as if it was their own. In the most difficult times for my family, it’s solidarity from people around the world that has given us hope. In the company of politicians though, I felt helpless. Those in power – the ones who could easily change the course of Alaa’s life – have endless ways of telling you there’s nothing they can do. On 5 November last year, Rishi Sunak wrote to me: “We are totally committed to resolving your brother’s case… Ministers and officials continue to press for urgent consular access to Alaa as well as calling for his release.”It’s clear that isn’t happening. Alaa’s release date is set for January 2027. That’s three more years of my brother’s life stolen from him. Just maybe, this story will help remind the prime minister of his pledge to us a year ago. Most of the letters between Alaa and me now are us joking about how I’m living his life while he sits in prison. I can’t wait for him to get out and take over. Alaa’s 13-year-old son lives in Brighton: he’s building a life there, while waiting for his dad. My sister lives in London – she’s just had her first child. I’m based in London, too, but since my release I’ve been in limbo, living out of a suitcase. I’ve not yet had the space to put down roots. All that will wait until Alaa has his freedom. Our mum is in Cairo. Every week she delivers food, laundry, letters and books to the prison. Once a month she’s allowed to see him for 20 minutes behind a glass barrier. And every couple of months, she’s allowed a hug. Sometimes I wake up terrified that this might be what our lives look like forever. It can be hard to believe a situation is “temporary” when it’s lasted nine years. At times, normal life feels like a distant memory. Alaa was always protective of me when I was younger. In our letters, he always writes how he struggles to think of me now as a 30-year-old woman. His world has been paused; in his head, I’m still that kid sister. Now it’s me trying to look out for him. That really affects my brother – he thinks that it’s unfair on me. But I know he’d do the same for me; it’s just what you do for your family.

485,Guardian,Magic touch How ‘revolutionary’ changes are making braille better than ever12h ago,Maddie Thomas,"Blind from birth, Graeme Innes can’t remember the last time he sat down to read a book in braille. Instead, he listens to audiobooks.Yet Innes, who is Australia’s former disability discrimination commissioner, and Vision Australia’s first chair, still uses braille every day. To seeing eyes, braille reads like an indecipherable morse code. Invented by Louis Braille in 1824, the 64 character script, made up of a matrix of six dots, was developed as a means of efficient communication for blind people. By the 2000s, however, the advance of technology led many to believe that braille would become redundant; teaching braille declined and many vision-impaired young people did not learn it. But braille has had a revival during the past decade. Technology such as refreshable braille displays has made the script more portable and adaptable, and increasingly braille is being integrated into the community beyond books. For braille advocates, there is no substitute for braille when it relates to the literacy and communication skills of the vision-impaired. “Everything I do is based on braille,” Innes says. “I have an Apple Watch – now, that speaks to me. But I also always carry a braille watch because I don’t want the watch speaking to me, in certain circumstances, such as when I’m asleep.”Displaying the script by raising round-tipped pins up and down on a flat surface, a braille display is about the size of an i Pad mini but a bit thicker. Innes says the device has been “revolutionary” since becoming mainstream in the mid-2000s. While technology is an aid, he says, recognition of the importance of braille for literacy is taking hold. “You get to a point in your career, and if you can’t write notes in braille, and interact with those notes while fully participating in meetings … you just can’t keep progressing,” Innes says. Lacking braille skills is something he says is easily recognisable to those who are blind, with a noticeable difference in the literacy, spelling and punctuation skills of those who are braille readers. In Australia, it is estimated that 453,000 people are blind or have low vision, but there are no solid statistics on braille literacy here. A study conducted by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in the UK in 2015 found that of the about 350,000 registered blind or vision impaired, 7% use braille. A report by the National Federation of the Blind in the US in 2009 found that only 10% of blind children learn to read braille.The reportestimated that at the height of its usage after beingintroduced as a universal code in 1932,50% of children learned to read and write in braille. Alongside technology bringing braille into a new age and audience, advocacy groups have secured access to braille in an increasing range of places and products.Recent moves have been made to continue integrating braille fromcredit cardstobraille lego. It is now found on many every day products, including medication packaging, signage, and there is braille software installed on Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon devices. In Hong Kong, ferry terminals are known for having tactile maps, and Japan’s tenji blocks – or tactile paving – are widespread on many roads and at train stations. In 2016,the city of Sydney installed braille on 2,100 street signs in the council area, something that Innes said would be a “wonderful” standard to see everywhere. Vision Australia emphasises the importance of using braille, audio or other technology in tandem, as “complementary, not competing ways of accessing information”. Recently, a UV printer has provided the charity with opportunities to work with the Art Gallery of NSW, reproducing work from the Archibald prize as tactile materials to make an environment that is typically guarded by “don’t touch” signs more engaging for blind people. “It was the first time I went to an art gallery and I didn’t get bored halfway through because either things weren’t being described to me adequately or I couldn’t touch anything,” says Kirsten Busby, a blind proofreader at Vision Australia. “I was able to touch the artwork and I was able to be engaged as a sighted person would be.” Bringing people together through experiences is central to UK library Clear Vision’s mission. Since 1985, a small team has been taking conventional children’s picture books and adding braille on a clear plastic sheet, bound back into the original book. The result is a story that can be read concurrently by a blind and sighted person. “There’s nothing that’s commercially produced that contains both print and braille together. And that’s a problem,” says Alex Britton, director at the Clear Vision Project. “If you’re a braille-reading adult, who’s got sighted kids or grandchildren … you can read to them from a braille book, or from a refreshable braille display but that’s not exciting for a three or four-year-old who wants to watch, see the pictures and be snuggled up on your lap to turn the pages.” Vision Australia is also trying to bridge this gap, this year publishing their own picture book series,Big Visions, about historical Australian figures, which is now a part of their library collection in Kooyong, Victoria. The library, which operates in person, online and by post, has a 45,000 title strong library of DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System) or talking books, plus more than 8,000 braille titles, many of which can be downloaded in e-braille. And it is not only books that are increasingly becoming accessible but the libraries they are held in. In 2020 the National Library of Australia in Canberrabecame Bindi Mapped in 2020, allowing those with vision impairment to easily navigate the building and resources via an audio guided app.For braille-reader Dave Williams, it is those small things that make a big difference, particularly when integrating braille into the community. “I went on a cruise with Royal Caribbean and they put braille on their handrails on the staircase, like underneath, so your fingers curled around the handrail, you discovered the braille.” And in 2021, after crossing the finish line of London Marathon, Williams found braille on the medal hung around his neck for the first time. “It said, ‘We run together’, and I could read it. It wasn’t somebody reading it to me,” he says. “Being able to do that yourself, I think, is quite powerful.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 15.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
486,Guardian,"Bedsit Britain160,000 people in England crammed into unlicensed housing11h ago‘I get so depressed’Forced to live in a London bedsit with 13 to a bathroom",Tom Wall,"Nearly 160,000 people are living in hidden, often overcrowded and sometimes dangerous bedsit-style accommodation across England, analysis has found. Intelligence compiled by councils suggests there are almost 32,000 unlicensed large houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). These are believed to be home to at least 159,340 tenants, who are often drawn by cheaper rents amid the cost of living crisis. Conditions can be dire, with examples of more than 10 people sharing a single bathroom,squalid conditionsand little protection in place should a fire break out. Landlords have doubled their borrowing to invest in HMOs since 2018. A landlord renting to a single family can expect to generate 5% of the property’s value in annual rent, whereas a licensed HMO typically produces about 7.5%, and in some cases 10%. Profits in unlicensed bedsits are likely to be even higher, as landlords can cram in more tenants and do not have to comply with licensing standards. The analysis on the rise of “bedsit Britain” is part of the Guardian’s Living Hell series, focusing on the rented private sector. Based on local authority statistics submitted to the government between 2011 and 2022, the estimated number of larger hidden bedsits – those that accommodate more than five unrelated people sharing bathrooms and kitchens – has increased by 46% in the past 10 years in England. There is no oversight of occupancy rates, fire safety measures or other living conditions in unlicensed shared properties. Large HMOs require a licence in England but smaller ones only require a licence in some parts of the country. The most recent estimates suggest there are more than 367,000 smaller bedsits in England, with a population of at least 1 million. Southend in Essex, which the Guardian’s analysis suggests has more than 670 bedsits operating below the radar of the council’s housing enforcement team, has prosecuted two landlords for operating unlicensed HMOs this year, exposing the profits that can be made by cramming people into poorly maintained buildings. One landlordcharged18 tenants a total of more than £5,800 a month for 11 rooms in a squalid, rat-infested former hotel with no working kitchen, unusable toilets, a faulty gas supply, blocked drains and partly blocked fire escapes. Another landlordcollected£5,480 a month for a mouldy, overcrowded property with no heating, limited fire escape access and cooking appliances installed next to sofas. The 11 rooms were let to 16 adults and five children, with some families sharing a single room. Southend council said there appeared to have been an increase in the number of HMOs in the seaside city, with enforcement officers working to ensure they had planning permission and met housing standards. Haringey, in north London, which has issued 43 fines to landlords running unlicensed HMOs since May 2021, said officers were uncovering accommodation where three or four people, or sometimes whole families, shared a single room. “It’s not just single adults. We see couples with babies living in single rooms in HMOs. It is not uncommon,” said Sarah Williams, Haringey’s cabinet member for housing. “It makes me very angry. The level of this problem needs central government intervention. We have to regulate and control the rental market.” The borough, which has about 22,000 people living in 5,000 HMOs, has seen an increase in HMO conversions. Last year there was a near 20% increase in the number of planning applications to turn family homes into HMOs compared with the average over the previous five years. Williams said landlords who had traditionally signed contracts with the council to provide emergency homeless accommodation were now moving into the private HMO market to take advantage of higher rents. “We are being priced out of the market,” she said. Family homes are still being lost in many parts of the country, despite councils bringing in planning restrictions to halt the spread of HMOs. Nigel Wicks, who carries out investigations and appears at planning hearings for councils across the country, said some developers went ahead without permission and persisted whether or not they got approval. “Where rewards are extremely high for minimal investment, developers are ahead of the game and local planning authorities struggle to keep up,” he said. He frequently saw people, including children, living in substandard conditions. “Only last week I attended a property, meant to provide a three-bedroom family home, that was divided into nine units, three in the basement, without natural light … At least one unit, measuring less than 30 square metres with a headroom of less than 2 metres, was occupied by a couple with a child,” he said. The wider HMO market has expanded in recent years. According to UK Finance, the banking industry body, lending to buy HMOs more than doubled between 2018 and 2022, from £310m to £683m. The Department for Levelling Up,Housingand Communities said it was determined to crack down on rogue landlords. “We have put measures in place that make it easier for councils to effectively tackle unlicensed HMOs, introducing civil penalties of up to £30,000 and rent repayment orders for a wide range of offences,” it said.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 16.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
487,Guardian,A new model for digital media?What Karlie Kloss’s acquisition of i-D means,Unknown,"In 2006, the then 25-year-old real estate heir Jared Kushnerboughtthe New York Observer – and went on to own it formore than a decade. Almost 20 years later, Kushner’s sister-in-law, the supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss,bought the British fashion publication i-Dfrom Vice Media Group, months after the companyfiled for bankruptcy. Kloss’s acquisition of i-D through her media company, Bedford Media, comes three years after she and a group of other high-profile investors including herfellow model Kaia Gerber bought W magazine. The 2006 and 2023 sales of the Observer and i-D – from two very different people who are, coincidentally, members of the same family – reflect a steady evolution in the stewardship and direction of journalism and digital media amid years of uncertainty. Where we’ve often seen billionaires andprivate equitytake ownership of media outlets, we’re now, too, seeing supermodels such as Kloss and Gerber pivot to invest in media themselves. “What’s happening is that people with the means are finding things they care about and deciding to rework them so they stay alive, and it’s not just traditional businessmen with the means any more,” said Karen North, a professor of communication at USC’s Annenberg School for Journalism and Communication. North drew a comparison to the recentrevival of Toys R Us after the retailer shuttered in 2018: “We’re seeing new things come along – the entrepreneurs from different walks of life, from different areas of industry, looking to see whether there’s a way to, instead of to start with a startup, take something that already exists, that already has enjoyed a certain amount of success, guide it into a new direction.” Instability within the media industry has often been met with intervention from wealthy, high-profile businesspeople dressed as benefactors. Kloss’s recent purchase of i-D, as a fashion industry icon now breaking into fashion media, reflects a diversification of who these ostensible benefactors are, at a time when media companies are gasping for air. At the Observer, Kushner reportedly oversaw the magazine with a heavy hand, allegedlyexerting significant control over editorial operations. He departed in 2017 and joined the Trump administration. It’s not immediately clear how Kloss will wield her powers as CEO of i-D, but her decision to acquire the fashion and art magazine speaks to the possible allure of investing in media as a demonstration of status and taste. Daisy Alioto, who founded the blockchain-based company Dirt Media as a counter to the financial struggles of traditional digital media in 2020, sees callbacks to the Renaissance in a business deal like Kloss’s purchase of i-D. “It reminds me of this very old thing, which is patronage. This old concept, where when people attain a certain level of wealth, there’s only so many things you can buy, and if you have an inclination towards art and entertainment, it makes sense that you would enter some form of patronage around that, not just for profit,” Alioto said. A memo from Vice Media Group on the i-D salesaid Kloss had “deep roots in the fashion industry and has established herself as an entrepreneur who has a vision for the future of i-D and the industry at large.” Kloss, who runs Kode With Klossy to offer free coding camps to girls, “has a deep passion for technology and the intersection of fashion, media, and culture on a global basis”, it continued. Influencers, models and celebrities more generally have been pursuing business endeavors for years, and, as Alioto sees it, every one of their companies is “already a media company”. Take Kendall Jenner’s tequila brand or her sister Kylie’s cosmetic brand, or even how, Alioto points out,Glossier started as a blog: “It’s their celebrity, their branding, their media that people are buying, it’s why someone would buy 818 instead of another tequila,” she explained. “We’re entering a period where, in a sense, media is struggling astronomically – but it’s also never been more powerful as an idea.” The pivot by celebrities to owning and running media companies isn’t such a leap from Jenner launching 818, or Dua Lipa starting her newsletter/book club Service95. “We’re going to see more people [like Kloss] positioning themselves as patrons of media, because media takes curation, it’s about tastemaking more, maybe, than traffic scale, proprietary data,” said Alioto. That someone like Kloss would take the reins of i-D makes more sense as the publication becomes an extension of her media image and legacy. A unique aspect of digital media, North said, was “that we feel like we have these personal relationships with people, even when we don’t, through the internet, we feel a connection”. When those we feel connected to “take the reins of something, the audience can feel more connected with that product, service, or organization.” Unexpected lifelines may be the only future for beloved or niche outlets and magazines. Writers ranging from veteran journalists to tastemaking influencers are monetizing Substacks and Patreons. Alioto’s Dirt is pioneering andexperimenting with new financial pathsfor publishing through NFTs and the blockchain. And there’s worker-owned media like Defector Media, founded and staffed byformer Deadspin writers who resigned in protestof the private equity-owned G/O Media after it directed them to “stick to sports” amid the Trump presidency in 2019. Defector has maintained a devoted readership since it opened in July 2020, generating $4.5m in revenue over 2023 up from $3.8m in 2022. “Three years in, we’ve shown that we can satisfy the base conditions within the hierarchy of professional needs,” the company wrote in a 2024report. “Those conditions are hard to come by in the media industry, we’re proud to have achieved them, and we absolutely don’t take them for granted.” It’s an “interesting time” for digital media, between worker-run publications, new financial models like Dirt Media, or fashion industry icons like Kloss swooping in to save a beloved publication like i-D from its bankrupt parent company, North said. And, she added, it’s only going to get more interesting: “The creativity of the digital age, the eagerness for partnerships, collaborations – there’s a growing sense that there’s more ways to be successful, and be successful together.”",Unknown,,,
488,Guardian,Cambodia How a sleepy town won a place on Unesco’s culinary map,Lara Dunston,"“Batdambng mean avei chhnganh? Anything delicious in Battambang?” crooned popular Cambodian singer-songwriter Sinn Sisamouth in his song of the same name. For Cambodians, everything is delicious in Battambang and now, much to their delight, Unesco agrees. A quiet provincial capital in north-west Cambodia that feels like a big country town, Battambang has been named a city of gastronomy by Unescoand is one of 55 places added to it Creative Cities Network of destinations known for crafts and folk art, design, film, gastronomy, literature, media arts and music. Yet no Battambang restaurant has ever appeared on a global where to eat list and the city doesn’t have a single fine-dining space presided over by with a hot young creative chef. (They’re in Siem Reap.) The closest thing it has to a fine dining restaurant is Jaan Bai, which means “rice bowl” in Khmer, a stylish bistro and bar launched a decade ago by renowned Australian chef David Thompson. What Battambang does have are rich culinary traditions and a reputation for producing the country’s most delicious food: flavourful fruit and vegetables and award-winning rice; artisanal products such as fresh rice noodles and rice paper made as they’ve always been made; and tasty street food and traditional fare sold at markets, roadside stalls and rustic eateries. Representatives of Battambang’s tourism and culture authorities, who applied to join the Creative Cities Network in 2021, hope Unesco’s city of gastronomy designation will establish Battambang – pronounced Bad-tam-bong – as a destination for foodies. “For Cambodian people, Battambang province is well known for its food,” Yong Yi, who is in charge of Battambang’s tourist information centre and social media, said. “Battambang food is famous in Cambodia, but not only for its taste.Foodis closely related to the culture of Battambangers, such as the many songs about Battambang by our best Cambodian singer Sinn Sisamouth.” The province of Battambang is Cambodia’s rice bowl, widely loved for its fertile soils; its picturesque countryside dotted with lofty sugar palms and traditional timber houses; and its lush rice fields where farmers cultivate the famedphka rumdoulvariety of fragrant jasmine rice – crowned the world’s best rice last year for the fifth time. The city’s cuisine is best sampled on a stroll around its exuberant markets, with stops for snacks such as crunchy deep-fried bananas speckled with black and white sesame seeds, and piping-hot coconut custard puddings cooked on clay braziers by smiling women in mismatched floral pyjamas or bespectacled men in pork-pie hats. Visitors who have a local as their food tour guide can slurp freshly made rice noodles doused in herbaceous curries at boisterous locals-only breakfast eateries, perch on plastic stools at street-side stalls selling fresh spring rolls, turmeric-tinted minced-pork stuffed pancakes, and smoky grilled beef skewers tucked into baguettes, or even score an invitation for a home-cooked feast of traditional countryside fare. Kim Nou, owner of boutique hotel Maisons Wat Kor welcomed the recognition from Unesco. “Of course I am so proud of Battambang. For Cambodians, Battambang is very well known as having the best food,” he says. “Now we hope people outside the country will start to know Battambang for its gastronomy. This a good start for Battambang.” Sign up to Feast Recipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews. Get our best food writing every week after newsletter promotion Tour guide Sokin Nou (no relation to Kim) splits her time between her Battambang birthplace and tourist hotspot Siem Reap, where she is an archaeological guide leading as many excursions to markets, villages and farms as she does to Angkor temples. The 25-year-old foodie and history buff was one of the first to guide foreigners on proper culinary tours in Battambang. “Battambang has so much more to offer than popular tourist experiences like the bamboo train and the bat cave,” she says. “The way locals prepare food for you is the way they cook it at home.” Arun Ham of Battambang’s provincial tourism department agrees. Along with Kim Nou, he was closely involved in preparing the Unesco application. “Battambang’s food is so tasty and so famous in Cambodia that some foods that are sold in other cities and provinces use the name of Battambang,” he says. “But Cambodian food is not yet widely known. We hope that the Unesco designation will put Battambang city on the map.” Sokin Nou agrees. “I think locals will be more encouraged now to continue to preserve our food traditions. Battambang is close to Thailand, so some people think that our food is more like Thai food, but actually it’s not. We have our own Battambang style of food, that I can say inspired the Thais but was also inspired from them, because we can’t deny that food travels with people. “Right now all I want to do is return to Battambang, to visit my family, and to eat,” she says. “I miss Battambang food so badly.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 11.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
489,Guardian,Where did they all go?How Homo sapiens became the last human species left……,Unknown,"Just 300,000 years ago – a blink in evolutionary time – at least nine species of humans wandered the planet. Today, only our own,Homo sapiens, remains. And this raises one of the biggest questions in the story of human evolution: where did everyone else go? “It’s not a coincidence that several of them disappeared around the time that Homo sapiensstarted to spread out of Africa and around the rest of the world,” says Prof Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. “What we don’t know is if that was a direct connection.” There are many theories around the disappearance of our human cousins, and limited evidence to decipher exactly what happened. But recent studies are providing tantalising clues. What we do know is that from about 40,000 years ago,Hsapienswas the last human standing out of a large and diverse group of bipedal hominins. Hypotheses range from benign, such as Hsapienshaving better infant survival rates than other hominins, or climate changes pushing other species to the brink. Others suggest a more active role, such as Hsapienshunting other humans or interbreeding with them and assimilating their genetics. About 300,000 years ago, the first Hsapienspopulations were springing up in Africa. They didn’t look like modern humans, but they are more similar to us than other Homospecies. They had tall, rounded skulls with an almost vertical forehead. They didn’t have the glowering brows of Neanderthals(Homo neanderthalensis)or the protruding jaw of archaic-looking species such as Homo naledi. They also had chins; something that no other Homospecies has had (although we don’t know why only Hsapienshas the protuberance). Astudy published in Naturethis year exploded the idea that Hsapiensoriginated from a single place in Africa in one great evolutionary leap. By analysing the genomes of 290 people, the researchers showed that Hsapiensdescended from at least two populations that lived in Africa for 1m years, before merging in several interactions. Palaeoanthropologists continue to argue (quite vociferously) over who the last ancestor of H Sapienswas, but so far there is no conclusive evidence.Also, there is no single origin for Hsapiens. There are ancient remains of early Hsapiensin Jebel Irhoud in Morocco, Omo Kibish in Ethiopia and Florisbad in South Africa, suggesting that our species arose from multiple sites. When Hsapiensmoved out of Africa is also the subject of debate. Genetic evidence suggests there was a big foray out of the continent between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago. But it was not the first expedition. A perplexing Hsapiensskull in Apidima in Greece has been dated to beingat least 210,000 years old. We know of several other Homogroups that existed alongside Hsapiensbetween 300,000 and 100,000 years ago. Some were quite similar to Hsapiens. Stocky Neanderthals endured Europe’s chilly weather andthe mysterious Denisovanseked out an existence in the rarefied air of what is now Siberia and Tibet, and possibly further afield. Homo erectus, the long-legged “cosmopolitan” species – so called because of the impressive geographical range it spanned – still wandered through parts of Indonesia;Homo longi(also known as the “Dragon man”) lived in China.Homorhodesiensis(also known as Homobodoensisor Homoheidelbergensis– scientists continue todebate its name and membership) was alive in central and southern Africa. Other species were rather distinct from us:Hnaledi,with its ape-size brain, rambled through the woody grasslands of South Africa, and the diminutive Homo floresiensisand Homo luzonensislived, breathed and died on the islands of Flores and Luzon in Indonesia and the Philippines respectively. “Hominin species were likely dying out all the time,” says Prof Eleanor Scerri, head of the human palaeosystems group at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany. “It’s probably unusual that we are still around.” For most ancient human species, the fossil record is sparse.Hnalediindividuals, for example, are only found at a single site in South Africa. Some of the other species are known only by a handful of individuals. In Africa, where Hsapiensfirst emerged, there are surprisingly few Homofossils. “We don’t have a very good understanding of what other hominins were on the landscape in Africa with Hsapiensyet,” says Scerri. However, there is a plethora of data about Neanderthals, including full genomes extracted from bones. These close relatives roamed Eurasia until about 40,000 years ago, living in small groups. Scientists know significantly less about the Denisovans, but what they do know has reshuffled our understanding of human origins. In 2008, in the Denisova cave in Siberia, Russian archaeologists found several hominin bone fragments,including a finger boneand part of a toe. The cold weather had preserved some of the DNA in the finger bone, which yielded the full genome of this previously unknown species. From Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, researchers have inferred that they lived in small groups and frequently interbred.Some population estimates, based on mitochondrial DNA (inherited maternally), suggest that at their most abundant there were about 52,000 Neanderthals in Eurasia before they began to decline. Others suspect that there could have been between20,000 and 50,000 individuals. An important advantage that our direct ancestors appear to have had was population size. “Because of those small population sizes [among Neanderthals and Denisovans], there was a lot more interbreeding and the genetics reflects that,” says Scerri. The lack of genetic diversity would have rendered these populations more susceptible to diseases and thus less likely to survive. Hsapiens, by comparison, had larger groups and greater genetic diversity. The consequences of this extend beyond fitness against disease. “In Hsapiens, we see larger social networks extending across the wider landscape,” says Stringer. “Having wide networks gives you an insurance policy because if you’re related to people a bit further away, if there is an environmental crisis – you’re running out of food or water – you can move into their environments and they’re not enemies, they’re your kin.” Such networks also allow for the exchange of ideas and innovation, Stringer adds. This social resilience could have helped Hsapienssurvive climatic changes that would have killed off less adaptable individuals and species. A2022 study in Naturemodelled the ancient climates and ecosystems in which Herectus,Hheidelbergensisand Neanderthals lived and found that they lost significant portions of their environmental niches before disappearing. Alarger 2023 simulation, which included six Homospecies and the climate and vegetation over the past 3m years, found that later Homospecies were able to live in a wider range of habitats, particularly Hsapiens. Prof Axel Timmermann, a co-author of this study and director of the IBS Centre for Climate Physics in Busan, South Korea, believes that Hsapiensoutcompeted Neanderthals, ultimately leading to the latter’s demise. He built a numerical model,outlined in a 2020 paper, that simulated Hsapiens’s spread out of Africa and combined it with available food sources. Using this, he tested three hypotheses for the extinction of Neanderthals: that they were assimilated into Hsapiens; that there was a huge climate catastrophe; or that Hsapiensoutcompeted them. “It’s only the last one [competitive exclusion] that is able to contribute to a realistic extinction of Neanderthals,” Timmermann says. The model didn’t investigate what the specific competitive advantage may have been, although it could have included better tools, better offspring survival rates, or maybe even social hunting, he says. Stringer believes a number of small advantages allowed Hsapiensto outcompete its cousins. “We know now that Neanderthals were very capable, but maybe Hsapienswas just slightly more capable,” he says. Seemingly small innovations, such as weaving or sewing needles (both were known in the Hsapiensfossil record from 35,000 and 30,000 years ago respectively), could have tipped the scales in Hsapiens’sfavour, he says. “Once you weave, you can make baskets or snare nets… A sewing needle gives you a better seal [on materials], so you have better-insulated tents and you can keep your babies warm, which is of course critical for infant survival.” Larger social networks would also have allowed Hsapiensto share such innovations, he adds. Another possibility is that Hsapiensassimilated its cousins into the gene pool – and there is genetic evidence that this did happen, although whether it is responsible for the disappearance of the other species is still contentious. Some people currently living in Eurasia have up to 2% Neanderthal DNA. In fact,some geneticists claimthey can assemble about 40% of the Neanderthal genome from the sequences of living people. Meanwhile, populations in Oceania, which comprises Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia, havebetween 2% and 4% Denisovan DNA. Some groups have aneven higher percentage. There’s also the tantalising mystery of anunknown human ancestor, who contributed between 2% and 19% of their genetic ancestry to people living in west Africa today. In 2020, two researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles obtained the genomes of more than 400 people living in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia. They estimated that the ancient humans interbred with Hsapiensin the region at some point in the last 124,000 years. “This raises an important philosophical argument,” says Scerri. “Did they really die out, or are they still with us in some way?” Prof Rebecca Ackermann, co-director of the Human Evolution Research Institute at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, says that it depends on how you define species. This is the source of much debate among palaeoanthropologists: some recognise many species, while others acknowledge only a handful. “My take is that they probably weren’t distinct species,” she says, with the exception of obvious outliers such as small-brained Hnaledi. “We should really be talking about them as regional variants.” But some groups – whether a different species or not – definitely fared better than others, with our own direct forebears surviving. This is in large part because of luck and their behaviour, agree the experts I spoke to – and is something people living today need to recognise to overcome the challenges on the horizon. “Networking is important, the ability to adapt to change is important, and that’s certainly something we’re all going to face with climate change,” says Stringer. “Humanity will be faced with either cooperating in the face of those crises or competing. And what we see from Neanderthals and Hsapiensis that the groups that cooperated better were the ones that got through.” Sarah Wild is the author of Human Origins: AShort History, published by Michael O’Mara Books (£12.99).

490,Guardian,Operation Identify Me How Interpol traced the identity of ‘the woman with the flower tattoo’,Steven Morris,"For three decades, her body has lain far from the streets of Cardiffwhere she was known as a vibrant, kind-hearted, if troubled, young woman. Earlier this year, thanks to a groundbreaking cross-border operation, she was given an identity of sorts – the woman with the flower tattoo – as police teams across three European countries and the global law enforcement force Interpoltried to get to the bottom of her murder and 21 others. Now, finally, she has her real name back. The woman whose body was found nudging up against a gratein an Antwerp river in 1992 was Rita Roberts, a 31-year-old from the Grangetown area of the Welsh capital whose last known contact with her British family was a postcard sent shortly before she was stabbed to death. Her family and friends can mourn, Rita’s story can start to be told, and police in Belgiumwill look for new leads that may yet lead them to the killer. Speaking at the end of a week when the woman with the flower tattoo made headlines around the world, Interpol’s François-Xavier Laurent, said he was glad that at least one of the 22 families of the Operation Identify Mewomen had some sort of answer. Laurent said: “We did this campaign to provide closure and to give a name back to the victims. More than anything, we want to bring news, even if it’s sad news. I don’t think there’s anything worse than just waiting to get some information. “I’m not trying to put myself in the shoes of missing persons’ families, but I think that at some point knowing what has happened gives more relief than never knowing. Even if it’s 31 years after the moment Rita disappeared, I think the family is at least grateful to know what happened to her and they can start their grieving process and hopefully maybe get some answers in the future about why and how she was murdered.” Operation Identify Me was launched in Mayby the Belgian, Dutch and German police and Interpol, releasing details of the cases that would normally only be available to law enforcement agenciesand giving grabby nicknames that would not be out of place in a thriller: the woman in the well, the body in the bog, the woman in man’s clothing and so on. The body of the woman with the flower tattoo was found in the river near a sports and concert venue on 3 June 1992. She had been in the water for some time – they could only say she was aged 20-50 – and had suffered at least one stab wound. A major clue was the distinctive tattoo on her left forearm – apparently a black rose with green leaves and “R’Nick” written underneath. Police appealed for help at the time but she was not identified and the trail for her killer went cold. In May this year Operation Identify Me was launched, following a Dutch case in which a woman’s body was found in 1999 in an industrial waste container, partly encased in concrete. Within days, the operation had a hit. A relative of Rita Roberts saw the image of the tattoo on a news website and alerted the authorities. They said Roberts had moved from Cardiff to Antwerp in February 1992. She had sent a postcode in May 1992 and not been heard of since. “There are some messages, including Rita’s that straight away give you chills,” said Laurent. “You have a lot of details, a lot of information from the victim’s family that were not made public. You feel everything is clicking. Straight away when we had the information from Rita’s family, we felt something was happening here.” He said the Belgian police should not be blamed for not identifying Roberts sooner. “It’s always easy to think 30 years later, this country should have done that. But there was no internet, DNA work was in its beginnings. The Belgian forensic institute started in 1993, the year after the body was discovered. Countries were not necessarily collaborating in terms of police information. Everything was on paper.” It took six months before the police were happy to go public with Roberts’ identitythis week. Her siblings, who are based in Cardiff and the north-east of England,issued a statement via Durham police, describing Roberts as “a beautiful person” who adored travelling. They added: “Whilst the news has been difficult to process, we are incredibly grateful to have uncovered what happened to Rita.” Friends of Roberts from Cardiff joined in the tributes.“I can’t believe it,” said one. “Rita was a fabulous person … tough but so kind-hearted. I’m so sorry she died that way.” Roberts was born in 1960 and lived near the docks, at that time a challenging neighbourhood. There appears to be no mention of her disappearance in back issues of the South Wales Echo, but there are two reports of court appearances by a woman called Rita Roberts whose age and other details match the missing woman. Two date from the 1980s and one from November 1991, just a few months before she went to Belgium. The Antwerp public prosecutor’s office said she lived in the city for a few months and was never reported missing to the Belgian police. A spokesperson said she had “probably not” been the victim of a sexual assault. Her body remained in Antwerp. The prosecutor’s office said it knew she had a criminal record before it went public with her name. According to a report fromthe University of Portsmouth’s Centre for the Study of Missing Persons, an average of 600 people in the UK go missing abroad each year. “The overwhelming majority are found safe and well,” said Martha Mc Brier, the helplines manager for the charity Missing People. She praised Operation Identify Me’s work. “The not knowing is the worst thing. It never gets better, the feelings remain almost as raw.” Even as they grieve, members of Roberts’ family have paused to remember relatives of the other Identify Me women. One said: “There are 21 other unidentified women who need to be reunited with their families and we very much hope that can be achieved.”",Unknown,,,
491,Guardian,Health Should I worry about my cough?It’s a natural defence against disease that helps clear our airways. But what are the signs that it signifies something more serious?11h ago……,Joel Snape,"Coughing’s reputation, it’s probably fair to say, has taken a bit of a hit. Once an occasional irritation, it recently spent a couple of years as a key symptom of a disease that everyone was worried about, and it has never entirely recovered. Cough on a train in 2021, and a decent chunk of the carriage would look at you as if you should be hermetically sealed in a bag. Do it now, and you may get away with a couple of nasty stares. But, Covid aside, what else might be causing that cough? And is there anything, realistically, you can do about it? “Coughs are a commonly presenting complaint, but in the vast majority of cases they’re nothing to worry about,” says Dr Timothy Gatheral, a consultant respiratory physician at the University of Lancaster. “As a consultant, I have a different perspective, as most cases I see have advanced to something more concerning, but the general NHS advice is not to worry unless you have a cough that persists for more than three weeks, or worsens very abruptly.” It is worth pointing out at this stage that coughing is actually an important part of the body’s defence against disease. It is a natural reaction to getting something stuck in the throat – a sudden-onset cough can often be from an obstruction you didn’t notice on its way down – and it also expels mucus, microbes and foreign particles from the respiratory tract, protecting the lungs. In some cases, excess coughing can actually lead to … more coughing, as the nerve that controls this coughing reflex becomes hypersensitive, which is one reason that it’s helpful to keep short-term coughs in check withhot honey wateror sugar-free sweets. Most short-term coughs are caused by colds or flu, although heartburn, allergies, or infections can all play a part. But again, unless you’ve had one that lasts, it is unlikely to be a signifier of anything serious. Technically, even smoker’s cough can be a temporary issue, caused when the chemicals you inhale from smoking damage the small hairs – known as cilia – lining your airways, as well as causing inflammation and a buildup of mucus. Stop smoking, and it should improve – although other issues caused by lighting up won’t. One of the most common issues signified by a prolonged smoker’s cough, for instance, is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the technical term for a whole group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. “Exposure to cigarette smoke can cause COPD, but so can certain types of dust and chemicals,” says Dr Gatheral. “Asbestos is the one that everyone worries about, but silica dust is increasingly an issue for builders and fitters, as people have their kitchens done.” Smoking-related COPD won’t go away if you give up tobacco – but at least it shouldn’t worsen. Another cause of COPDand other conditions, of course, is pollution: globally responsible for aroundone in six premature deaths worldwide in 2019, it’s worsening in many areas of the UK even as the WHOlowers its recommendationsfor allowable legal limits. If you’re able to choose when you go out, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs keeps afive-day forecast for UK levelsonline; if you can’t avoid the most polluted times, then try to stay away from main roads or at least to the inside of the kerb. Finally, if you have a cough that won’t go away, that worsens abruptly, or that appears alongside other symptoms such as breathing difficulties, unexpected weight loss, or even spots of blood, that’s the time to seek medical help – and be persistent about it. Conditions such as lung cancer or pulmonary fibrosis aren’t easy to treat, but they can be managed. “I don’t want people to worry unnecessarily, but there are times when it’s important to push,” says Dr Gatheral. “Most coughs will resolve on their own, but you know your own body, and if there’s something seriously wrong then it’s crucial that you get it checked out and, if possible, treated, sooner rather than later.” Coughing is mostly good for us, a biological adaptation that stops us from swallowing stuff or expels unpleasant material from our airways. Sometimes, though, it’s a marker of something worse.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 16.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
492,Guardian,‘Like living in a painting’A fairytale farmhouse in Holland,Nell Card,"Reineke left the city behind eight years ago – a move precipitated by a lengthy project in Italy. “I was working on a large retreat in northern Italy,” she explains. “I lived there on and off for a few years and the site was completely immersed in nature. Each time I went, I noticed how calm my surroundings made me feel. When the project was finished, I said to my husband, ‘I want to leave the city, I want us to live in nature.’ This was the first place we saw.” Reineke took her husband, Olaf, to view the property. “I got him at a weak moment,” she recalls with glee. Olaf – who was hungover – was persuaded by Reineke to put in an offer on the spot. When the hangover abated, Olaf started to panic, but Reineke held her nerve. “Although the previous owners had restored many of the building’s original features, they hadn’t been able to keep up with the repairs,” she says. “The house was a bit sad, but I knew we could make her shine.” With three young children and a growing business to run, it marked the promise of a new adventure – albeit in a slightly dishevelled and ancient farmhouse. Reineke studied fine art in Amsterdam and worked as a set designer before segueing into interior design and founding her company, RA Studio, 10 years ago. She decided to approach the creaking farmstead in Abcoude “as if it were a living painting”. They began by replacing the thatched roof and converting the adjoining brick carriage house into their company headquarters (“I’m the creative; Olaf makes everything happen”). The neglected garden took four years to fully restore. By comparison, the house was “actually quite easy”. Low ceilings, sloping roofs and beams lend the house its unique character. “What I really like about this house is that it’s arranged across so many different levels,” says Reineke. “Nothing is symmetrical, there are flights of stairs everywhere, big doors, small doors – it’s very easy to get disoriented. In fact, upstairs, you can go from room to room via several cupboards. It’s perfect for playing hide-and-seek.” Reineke has heightened the fairytale-like quality of the farmhouse with richly layered interiors, unexpected artworks and antiques and a menagerie of animals, including house-trained horses, sheep, dogs, cats, and Diego the pig, who occasionally lets himself in. “It’s very Pippi Longstocking,” she says. At the back of the house is a large living space, once used as a cow barn, with far-reaching views of the countryside. With 7m-high ceilings, the room could easily have felt cavernous and unwelcoming, but Reineke has transformed it into a cosseting space by painting it Farrow & Ball’s Oval Room Blue and adding a contemporary tile stove. Bespoke cabinetry painted in coral and finished with antiqued mirror glass helps divide the room into separate areas while providing additional display space for Reineke’s collection of art. The central dining room is wrapped in raucous, art-deco inspired wallpaper (Babylon by House of Hackney) and furnished with Asian-inspired antiques and artwork. Aside from the terracotta tiled floors, it’s about as far from any farmhouse aesthetic as you can get. “All the furniture and objects I’ve collected throughout my life have moved in with us here,” she explains. “They worked in our industrial apartment in the city, and they work here, too.” In the smaller living room, known as an opkamer, the focal point is a historical painting of a Chinese familyy that Antvelink bought at auction many years ago. “All the colours in this room come from that artwork,” Reineke explains. Traditionally, the opkamer would have been the one room the farmers kept warm. “It’s funny because this is the room we retreat to in winter,” she says. “We light the fire and huddle up on the sofa together, dogs included.” Upstairs, the main bedroom is snuggled up under the eaves, which have been painted marshmallow pink. (“It’s like sleeping in a tent,” says Antvelink.) The adjoining bathroom was completely refurbished. “It’s on the top floor, so we weren’t allowed to add too much weight to the timber structure,” Antvelink explains. “Instead of using marble, I commissioned a painter to create this monochrome, marbled effect. It’s incredible: real craftsmanship. To me, it’s much more romantic – and sustainable – than the real thing.” As a designer, the urge to evolve the interiors is ever present. “I’m always looking to add more,” Reineke confesses. “There’s usually a decorator in the house adding a new colour or a different wallpaper. Nearly 400 years after being built, it remains a constant work in progress.”",Unknown,,,
493,Guardian,‘Did Bezos just ruin cowboy hats for everyone?’Jeff Bezos wore a cowboy hat again. Real cowboys are rolling their eyes Billionaire’s look compared to ‘a sprinkler head’ after he wears getup in a Vogue feature with his fiancee,Alaina Demopoulos," There’s something comforting in the fact that no matter how much money Jeff Bezos makes, or how manyluncheshe attends with Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, the third-wealthiest man in the world continues to have absolutely no drip. Especially when he puts on a cowboy hat. Or at least that was the feeling this week, when the billionaire posed for his fiancee Lauren Sánchez’s Vogue profilewearing his favorite piece of headgear. It was a bit of a throwback to 2021, when he donned a cowboy hat during his first trip to space in a Blue Origin rocket. People hated it back then – the San Francisco Chronicleasked, “Did Jeff Bezos just ruin cowboy hats for everyone?” – and they hate it now. “This looks like a print ad for Viagra cologne,” one X userwrote. Another useraccusedthe billionaire of stealing Kenny Chesney’s stylist. In a new exclusive interview, Lauren Sánchez discusses going to space, giving back, and her high-flying romance with Jeff Bezos. Read the full profile here:https://t.co/q Xtka Xg N1Cpic.twitter.com/rz2CPDCF27 The ultra-rich have long worn western clothing in an attempt to blend in with the working class. The former Mexican president Vicente Foxcalled George W Bush a “windshield cowboy” – someone who can drive a pickup truck but isn’t comfortable on the back of a horse – to dispel 43’s swaggering Texas persona. In 1992, the noted Stetson fan Ronald Reagan gave Mikhail Gorbachev a cowboy hat as a gift … which the Soviet leader put onbackwards. Bezos’s fellow space cowboy Elon Musk recently wore a Stetson at the US-Mexico border and looked so goofy people accused him of having it on the wrong way (he didn’t). Is Bezos’s attempt really that bad? Though he at least wore it frontways, real cowboys say his hat comes across as a costume. Michael Grauer, a curator at the National Cowboy & Western History Museum, lectures about the accessory across the country. “The first question I usually ask the crowd is, ‘What do you call a man in a western hat?’ And the usual answer is, ‘a cowboy’,” Grauer explained. “But I say, ‘No, that’s a man in a western hat.’ It’s a way to co-opt the mystique, to appropriate the symbol of the man on horseback who symbolizes freedom and liberty.” Call it Yellowstone-core, which is abona fide fashion trendin the wake of Paramount’sblockbuster seriesabout a Montana ranching dynasty. And one could argue that Bezos is a rancher — he owns over 150,000 acres in west Texas, where the Vogue profile was shot. That’s not exactly a qualifier, though, according to Grauer. “There are plenty of people who own ranches who don’t know which end of the horse does one thing and what does the other,” he said. “A cowboy hat doesn’t make you someone who espouses the cowboy code. You can wear the clothes, the hat, the boots all day, but unless you embrace what a cowboy really is, frankly, it’s just a costume.” In 1995, Bill Reynolds co-wrote The Cowboy Hat Book, and as part of his research, he spent a day as a hat salesman watching people try the pieces on. “I can tell you that when a person puts on that hat, it changes them,” Reynolds said. “I don’t know who they see in the mirror, whether it’s John Wayne or Kevin Costner, but it changes a person’s perspective on themselves.” But there’s an idealism to the American cowboy, Reynolds said, that is incongruous with Bezos’s image as poster boy for a second Gilded Age. “People always look to the individualism of the cowboy: that his handshake is his bond, and he works an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay,” he said. “The symbol of that hat gives people a lot of peace of mind.” Unless said hat sits upon on a certain executive’s head. It isn’t just the cowboy hat part of the Vogue photoshoot that proves Bezos is no proper ranch hand, Grauer adds. “If he was a cowboy, he wouldn’t be wearing a short-sleeve shirt, because that’s how you get hurt [out in the field],” he said, referencing the plain white tee Sánchez clings to while embracing the billionaire. “It’s subtle, but it’s the small things like that.” Reynolds wonders if the issue is simply one of proportions. In his words, big brim hats can make shorter people “look like a sprinkler head”. (Bezos is 5ft 7in.) Whatever the case, the stink of a PR stunt is all over Bezos’s get-up. “I think somebody probably said to him: this is going to soften your image a tad,” Reynolds said. “I thought it looked a little forced. But at the same time, I think he was having fun with it.”",Sun 19 Nov 2023 14.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
494,Guardian,"Ask Philippa I am so lonely and so isolated, I feel I’m living like a zombie……",Philippa Perry,"The question I found myself listening to an interview with you on the radio the other day. I enjoyed hearing how you approach life and relate to people; it resonated with me. Sadly, my reason for writing is less positive. I’m a 70-year-old guy who, for a long time, has been single and living alone. I took early retirement and volunteered full-time for a charity for several years before walking out in disgust in 2019. I’ve never had that many close friends and in the past five years I have been bizarrely abandoned/rejected by just about all the “friends” I thought I had, including school friends, plus my only brother. Lockdown was hell by myself and I fell into spending most of my time playing solitaire on my laptop, watching TV and listening to the radio. Since lockdown, I’ve continued filling my days in the same way and I almost never socialise with anyone. I’ve been isolated for the past four years, living life like a zombie, and I can’t see how this will change. I’ve tried evening classes, speed dating, etc, in the past and they have made no difference. I’ve never recovered from my grammar school forcing me to give up languages – which I loved and was top in – and do science A-levels. Scraping a third-class degree in chemistry was just the start of living all my life as a lost soul. I feel I’ve wasted my life. I see no way out and fear succumbing to dementia, like my father, followed by a grisly end. Philippa’s answer I felt sad reading your letter and I’m puzzled as to what may be going on for you. You seem to be falling out with everyone, yet you are nice to me and don’t come over as a curmudgeon in your email. You walked out in disgust from the charity you had volunteered at for a few years, and whatever terrible behaviour you witnessed there seems to have contributed to ruptures happening in nearly all your relationships – as though whatever disgusted you at the charity went on to sour your entire life somehow. Did it change the way you approach life and the people in it? I’m guessing it is more likely that whatever happened at the charity triggered feelings from your past that you may never have put into words. It sounds as though you have brooded for a long time about having to give up languages and being made to study science. When you were a child, you did not have full agency over your life – other people made decisions for you. This lack of agency seems to have stuck somehow, so that your relationships and your life are still happening to you as though you don’t know how to make things happen for yourself. You love languages and yet what is not listed in the ways you spend your time is reading in any language. We all need to discover what it is we love and then go and do it. Not to do it for any future self, but to do it because it is enjoyable, interesting, absorbing and makes the best of now. Maybe languages feel like a lost love and to reignite that love may bring up sadness for the lost years. Don’t fear this sadness. It is telling you what you need to do now. It is surprising how hard it can be to indulge ourselves in the things that matter most. Our wishes, our hopes and dreams make us feel vulnerable. We may unconsciously shy away from them because there is a feeling somehow that if we fail at the things that matter most to us, we will then be truly lost. The courage we need to fail is the exact same courage that will help us succeed. And what you need to succeed at right now is to find something that makes your life meaningful today. It sounds so simple to tell you to do the thing you need to for a fulfilling life – work out what you are feeling; from that, figure out what it is that you want; and from there, go for it – but we can bog ourselves down, stopping ourselves with the “what-ifs” that fuel that fear of failure. You mention dementia. Now it is possible there have been some changes in your brain that led to all these fallings-out. I am not a medical doctor, but maybe you could get tested as a way of maybe making sense of what has happened. If that is the story, and I really hope it isn’t, there will be resources for you so that you are not so alone with it, for example,ageuk.org.uk. We don’t have control over all the circumstances of our lives, but what we do have some power over is our relationship with our own self and how we look after our bodies, and over our internal dialogue and how we behave towards others. However difficult relationships are, we all need them and so we need to learn how to cope with the differences we all have from each other.

496,Guardian,"Makeup‘There are three of us in my relationship: my partner, my eyeliner and me’",Unknown,"One of my closest friends while I was growing up in the UK was May, an Egyptian who wore bell-bottoms and scrunchies and who lived in the same building complex as us. I was 12, she was 14; her parents were less strict than mine and so she had started to wear makeup. While hanging out after school one afternoon, she decided to “make me over”. With Ace of Base blasting from her stereo, she carefully drew eyeliner on to my lids and kohl along my waterlines before curling my lashes with mascara. When I looked in the mirror, I was shocked; it was as if I could finally see myself, as if I had somehow come into focus. This was the first of many bonding experiences with the women of my life and with eyeliner: I’d later find myself reapplying it with girlfriends in the darkly lit bathrooms of Beirut’s seedy nightclubs; making panicked phone calls while wiping its smears off my face on the 73 bus, and layering it in solidarity with my sister as we rebelled against our conservative upbringing. Eyeliner was even there when I sat with my imposing grandmother, her hands shaky with age, but still steady enough to stencil her eyes. I knew already as a tween that kohl, the earliest iteration of eyeliner, was far more than just makeup. It connected me not only to my female friends and family, but also to my ancestors, and a whole host of beguiling non-western women in between – among them, Queen Nefertiti herself. And as I would soon realise, this age-old beauty product is a vehicle to access layered traditions spanning centuries. It has touched countless cultures and communities around the globe, in ways that go far beyond the aesthetic. Eyeliner transcends borders and eras. It adorns the eyes of fashionistas in Paris and Bedouin men across the Arabian Peninsula. Members of the Taliban and Afghan Pashtuns line their lids to repel the sun, while Kathakali dancers in India and geisha performers in Japan use eyeliner to draw attention to their glances. Historically, flappers and vikings darkened their eyes with charcoal, flappers to channel a sensual look, vikings to shield vision during battle. Even the prophet Muhammad is believed to have worn a form of eyeliner for medicinal purposes. Traces of the cosmetic can also be found in the Old Testament, which mentions figures with “painted eyes,” including Jezebel. From Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren to Amy Winehouse and Adele, numerous western starlets have become synonymous with distinctive eyeliner styles. A disparate list of characters and contexts, indeed – such is the reach of this versatile object. Eyeliner can signify sultriness or assertiveness based on the thickness of its swoosh. The angle of a wing’s upturn can reveal whether the wearer is a millennial or Gen Z, according to one Tik Toker. Although applications have varied, eyeliner’s aesthetic goal has always been the same: to beautify, enhance or enlarge the eye. The product can transform eyes from exhausted to awake, make younger faces look older and older faces look younger, and take an outfit from work-appropriate to date-appropriate. It can elevate a style from subdued to seductive – all with a few swipes. Commenting on eyeliner’s metamorphic capabilities in I Feel Bad about My Neck, Nora Ephron wrote: “There are a couple of old boyfriends whom I always worry about bumping into, but there’s no chance – if I ever did – that I would recognise either of them. On top of which they live in other cities. But the point is that I still think about them every time I’m tempted to leave the house without eyeliner.” Eyeliner speaks a universallanguage of transformation. Its origins are rooted in Ancient Egypt, where the earliest records of its use date back to at least 3100BCE. Egyptians were obsessed with their looks; they prettified themselves with makeup, luxuriated in perfumes and wore clothes showcasing both status and creativity. This obsession had to do with the importance of rebirth: procreation required conception, which required sex, which required hotness – which required cosmetics. Kohl pots were often buried with the deceased, signifying the pigment’s value.Womenand men applied kohl; the substance was crafted from the minerals malachite and galena. Over and above beautification, kohl was used to treat various eye conditions, protect against the sun’s glare and the desert sands, ward off evil spirits and honour the gods. Some communities in the global south still turn to kohl for the same purposes today, using natural materials to make it. (Science partially validates the ancient belief in kohl’s protective powers: studies have shown that its composition was likely to have provoked an immune response, killing off bacteria.) From the kohl-rimmed gazes of antiquity to Gen Z’s graphic liner looks on Tik Tok, eyeliner has been a reliable go-to for anyone looking to make a statement. In the 1960s, “The louder the [audiences] applauded, the more eyeliner we’d put on the next time,”Ronnie Spectorwrote in her memoir. Soon after,Siouxsie Siouxwould turn a simple line into a subversive act. Prince and David Bowie wore guyliner that inched well beyond the corners of their eyes. Mumbai-based Farah Siddiqui, 41, believes kajal can even point to shifts in beauty ideals. “Bollywood and the media have perpetuated unrealistic beauty standards set by our colonial past and inherent Hindu caste system,” she says. However, in the past decade, South Asian women “have embraced their uniqueness and colour,” with kajal being “an essential part of South Asian heritage”. Meanwhile, in Iran, where women’s appearances are policed, bold eyeliner can be both an aesthetic tool and an act of defiance, underscoring the ties between cosmetics and socio-political dynamics. Eyeliner also whispers deeply personal histories. As a child in the UK, one of my favourite pastimes was watching my Lebanese mother apply kohl. Being an immigrant in Britain while her homeland was in the throes of a civil war – with six children and seemingly the world’s weight on her shoulders – she was surrounded by constant chaos. But her hand never wavered when she lined her eyes; it was as if time had reached a standstill. When she opened her made-up eyes, I marvelled at her charm; I felt I could see our ancestors in her face. My Egyptian grandmother stencilled her eyes with kohl throughout her long life, for the mundane and the monumental, the joyous and the harrowing. She wore it on her wedding day, when she was exiled from her home in Palestine to Lebanon in 1948, and when she was bedridden during her final years. The lines around her eyes lent her a regal look that bordered on intimidating, at least to me. For both my mother and grandmother, eyeliner seemed a tether to their homelands and an assertion of self amid upheaval. When I began to paint my own eyes as a teenager, I also recognised eyeliner’s weight. Later, on dreary London mornings when I longed for home, applying this dark pigment felt like an act of self-love and self-preservation. I contemplated the product’s history, but I also found inspiration in contemporary culture: some days, I mimicked Nefertiti’s wings, on others, Amy Winehouse’s. My eyeliner would start to take on a life of its own as my appreciation for Winehouse’s music grew. Sometimes, my wings flirted with my brows, as if in silent tribute to the singer. “You’re the spit of Amy,” a makeup artist once told me. She wasn’t the first; over time I racked up as many comparisons to her as I did to Nefertiti, and the only common denominator among the three of us is, I suspect, our eye makeup. In the public domain, too, the mark of eyeliner is indelible. It can be found virtually everywhere in the cultural landscape: in theatre, television, cinema and art. It often acts as a symbol of change, alluding to shifts in maturity, elevating drama, or signalling seduction, empowerment or rebellion. In western cinema and TV, intense lines sometimes hint at a person coming undone, or a societal transgression. In The Crown, Diana, Princess of Wales, before being interviewed by the BBC’s Panoramaprogramme about Prince Charles’s infidelity, applies black eyeliner heavily to her lower waterline, giving her eyes a mournful and sombre appearance. Further to its symbolic weight among marginalised communities, there’s a distinct art to eyeliner application. To apply eyeliner is to do a little dance with precision: the slightest quiver of the wrist can mean entire lines must be redrawn. The American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once posted on Instagram about her botched attempt at a wing: “I just want you all to know that no matter who you are or where you’re from, no matter how much you achieve in life, eyeliner will always humble you,” she said. Every morning, I wield my NYX liquid liner with the steady hand of a confident calligrapher. Silence and stillness are required, as is a little prayer to the beauty gods. Should the wing decide to go rogue, I’ll thicken it into submission, occasionally covering half my lid. To complete the look, I apply traditional kohl along my water lines; if you’re going to do a throwback, why not go all the way to Ancient Egypt? Your eyeliner can even be “sharp enough to kill a man,” as Taylor Swift puts it. Perfection isn’t always the aim, though. “I like eyeliner to be fucked up. I like it if it’s a bit destroyed in that it tells a story. It makes it far more engaging and interesting,” says Sharon Dowsett, the former UK makeup director of Maybelline. I take that as a compliment. Of late, especially in theaftermath of the pandemic, the world has reaffirmed its relationship with this iconic cosmetic. At the height of Covid, face masks drove a surge in eyeliner sales. By 2021, the eye-makeup market had increased to $15.6bn and was set to swell to $21.4bn by 2027. This year alone, eyeliner was at the forefront of countless trends. On social media, influencers craft infinite intricate and colourful geometric eyeliner patterns. “The eyeliner might be poppin’, but the mental health is droppin,’” declares one Tik Tok meme. (Not everyone is getting these looks right – according to the more than 15,000 members of the “That’s It, I’m Eyeliner Shaming” Facebook group. The community offers a space for “eyeliner elitists to complain about everyone else.”) While eyeliner’s popularity has grown, the depths of its origins have been lost on many, with proponents of Eurocentric beauty norms overshadowing or selectively borrowing from diverse beauty practices. In that context, to Manchester-based influencer Fatima Camara, eyeliner becomes almost political. Camara, 26, views eyeliner as a “gift,” allowing her to craft any shape or colour combination she desires; her posts have featured hearts, tiger prints, jewels and butterfly wings. In one post, she decorates her eyes with the colours of the Senegalese flag to mark its Independence Day. “Have you ever seen a Black fairy?” she asks in another, in which her lines are adorned with flowers. The makeup artist acknowledges that how people respond to women wearing makeup, including eyeliner, often depends on their race or ethnicity. While eyeliner might be perceived as exotic to some, for Camara, it’s a symbolic link to her African roots. “When I wear my eyeliner, I feel like I am connecting with my African queen,” Camara says of Nefertiti. “Channelling that representation is everything.” Eyeliner is an accessory to a larger story about how we communicate our identities and desires; it’s the story of human ingenuity, resourcefulness, aspiration, and imagination rolled into one. To open our eyes to the fascinating path eyeliner has drawn through space and time is to embark on a journey freighted with meaning, if not outright magic. Eyeliner bears the weight of centuries of history, empires, queens and kings, poets and writers, tribes people and nomads. Imagine carrying all that in your purse. Eyeliner’s aesthetic benefits are unmatched (I’d presume Nefertiti felt the same). I’m more committed to my eyeliner than I am to any inanimate object, to the extent that if I’m not wearing it, my mother asks me if I’m ill. When I’m out the door, it’s phone, keys, cards, eyeliner. I sport pigment around my eyes to Pilates, to the shops, and when I’m alone at home. There are three of us in my current relationship – me, my partner, and my eyeliner. Exasperated that he rarely sees me with unadorned eyes, my boyfriend recently remarked that, while empowering and protective, armour can also weigh us down. Sometimes, he said, it helps to remove it, to show the world who we really are. He has a point. But this, I responded, is where I draw the literal line: I wear eyeliner not because I’m masking something, but because it decorates me with the beauty that is my cultural heritage. My eyeliner is as much a part of me as my culture is. And just as I’m never without my sister, mother or grandmothers, I am never without my kohl.

497,Guardian,‘Crusade for haute couture’252-item Chanel collection up for auction in Paris,Ellie Violet Bramley,"Fashion history of the hautest order is going up for auction in Paris on Monday – 252 items of Chanel couture by the late designer Karl Lagerfeld. All of them have come from the wardrobe of the real estate entrepreneur Mouna Ayoub, a French socialite of Lebanese origin who is said to own the world’s largest collection of couture – more than 2,700 items. Pieces up for auction include a“ribbon” dress with sequinsfrom the spring/summer 1991 collection that took 150 hours to make plus another 250 hours to embroider, and asilk crepe dress with chainsfrom the following year that is identical to one worn by Penélope Cruz in the Pedro Almodóvar film Broken Embraces. Both are expected to go for between €12,000 and €15,000 but it was the latter, Ayoub said, that was the garment that it was most difficult to part with. Anevening coat, embroidered over the course of 800 hours to be reminiscent of Coromandel lacquered screens, is the item Ayoub has the fondest memories of wearing. “I wore it at a venue when Karl [Lagerfeld] was present,” she said. She styled it open “over a turtleneck and a pair of pants. When Karl saw me he was so shocked and asked me how could I do that. I told him that I gained weight and can’t close it. He then laughed and said to me, ‘join the club’.” It is estimated it will fetch between €150,000 and €200,000. A devotee of the craftsmanship of couture, Ayoubreportedlyused to keep her clothes in a glass-walled wardrobe in her office in Riyadh so she could admire them while at work. As sherecently told Vogue: “When I came into the scene, which was in the 80s, there was a lot of talk that haute couture was dying, so I kind of panicked.” She started her “own crusade for haute couture”. The Chaneldesigns date from the early 1990s to 2014, and several were first modelled by the original supermodels, including Linda Evangelista, Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington. Many pieces – perhaps most – have never been worn. Ayoub, now 66, was formerly married to the Saudi business executive Nasser Rashid and, as she recently told Vogue: “I wasn’t allowed to wear short dresses, or dresses with no sleeves and things like that – they’re still brand new and it’s about time for somebody else to enjoy and wear them.” Ayoub is reportedly selling these items because they no longer fit and she wants to make room for new purchases. She also plans to give some of the proceeds to Fondation des Femmes, a French charity for women affected by violence and abuse. The sale isorganised by Maurice Auction in Parisand the British fashion auctioneer Kerry Taylor.",Sun 19 Nov 2023 10.00 CET,19.0,11.0,2023.0
498,Guardian,"Nigel Slater recipes Grilled lamb and mashed aubergine, and for cauliflower, lemon and capers",Nigel Slater,"On most occasions I forgo the grilling and bake my aubergines instead. A compromise, but one that works. I set the oven to high and ensure the skins are blackened before splitting and scooping out the silky flesh with a spoon. A deeply pleasing task. I then mash it with a fork, slowly introducing olive oil and lemon juice. Its uses are endless, though I tend to get through quite a bit with warm flatbread alone. This week we ate it with grilled lamb cutlets, letting the juices from the meat sink on to the aubergine cream, then adding a contrast of textures with a handful of crisp, lemon-spiked breadcrumbs. On another note, there are some cracking cauliflowers about. I browned some plump florets in a pan this week, tossing them with lemon, spring onions and capers. We ate them both as a principal dish and again, the next day, as a salad. If the pieces had been smaller, it would have worked in a bun, too, the olive and caper dressing soaking through the bun’s soft, open crumb. You can grill or bake the aubergines or cook them over an open flame. The latter will take an age and makes much smoke, so do it in a well-ventilated room. Serves 3-4 For the aubergines:aubergines3, largegarlic4 plump cloveslemonthe juice of 1olive oil100ml Aleppo pepper½-1 tsp For the gremolataolive oil3 tbspwhite breadcrumbs80gparsley20glemongrated zest of 1lamb cutlets6-8olive oila littleza’atara little If you are grilling the aubergines, place them on the bars of a hot griddle pan over a moderately high heat, then turn them as each side becomes charred. Expect smoke. Alternatively, you can bake them. If you are baking the aubergines, preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Put the aubergines in a roasting tin, leaving a little space between them. Put the whole, unpeeled garlic cloves among the aubergines, then bake for 50 minutes to an hour until the aubergines are soft and will collapse under gentle pressure. The garlic cloves should have darkened outside and be soft and silky within. Slice the aubergines in half and scrape the flesh into a mixing bowl. Pop the flesh from the garlic skins into the aubergine. Beat lightly with a whisk to mash all the flesh to a coarse purée, then stir in the lemon juice. Beat in the olive oil until you have a soft, coarse texture, seasoning with salt and black pepper as you go. Set aside. To make the gremolata, pour the oil into a frying pan over a moderate heat, then add the breadcrumbs. Let them cook, soaking up the oil, until crisp and golden. While the crumbs are cooking, roughly chop the parsley, then, once the crumbs are crisp, stir in the parsley and lemon zest. Brush the lamb cutlets with oil, sprinkle lightly with za’atar, then cook on or under a hot grill, or on the griddle until the outside is dark and the inside is rose pink, turning once. Spoon the aubergine mash on to a serving dish, scatter over a pinch or two of the Aleppo pepper. Place the cooked cutlets on top, then scatter with gremolata. I like to steam cauliflower briefly before I grill, roast or sauté it. The florets stay deliciously moist inside while the outside browns.Serves 2-3 cauliflower1, medium-sizedgarlic2 clovesolive oila littlelemon1Aleppo pepper1 tspspring onions3parsleya small bunchcapers1½ tbsp Bring a medium-sized pan of water to the boil and place a steamer basket or colander over top. Trim the cauliflower, break into large florets, then slice each in half. Drop them into the steamer basket and cover with a lid. Let the cauliflower steam for 5-6 minutes until just tender to the point of a knife, then remove the steamer basket. Flatten the garlic cloves with the side of a knife, but don’t peel them. Heat a good glug of oil in a shallow pan set over a medium heat. Place the flattened garlic cloves in the oil, together with the cauliflower pieces, cut-side down in the oil, partially cover with a lid and leave until lightly browned. About 7 or 8 minutes. Make the dressing: finely grate the zest from the lemon and squeeze the juice. Add the capers and the Aleppo pepper. Finely chop the spring onions, discarding the very dark green tips, then stir into the dressing. Roughly chop the parsley and stir in together with capers. As the cauliflower lightly browns, pour the dressing over and toss the florets in it. Transfer to a serving dish. Follow Nigel on Instagram@Nigel Slater",Unknown,,,

500,Guardian,40 outrageous photos that changed fashion From teenage Kate Moss to Twiggy in a mini and Lady Gaga’s meat dress,Jess Cartner-Morley,"Picture Twiggy, mid-60s, in a minidress. Her legs spring-loaded with coltish youth, she’s wide-eyed and spidery-lashed. Now picture the classic Dior “new look”: an hourglass jacket whittled to willowy form. A woman stands serene as a ballerina, one pointed toe directed at the camera. Both are fashion photographs selling the world a new silhouette. But both are about so much more than the clothes. A great fashion photograph is not just about a great outfit. It captures a moment in history. It is more than a portrait of a person; it is a portrait of all of us at that moment. Jumping into the frame like a kid who’s been hiding behind a door, Twiggy is rattling the cage of the establishment with the charm to get away with it. Katharine Hamnett at Downing Street,wearing her “58% DON’T WANT PERSHING”T-shirt – against the proliferation of US nuclear missiles in Europe – is made all the more delicious by the detail that Margaret Thatcher wears a polka-dot pussy-bow blouse, a perfectly matched duel of 80s power dressing. Other times, clothes barely figure. In herfirst shoot for the Facein July 1990, Kate Moss turned the tables on the ostentatious wealth of the 80s in an instant. She heralded a changing of the guard, and the dawn of the age of grunge. Polly Devlin, writing in the Vogue Book of Fashion Photography, notes that it is “a unique, valuable and extraordinarily detailed view of women … we see very clearly how women looked; not just how they dressed, but how they desired to look, and were expected to look, and how they were looked at”. The role of women in the workplace, the sexual freedoms won, the political battles fought: all this is played out in front of the camera. But fashion photography as a picture-book history of women is told mostly from the eye of the beholder. Many images are now shocking for the red flags of abuse the world was oblivious to at that time.Speaking on Desert Island Discslast year, Moss revealed she “cried a lot” on early shoots because she hated removing her clothes, taking Valium to ease her nerves when she had to be topless on set. The female gaze has begun to shift this power dynamic. Having more women behind the lens in the 21st century has helped make the sexualised tropes of men photographing beautiful women – high-heeled legs, eyes half-closed as if in submissive ecstasy – look dated and tired. More empathy behind the lens has revolutionised the way we think and talk about models. Our definition of beauty has expanded exponentially from the days when it was defined by overwhelmingly white, size six supermodels. Sophie Dahl’s voluptuous figure was a wake-up call to the industry, while Donyale Luna, known as the first Black supermodel, broke boundaries when she graced the cover of British Voguein 1966. Meanwhile, social media, which transformed the fashion landscape years before it permeated the rest of culture, transformed style’s chain of command. The best fashion images can stop you in your tracks, a sucker punch of delight, like hearing a great pop song for the first time. But great fashion photography is the exception to the rule. The majority of fashion images are too airless and worshipful to feel alive, too nakedly transactional to make the heart sing. Yet the fact that fashion photographs often have skin in the game of commerce, selling magazines or jeans or perfume, is part of what makes them compelling. Good business is the best art, Andy Warhol said. The story of how our identity as consumers has cannibalised our identity as citizens is a tale of our times, storyboarded with searing clarity on fashion billboards. Guy Bourdin’s unsettling photographs, with women sliced into body parts in the service of selling high-heeled shoes, are both complicit in the weirdness of the world and commenting on it. (See also the meta-commentary of Juergen Teller’s image of Victoria Beckham’s legsspilling out of a shopping bag.) The most memorable fashion photographs have a kind of magic. In 1966, new Parisian fashion sensation Yves Saint Laurentincluded a woman’s tuxedo trouser suit with a satin side stripe in his couture collection. He called it “Le Smoking”. It was the first time a couturier had presented trousers as women’s eveningwear, and it caused a sensation. Women were turned away from restaurants while wearing it. (When socialite Nan Kempner was refused entry to La Côte Basque in Manhattan, she removed her trousers and wore the blazer as a minidress.) But it was a Helmut Newton photograph, Rue Aubriot, taken nine years later for French Vogue, that became the ultimate iconic image of Le Smoking. The narrow street has a grainy, before-midnight light. The image plays on our expectations of gender in ways that riff on the trouser suit: the model angles her cigarette as if to hide it; the jut of her elbow adds breadth to her shoulders. She doesn’t smile or meet our eye; you can almost see the muscle twitching as she sets her jaw. There are worlds within this image. What’s more, the photographs here have changed how you and I get dressed. Sometimes this is a new silhouette or proportion, as with the new look or Miu Miu’smicro miniskirt. Sometimes it is a rewriting of etiquette: when Tom Ford unfastened a few extra buttons on a Gucci silk shirt on the Milan catwalk, he may well have unbuttoned yours, too. Sometimes it is a mirror held up to the changes in the world around us. Marc Jacobs’s “grunge” collection stuck a safety pin in a bubble of glamour that hung over fashion from the previous decade. If you ever tied your flannel shirt around your waist or pulled your cardigan sleeves over your knuckles – and didn’t already love Nirvana– well, this is why. Sometimes, fashion photographs seem to show us a truth they couldn’t possibly have grasped at the time. The spectacle of Shalom Harlow beingspray-painted in a white dresson the Alexander Mc Queen catwalk is even more unsettling to watch now, in the year of AI, than it was then, capturing a sense of power and agency shifting from humans to robots before our eyes. That Mc Queen show took place in 1998. Fashion often looks like nothing more than fantasy. But – as these photos show – it might just speak the truth.JCM By Willy Maywald, 1947 Days after Christian Diorshowed his 1947 New Look collection in Paris, with its voluminous skirts, beading and silk, salesgirls tore apart his dresses and protesters took to the streets with signs that read, “Burn Dior!” Having embraced the wartime mantra of “make do and mend”, many women were shocked by the collection’s embrace of excess. Others were angered by the cinched waists and longer length skirts, having enjoyed greater freedom in their utilitarian uniforms. Fearing the collection would lead to demand for more fabric, the Board of Trade banned British Vogue from mentioning Dior in its pages. Describing the look as “the quintessence of femininity”, the curator and fashion historian Pamela Golbin says, “Fashion has always been a mirror of societal needs and desires. In the postwar period, the New Look put an end to functional clothing and signalled the beginning of the golden age of couture.” By Popperfoto, 1966 Mary Quant’s above-the-knee hemlines defined the fashion of London’s swinging 60s, and the British model Twiggy captured the new attitude. Gone were long, heavy skirts and uncomfortable girdles. In their place arrived miniskirts with pockets, worn with tights, not stockings. In her 1966 autobiography, Quant, who died in April, described fashion as “a tool to compete in life outside the home”. By Fergus Greer, 1989 The late Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery had a profound influence on many designers. Provocative, and at times perversive (he once sprayed enema fluid over unsuspecting audience members), Bowery embraced the theatrical, strutting around London’s Soho in towering heels, gimp masks and clothing with cartoon-like proportions. In 2016, designer Rick Owens channelled Bowery’s “Birthing Performance” by strapping gymnasts to model’s bodies, while Martin Margiela paid homage to his bulbous tulle headdress in 2009. By Guy Bourdin, 1979 The 20th-century French artist Guy Bourdin pushed the boundaries of fashion photography, using images to challenge the viewer to imagine a story, rather than just focusing on a product. The surrealist influence in his pictures is often credited to his early work with the American visual artist Man Ray. During the 60s and 70s he turned ordinary locations such as an alleyway, a bedroom and a car into melodramatic, often sinister sets, exploring themes of sexual violence and sadomasochism. This photograph was taken for a spring campaign for the French label Charles Jourdan. By Corinne Day, 1993 A series of images taken by Corinne Day of the teenage Kate Mosshelped define the 90s, capturing a hedonistic early stage of Cool Britannia. Day’s grungy aesthetic and Moss’s body shape sparked debates around “heroin chic”. Moss later admitted Day could be “tricky” to work with: “She would say, ‘If you don’t take your top off, I’m not going to book you for Elle.’ It is painful. I loved her, she was my best friend, but she was a tricky person. The pictures are amazing, so she got what she wanted and I suffered for them, but they did me a world of good really. They changed my career.” By Bettmann Archive, 1962 On 19 May 1962,Marilyn Monroetottered across the stage at New York’s Madison Square Garden to sing Happy Birthday to President John F Kennedy. The audience gasped as she slowly shrugged off a white fur coat to reveal a skin-tight slinky dress, sketched by young designer Bob Mackie, in the same colour as her skin tone and covered in more than 2,500 crystals. Fast forward to May 2022 and the dress made headlines again when Kim Kardashian wore it to the Met Gala. Mackie described the loan as “a big mistake”, saying Monroe’s dress “was designed for her, and no one else should be seen in that dress”. By Richard Chambury, 1997 After magazine editor Isabella Blow spotted her crying on the street, Sophie Dahl soon became one of the world’s most famous plus size models. At a time when “heroin chic” ruled the runway, the press tormented the granddaughter of Roald Dahl about her curvier body. “At first I found it baffling,” Dahl told an interviewer in 2008. “At 18 you do not set out with any great agenda … In retrospect I see why the whole thing happened.” By Ugg, 2021 Once seen as “ugly footwear”, today you’re more likely to spot Ugg boots on the front row at fashion week than you are a pair of killer high heels. Nothing better encapsulated the shift to sensible shoes than when, in 2021, the late André Leon Talley – a revered editor at US Vogue who died in 2022 – fronted a campaign for Ugg. Declaring them “comfort food for my feet”, Leon Talley said he had collected “dozens” of pairs. By Matt Winkelmeyer, 2019 For the 2019 Met Gala, themed around Susan Sontag’s essay Notes on “Camp”, actor Billy Porter nodded to Cleopatra and ancient Egypt. He was carried up the steps of New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art by six shirtless men, wearing a crystalised jumpsuit featuring 10ft wings and a 24-carat gold headpiece. It was, said David Blond, co-founder of designers The Blonds, “like wearing a weighted blanket”. His team worked for over three months to create the complete look. Porter, whose red carpet style regularly confronts gender norms, told Vogue, “Camp is often used as a pejorative. When it’s done properly, it’s one of the highest forms of fashion and art.” By Jamie Morgan, 1986 More than 30 years after his death, designer Ray Petri’s influence continues to pervade fashion. Men in skirts, and sports gear as luxury fashion pieces, were all looks championed in the 80s by Petri, who was joined by a small group of close confidants in London working under the moniker “Buffalo”. The group soon shaped the decade’s approach to menswear. Their name alludes to Bob Marley’s Buffalo Soldier, and Neneh Cherry made the sobriquet mainstream with her 1988 hit Buffalo Stance. The photographer Jamie Morgan captured much of Petri’s daring aesthetic. Forerunners such as The Face championed them, but Petri died before the true impact of his work became apparent. By Matt Sayles, 2010 Created by the artist and designer Franc Fernandez, Lady Gaga’s viral “Meat Dress”, worn at the 2010 MTV VMAs, featured 50lb of rib and steak, purchased from Fernandez’s local butcher, sewn on to a corset and turned into a fascinator. It acted as a precursor to Gaga’s “The Prime Rib of America” speech, where she lobbied against the US military’s Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy for LGBTQ+ personnel, and it ushered in a new era of stunt dressing for the viral age. By Steven Meisel, 2005 As one of the fashion industry’s pre-eminent photographers, Steven Meisel’s career spans countless shoots for Vogue and campaigns for Calvin Klein, Versace and Prada. The American’s style is diverse: at times it’s unpretentious in black and white; at other times, complex and colourful. A prolific worker, Meisel has pushed the boundaries of fashion imagery, regularly using it as a tool for social commentary, such as this image from a shoot for Vogue Italia, “Makeover Madness”, which looked at how cosmetic surgery had become as intrinsic to modern body image as fashion itself. By David Bailey, 1966 In March 1966, Donyale Luna became the first Black model to appear on the cover of British Vogue. Shot by David Bailey and inspired by Picasso’s disjointed portraits, Luna holds the gaze of the viewer through one eye, peeking through fingers forming a V for Vogue. Luna’s appearance on the mainstream magazine was of huge cultural significance. She paved the way for other Black models, including Beverly Johnson who in 1974 became the first Black cover star for US Vogue. By Erwin Blumenfeld, 1950 Dubbed a visual haiku, the American photographer’s sparse cover for Vogue broke the fashion mould. The model Jean Patchett was reduced to four features: arched brow, heavily lined left eye, crimson lips and mole. It turned her into the face of a decade, as consumers experimented with the “doe eye” look, later emulated by Edie Sedgwick in the 60s. By Frédérique Dumoulin, 2018 In March 2018, the late Virgil Abloh made history when he was appointed artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear, becoming the first Black person to hold the position. Hailed as a fashion maverick (he was also a DJ, furniture designer and artist), he redefined luxury, marrying it with the worlds of hip-hop and hype culture. His debut collection for the luxury French house was inspired by the 1939 musical film The Wizard of Oz. Fashion students sat on the front row while models from every continent in the world (bar Antarctica) walked down a gradient rainbow runway – referencing Abloh’s own extraordinary journey along the Yellow Brick Road. By Louise Dahl-Wolfe, 1953 When Harper’s Bazaar editor Carmel Snow wanted to portray a more modern, liberated woman, she turned to Louise Dahl-Wolfe. Shunning the studio and heading outdoors to capture both models and clothes in motion, her work broke ground, and helped forge the way for other female photographers. “She was the bar we all measured ourselves against,” Richard Avedon later said. Pictured here is American model Jean Patchett in Granada. By Juergen Teller, 2008 Back in 2008, Victoria Beckham was known best for her permatan and ability to never smile in photographs. So it surprised everyone when she agreed to appear in a tongue-in-cheek ad campaign for Marc Jacobs. Shot by the provocative German photographer Juergen Teller, Beckham was captured with her bare legs and high-heeled feet (tan marks and all) flopping over the side of an embossed shopping bag. Recalling the shoot, Teller said, “I told her, ‘You’re the most photographed woman in the world. And fashion nowadays is all about product … bags and shoes … and you’re kind of a product yourself, aren’t you?’ She was, like, ‘Uh, yeah.’” A decade later, Beckham, now herself a respected designer, recreated the image with Jacobs’s blessing for the 10th anniversary of her own fashion line. By Norman Parkinson, 1975 When a team from British Vogue – including photographer Norman Parkinson, stylist Grace Coddington and model Jerry Hall– were asked to shoot in the Soviet Union, they became the first fashion magazine to receive such an invitation. Appointed a tourist guide, they travelled around with Parkinson pushing Hall, then 18, to the extreme. She climbed up oil rigs, stood on a specially commissioned plinth in the Red Sea and fell off a horse riding bareback. By Richard Avedon, 1969 Andy Warhol’s studio space, dubbed The Factory, attracted an avant garde coterie of artists, film-makers and aspiring superstars. In 1969, Avedon, the celebrated fashion photographer who contributed to Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, capturing everyone from pop stars to political activists, turned his attention to Warhol. He invited the artist and his inner circle to be photographed at his own studio. The resulting images – featuring the film director Paul Morrissey, the poet Gerard Malanga and the actor and “Warhol superstar” Candy Darling, with penis (which she referred to as her “flaw”) on display – were regarded as highly transgressive at the time. By Helmut Newton, 1975 In 1966, Yves Saint Laurent unveiled “Le Smoking”, the first time any designer had suggested women’s suits for eveningwear. Inspired by the silk-lapelled jackets men wore to protect their clothing from cigar ash, YSL’s womenswear version came with a gently tapered waist and sleeker collar. “I was deeply struck by a photograph of Marlene Dietrich wearing men’s clothes,” the designer said. “A tuxedo, a blazer or a naval officer’s uniform – a woman dressed as a man must be at the height of femininity to fight against a costume that isn’t hers.” It was initially snubbed by his couture clients who deemed it too radical. But months later he included a similar piece in his more affordable ready-to-wear line, Rive Gauche, and it became an instant hit. By Vittorio Zunino Celotto, 2019 Without Jennifer Lopez’s jungle-printed Versace dress, the internet would have been a very different place. After the singer and actor wore it on the 2000 Grammy awards red carpet, the tech team at Google noticed it was the most popular search query ever. At the time, search results were just a list of blue links. Weeks later Google Image Search was born. At a 2019 Versace show, J-Lo broke the internet again when she wore a take on the original dress. By David Bailey, 1962 Clutching an old teddy bear and posing against the gritty streetscapes of New York City, Jean Shrimpton’s 1962 shoot with David Bailey for Vogue broke all the rules and, in doing so, established the duo as central figures of the 60s cultural revolution. Until then, magazine shoots usually took place in a studio, with aristocratic models in classic poses. Shrimpton, a “home counties girl”, and Bailey, from London’s East End, rebelled by shunning hair and makeup, and embracing a raw street reportage aesthetic. By PA, 1984 In 1984, British designer Katharine Hamnettmade headlines by shaking hands with the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher wearing a T-shirt that referenced the stationing of US nuclear missiles across western Europe. Hamnett said Thatcher “let out a squawk, like a chicken” when she bent down and read it. Now 76, Hamnett continues to produce slogan tees, including most recently “Cancel Brexit” and “Don’t Shoot”. By Nick Knight, 1997 Years before Instagram filters and AI had entered the cultural lexicon, photographer Nick Knight was exploring digital deception. This shoot with Devon Aoki pushed the boundaries of conventional fashion photography and still sparks conversation today. Wearing a floral Alexander Mc Queendress, Aoki appears as half-human, half-monster, her left eye glowing blue, her forehead spliced open, revealing pink cherry blossom blood. By Fendi, 2007 When Fendi transformed a section of the Great Wall of China into a sloping runway, 500 guests sat on heated benches, sipping hot chocolate as 88 models – eight being a lucky number in China – showcased its spring/summer 2008 collection. By doing so, Fendi signalled they were serious about catering to the rapidly growing appetite for luxury in east Asia. Since then, the market continues to expand, with international buyers flocking to Seoul fashion week while brands vie over K-pop stars to front campaigns. By Ullstein Bild, 1937 Designed to both shock and amuse, 20th-century Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli’s collaborations with Salvador Dalí continue to be referenced by designers today. The shoe hat, made in 1937-38, evolved from a photograph Dali’s wife Gala had taken of him wearing one of her slippers on his head. By Ken Towner, 1998 Alexander Mc Queen’s “No.13” show took place at an unused bus depot in London’s Victoria. Celebrities were shunned; Mc Queen reportedly didn’t want them to detract from the clothes. Instead the installation team were invited to bring along friends as thanks for putting up the stadium seating for free. The finale, inspired by artist Rebecca Horn’s installation of two shotguns firing blood-red paint at each other, saw model Shalom Harlow stand on a revolving wooden turntable as two mechanical robots began to spray paint at her. “And when they were finished,” Harlow later recalled, “they sort of receded and I almost staggered up to the audience and splayed myself in front of them with complete abandon.” By Masayoshi Sukita, 1973 David Bowie was the master of reinvention. Some of his most memorable looks – including this famous Ziggy-era jumpsuit – were thanks to a longstanding partnership with the designer Kansai Yamamoto, whose avant garde designs often incorporated elements from Japanese culture. Bowie wore pieces from both Yamamoto’s menswear and womenswear collections, later becoming a reference for modern gender-defying fashion. Speaking about Bowie in 2016, Yamamoto said, “Some sort of chemical reaction took place. My clothes became part of David, his songs and his music. They became part of the message he delivered to the world.” By David Dagley, 1976 Vivienne Westwood (on right) and then partner Malcolm Mc Laren’s shop Sex – later renamed Worlds End – on London’s Kings Road featured phallic graffiti and feminist tracts on the walls, and sold whips and chains as well as rubber skirts and T-shirts with pornographic text. Sales assistants included Chrissie Hynde (centre) and the Sex Pistols’ Glen Matlock (fellow Pistol Steve Jones is on the left), while sex workers and Sloane Rangers shopped side by side. Speaking about the portrait, Sex employee Pamela Rooke, AKA Jordan, said, “I’m not sure why I lifted my top, but it felt right, and still does. There’s nothing sexual about it. It’s empowering: a young woman who is comfortable in her own skin. After, I went back to serving customers. It was all fairly matter-of-fact.” The shop was integral to the punk scene, inspiring the aesthetics of Adam Ant and Siouxsie Sioux, and served as a meeting point for Sid Vicious, Hynde and John Lydon. By Ricky Powell, 1987 “What was revolutionary about Run-DMC’s style was that they were not dressing up. They were wearing what kids wore on the street, things like Kangol hats, Adidas sneakers and tracksuits,” says Shad Kabango, rapper and presenter of the Netflix documentary series Hip-Hop Evolution. “They gave hip-hop its own style. Their early records were so different from even the disco-oriented rap of Kurtis Blow or Sugarhill Gang. It was more raw and street. It made sense for their clothing to match that.” Their 1986 single My Adidas was recorded without the brand’s consent and revolutionised the relationship between fashion and music. The turning point came when an Adidas employee told his bosses he had witnessed tens of thousands of fans lifting their Adidas sneakers into the air at a gig. Weeks later Run-DMC became the first hip-hop group to receive a million-dollar endorsement deal. By Estrop, 2021 Miu Miu declared the end of pandemic sweatpants when it sent a micro mini down its 2022 spring/summer runwayr. Both low rise and bottom skimming, it featured a raw-edged hem and exposed pockets, giving the impression of a teenager who had hacked their school skirt with kitchen scissors. The world went mad for it. The shopping site Lyst was getting 900 searches a day, while Tik Tok was peppered with videos on how to create your own. When the then 54-year-old actor Nicole Kidman wore iton the cover of Vanity Fair, a fight over age-appropriate dressing erupted online, with Kidman later defending the styling, saying she “begged” to wear the outfit. Meanwhile when plus-sized model Paloma Elsesser wore it on the cover of i-D, there was fury that a skirt had to be custom made to fit her. By Kevin Mazur, 2001 Jeans and a nice top? Destiny’s Child defined the style of the late 90s and early 00s, popularising key aspects of Y2K style – low-rise jeans, sparkly chain belts, bustier tops – that Tik Tokers would emulate two decades later. Tina Knowles-Lawson, Beyoncé’s mother, served as their stylist, later revealing that many designers wouldn’t dress the trio so shemade pieces herself. Speaking to W magazine in 2020, Knowles-Lawson said that she was advised by the group’s label to tone down their outfits. “I took offence to it because I felt like the girls, in their splendour, were different, they were unique, they were unapologetically Black.” By Guy Marineau, 1995 American designer Ford joined Gucci in 1990 and is widely credited with saving the Italian brand from bankruptcy, transforming it into a coveted symbol of sex and glamour. His 1995 collection featuring velvet suiting and satin shirts, modelled by Kate Moss and Amber Valletta, was an instant hit – revenues doubled over the next nine months, Ford was hailed as a major talent and Madonnawould chant “Gucci, Gucci, Gucci” when dressed in the collection at the MTV VMAs. Ford was contractually forbidden to take a bow, but ignored the clause, telling Dazed, “The next day you could not get into the showroom. It was absolute hysteria. So, no, no one gave me flak after that.” By Albert Watson, 2006 Steve Jobs took a simple approach to dressing: the Apple co-founder was said to have owned more than 100 black roll-neck jumpers, made for him by his friend Issey Miyake. Levi’s 501 jeans worn with New Balance trainers or Birkenstocks formed the rest of his uniform. From the mid-90s to his death in 2011, it was rare to find him pictured in anything else. Supposedly pegged to the idea of “decision fatigue” – ie, the time taken to choose what to wear would use up valuable brain space – tech billionaires regularly try to replicate Jobs’s automated approach to dressing. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg switches between a grey T-shirt or grey hoodie with jeans, while disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes copied Jobs’s look with a daily black roll-neck. By Johnny Eggitt, 1995, and Greg Harris, 2019 As one of the world’s most photographed women,Diana, Princess of Wales, knew that the way she chose to present herself through her clothing was key. From shunning gloves to shake hands with people diagnosed with HIV/Aids to the “revenge dress” she wore the night Charles confessed to having an affair with Camilla, you can trace many key moments of her life through her wardrobe. However, it’s an oversized “Fly Virgin Atlantic” sweatshirt and cycling shorts that, nearly 30 years later, everyone from influencers to high street brands continues to revere. The sweatshirt, originally a gift from the airline’s founder, Richard Branson, sold to an anonymous buyer for over £43,000 in 2019. That same year, in a shoot for Vogue Paris, gen Z’s favourite model, Hailey Bieber, recreated the athleisure look. By Peter Lindbergh, 1988 When Anna Wintour arrived as editor-in-chief of US Vogue in 1988, she found a shot taken by German photographer Peter Lindbergh shoved in a drawer. Featuring six relatively unknown models (from left: Estelle Lefébure, Karen Alexander, Rachel Williams, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Christy Turlington) wearing white shirts on a Santa Monica beach, it had been rejected by her predecessor who preferred traditional glamour. Wintour later ran the shot, and in doing so elevated the humble white shirt to a wardrobe must-have. Four years later, for Vogue’s 100th anniversary, she endorsed it again, when she featured 10 supermodels in shirts tied at the midriff, this time from Gap, making a high-fashion look attainable to the masses. By Jean-Baptiste Mondino,1990 Madonna’s conical bra, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, popularised the idea of wearing underwear as outerwear. First worn on her 1990 Blonde Ambition tour, the garment was paired with a pinstriped suit and monocle. Instead of the traditional soft curves a corset created, Gaultier’s version made the body hard and explicit. Combined with the singer’s gyrating dancing, BDSM imagery and religious iconography, the outfit made headlines worldwide. By Paul van Riel, 1984 French designer Thierry Mugler could be credited with creating the archetype of the viral runway show. In 1984, he filled the Zénith arena in Paris with more than 6,000 fans who saw model Pat Cleveland, six months pregnant and dressed as the Virgin Mary, descend from the roof. As the New York Times said, “The day may never return when fashion shows were simple affairs in which models carried numbered cards down the runways to the sound of buyers and journalists quietly breathing.” By Herb Ritts, 1990 This now famous shot of Naomi Campbell– wearing only a pair of patent leather thigh-high boots and a matching hair wrap – was part of a series by American photographer Herb Ritts that was originally rejected by American Vogue. Ritts became known for his use of natural lighting, regularly shooting on the rooftop of his studio in LA. Drawing on his love of architecture and sculpture, he worked closely with his subjects using props to execute his visual motifs. “The poses could be very hard,” Campbell said. “You’d be in a lot of pain and the sun would be beating down, but Herb would say, ‘Just give me a little more time – I’m going to get it.’” By Kyle Ericksen, 1992 Taking inspiration from the grunge movement for the spring/summer 93 Perry Ellis collection, creative director Marc Jacobs (in sunglasses) riffed on the clothes worn by bands such as Nirvana, with plaid shirts, slip dresses and beanie hats. The press hated it, Jacobs was fired and the collection never went into production – but then the grunge look took off and in 1997 he landed the top job at Louis Vuitton, who were after a designer to create clothes with youth appeal.",Sat 18 Nov 2023 08.00 CET,18.0,11.0,2023.0
501,Guardian,‘The cars’ lights flowed like a river’Koichi Miyase’s best phone picture……,Justin McCurry,"“One evening after finishing work, I looked out of my hotel room window and saw a long traffic jam on the expressway below,” says Koichi Miyase, a Japanese freelance photographer. “I was struck by how the cars’ lights flowed like a river through the city’s buildings.” Miyase often uses his smartphone to capture “casual” scenes. “I’m attracted to them because you can edit photos and post them all in one place on social media.” Using his phone’s regular editing feature, Miyase made what he calls “simple adjustments” to the night-time image of Osaka, which he was visiting for a magazine interview and photoshoot.

You could say it’s a once-in-a-lifetime shot.”",Unknown,,,
